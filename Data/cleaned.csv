cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/cq-brown-nato-trump/index.html,"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown said Monday that “US credibility is at stake” in the wake of comments from former Trump that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO partners that don’t meet spending guidelines on defense. Asked by NBC News about Trump admission that he would not abide by the collective-defense clause at the heart of NATO if reelected, Brown said that the alliance is strong and has been around for 75 years. “I think we have a responsibility to uphold those alliances,” Brown told NBC’s Lester Holt in an interview airing Monday evening. “US credibility is at stake with each of our alliances, and US leadership is still needed, wanted, and watched.” “The US is committed,” Brown added. “And that’s the message I communicate, and that’s the message that’s been received.” Brown’s remarks come as Trump, the 2024 Republican front-runner, has come under fire for his comments over the weekend indicating he does not intend to defend NATO allies from Russian attack if he is reelected. Trump speaks as he holds a campaign rally at Coastal Carolina University ahead of the SouthCarolina Republican presidential primary in Conway, SouthCarolina, on February 10. Sam Wolfe/Reuters Related article Trump will pull US out of NATO if he wins election, ex-adviser warns At a rally in SouthCarolina Saturday, Trump recalled a conversation he had while president with “one of the presidents of a big country,” who asked him whether the US would defend them from a Russian invasion even if they “don’t pay.” “No, I would not protect you,” he recalled saying. “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.” According to NBC , Brown said that he realizes there will be “various dialogue in discussions at the political level,” but that he will focus on “continuing to build and strengthen our relationship with NATO.” “My job is to make sure that we are doing everything we can with our NATO allies on the military aspect,” he said, “and I’ll continue to do that throughout.” Brown, who was sworn in as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff last fall, serves as the principal military advisor to the president. The military officer who serves in the role does so at the pleasure of the president, meaning that if Trump were reelected this year, Brown could serve as his chairman unless he appointed another officer. Gen. Mark Milley , Brown’s predecessor and Trump chairman of the Joint Chiefs throughout his tenure, was a frequent target of Trump ire, and the two have taken verbal - sometimes subtle - shots at each other after Trump left the White House. In late September, at the change of command ceremony between Milley and Brown, the outgoing chairman made it a point to underscore where his loyalty and the loyalty of the military should lie. “We don’t take an oath to a king, or a queen, or a tyrant or a dictator. And we don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,” Milley said at the time, in a veiled reference to Trump. “We take an oath to the Constitution and we take an oath to the idea that is America – and we’re willing to die to protect it.” Milley chose to deliver the scathing criticism of his former boss in his last address as the nation’s top general as he stood next to Biden. In a continuation of the acrimonious feud between the two, Trump fired back on social media, calling Milley a “moron” and “STUPID & VERY DANGEROUS!” Brown addressed recent criticism of his boss Monday following mention of apparent memory lapses in special counsel Robert Hur’s report , calling Biden “pretty sharp.” Asked whether he was surprised by the comments made about the president’s memory, Brown said he was, adding they were “not characteristic of what I’ve seen.” “He’s got a very good grasp of the issues,” Brown said. “He asks, I think, very pertinent questions.” Iran likely ‘not looking for a broader conflict’ with US As the US is navigating increasingly high tensions in the Middle East — from Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria, the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, and Israel’s campaign in Gaza against Hamas — Brown echoed comments made by other US officials that deterrence is key. Broadly, the US is focused on deterring “any further aggression,” Brown said, while also protecting American forces. Asked whether he believed Iran wants a war with the US, Brown responded, “I don’t know that they do.” “Having watched Iran operate, they will do things through their militia groups and others to put pressure, to achieve their objectives,” the chairman said. “At the same time, not looking for a broader conflict with the United States.” There have been at least 170 attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq, Syria and Jordan since October 17. The Pentagon said Monday that those attacks have resulted in 186 wounded or killed in action — including 130 traumatic brain injuries. Three US soldiers were killed in a drone attack in January on a US outpost in Jordan","['chairman', 'joint', 'chiefs', 'staff', 'gen', 'cq', 'brown', 'monday', '“us', 'credibility', 'stake”', 'wake',

Alongside endorsing Whatley, Trump said in a statement that he will also throw his support behind Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, for the role of co-chairwoman at the RNC. Trump endorsement solidifies his effort to bring about a leadership change and exert control over the committee. As part of the plan, Chris LaCivita, Trump co-campaign manager, has been tapped to serve as the RNC chief operating officer but will continue in his current role. “For these reasons, I think my friend Michael Whatley should be the RNC’s next leader. Michael h﻿as been with me from the beginning, has done a great job in his home state of North Carolina, and is committed to election integrity, which we must have to keep fraud out of our election so it can’t be stolen,” Trump said in a statement. “My very talented daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, has agreed to run as the RNC Co-Chair.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/senate-foreign-aid-bill-ukraine/index.html,"The Senate is inching closer to final passage of a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine and Israel after working through the weekend to make progress on the package. But in a sign of the grim odds facing the bill in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson has harshly criticized the package – and many House Republican are opposed to further aid to Ukraine. The Senate has continued to move forward on the bill as Trump has argued the US should not grant foreign aid unless it is a loan, signaling opposition to the legislation. Trump has also indicated he would encourage Russian aggression against any NATO member country that doesn’t pay enough. In a statement on Monday, Johnson criticized the bill, citing its lack of border provisions, saying, the Senate “should have gone back to the drawing board to amend the current bill to include real border security provisions that would actually help end the ongoing catastrophe.” Johnson had previously opposed a broader bill that did include border provisions. The speaker has characterized those provisions as insufficient, despite the fact that they were the product of bipartisan negotiations and included restrictive border measures. A number of Senate Republican either defended or downplayed Trump NATO comments on Monday. “I’m 100% behind him,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville said of Trump saying NATO members should be paying their dues or risk Putin invading their country. The Alabama Republican also suggested European allies should be “very worried” about an invasion, saying they should protect themselves and not rely on the US, adding the country “can’t protect everybody.” Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said European allies who are worried about Trump comments need to “get over it.” “You know, they need to get over it. They need to stand up and be tough. We need to secure our own border first. We need to take care of things here at home first. When we secure our own border, when we take care of home, great. Let’s help other people as well,” the Republican from Kansas said. In the Senate, consideration of the bill has crawled along for days. There is still no time agreement to speed up passage of the bill as Sen. Rand Paul has vowed to drag out the timeline in protest over the legislation. Any one senator can slow down the process and force the Senate to take time-consuming vote to arrive at final passage. Paul continued to dig in on Sunday, saying that he will hold out until “hell freezes over.” He indicated he is ready to hold the floor by speaking on the issue of national debt and other matters. “I love to talk. That’s one of my favorite things to do,” he said. “We do this for a purpose,” Paul said. “I don’t like being here. … I’m not here because it’s fun, I’m here because I don’t think enough people are talking about the danger of the debt.” On Sunday, just hours before the start of the Super Bowl, the chamber took a key vote to move the package forward by a tally of 67 to 27 . There are expected to be two more procedural vote Monday evening. The foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine. The bill includes $60 billion to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia, $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel, $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance and $4.8 billion to support regional partners in the Indo-Pacific region, among other provisions, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Lawmakers are moving forward with the foreign aid bill after Republican blocked the broader bill that would have combined the foreign aid with a bipartisan border deal. Republican had initially demanded that border security be part of the bill, but went on to reject the bipartisan deal amid forceful attacks on the measure by Trump and top House Republican. Over the weekend, Trump also wrote on Truth Social that the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is structured as a loan, another sign of the political pressure Republican continue to face amid efforts to send funding to US allies","['senate', 'inching', 'closer', 'final', 'passage', '953', 'billion', 'foreign', 'aid', 'bill', 'assistance', 'ukraine', 'israel', 'working', 'weekend', 'make', 'progress', 'package', 'sign', 'grim', 'odds', 'facing', 'bill', 'house', 'speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'harshly', 'criticized', 'package', 'many', 'house', 'republican', 'opposed', 'aid', 'ukraine', 'senate', 'continued', 'move', 'forward', 'bill', 'trump', 'argued', 'us', 'grant', 'foreign', 'aid', 'unless', 'loan', 'signaling', 'opposition', 'legislation', 'trump', 'indicated', 'encourage', 'russian', 'aggression', 'nato', 'member', 'country', 'doesn’t', 'pay', 'enough', 'statement', 'monday', 'johnson', 'criticized', 'bill', 'citing', 'lack', 'border', 'provisions', 'saying', 'senate', '“should', 'gone', 'back', 'drawing', 'board', 'amend', 'current', 'bill', 'include', 'real', 'border', 'security', 'provisions', 'actually', 'help', 'end', 'ongoing', 'catastrophe”', 'johnson', 'previously', 'opposed', 'broader', 'bill', 'include', 'border', 'provisions', 'speaker', 'characterized', 'provisions', 'insufficient', 'despite', 'fact', 'product', 'bipartisan', 'negotiations', 'included', 'restrictive', 'border', 'measures', 'number', 'senate', 'republican', 'either', 'defended', 'downplayed', 'trump', 'nato', 'comments', 'monday', '“i’m', '100', 'behind', 'him”', 'sen', 'tommy', 'tuberville', 'trump', 'saying', 'nato', 'members', 'paying', 'dues', 'risk', 'putin', 'invading', 'country', 'alabama', 'republican', 'suggested', 'european', 'allies', '“very', 'worried”', 'invasion', 'saying', 'protect', 'rely', 'us', 'adding', 'country', '“can’t', 'protect', 'everybody”', 'sen', 'roger', 'marshall', 'kansas', 'european', 'allies', 'worried', 'trump', 'comments', 'need', '“get', 'it”', '“you', 'know', 'need', 'need', 'stand', 'tough', 'need', 'secure', 'border', 'first', 'need', 'take', 'care', 'things', 'home', 'first', 'secure', 'border', 'take', 'care', 'home', 'great', 'let’s', 'help', 'people', 'well”', 'republican', 'kansas', 'senate', 'consideration', 'bill', 'crawled', 'along', 'days', 'still', 'agreement', 'speed', 'passage', 'bill', 'sen', 'rand', 'paul', 'vowed', 'drag', 'timeline', 'protest', 'legislation', 'one', 'senator', 'slow', 'process', 'force', 'senate', 'take', 'timeconsuming', 'vote', 'arrive', 'final', 'passage', 'paul', 'continued', 'dig', 'sunday', 'saying', 'hold', '“hell', 'freezes', 'over”', 'indicated', 'ready', 'hold', 'floor', 'speaking', 'issue', 'national', 'debt', 'matters', 'love', 'talk', 'that’s', 'one', 'favorite', 'things', 'do”', '“we', 'purpose”', 'paul', 'don’t', 'like', '…', 'i’m', 'fun', 'i’m', 'don’t', 'enough', 'people', 'talking', 'danger', 'debt”', 'sunday', 'hours', 'start', 'super', 'bowl', 'chamber', 'took', 'key', 'vote', 'move', 'package', 'forward', 'tally', '67', '27', 'expected', 'two', 'procedural', 'vote', 'monday', 'evening', 'foreign', 'aid', 'package', 'includes', 'billions', 'dollars', 'support', 'ukraine', 'security', 'assistance', 'israel', 'well', 'humanitarian', 'assistance', 'civilians', 'gaza', 'west', 'bank', 'ukraine', 'bill', 'includes', '60', 'billion', 'support', 'ukraine', 'fight', 'russia', '141', 'billion', 'security', 'assistance', 'israel', '92', 'billion', 'humanitarian', 'assistance', '48', 'billion', 'support', 'regional', 'partners', 'indopacific', 'region', 'among', 'provisions', 'according', 'senate', 'appropriations', 'committee', 'lawmakers', 'moving', 'forward', 'foreign', 'aid', 'bill', 'republican', 'blocked', 'broader', 'bill', 'combined', 'foreign', 'aid', 'bipartisan', 'border', 'deal', 'republican', 'initially', 'demanded', 'border', 'security', 'part', 'bill', 'went', 'reject', 'bipartisan', 'deal', 'amid', 'forceful', 'attacks', 'measure', 'trump', 'top', 'house', 'republican', 'weekend', 'trump', 'wrote', 'truth', 'social', 'us', 'stop', 'providing', 'foreign', 'aid', 'unless', 'structured', 'loan', 'another', 'sign', 'political', 'pressure', 'republican', 'continue', 'face', 'amid', 'efforts', 'send', 'funding', 'us', 'allies']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/bidens-meeting-with-jordanian-king-comes-at-flashpoint-in-israel-hamas-war/index.html,"Biden and King Abdullah II of Jordan met Monday aiming to figure out how to move the Israel-Hamas war into a new phase in which Israeli hostages are released and fighting stops for a prolonged period of time. “The key elements of the deal are on the table,” Biden said while addressing reporters alongside the king at the White House. “There are gaps that remain, but I’ve encouraged Israeli leaders to keep working to achieve the deal. The United States will do everything possible to make it happen.” Biden did not elaborate on what the “gaps” in the deal are. He added that a planned Israeli operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah should not go forward without a “credible plan” to protect civilians. “Many people there have been displaced, displaced multiple times,” Biden said from the White House on Monday, “fleeing the violence to the north, and now they’re packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable.” “They need to be protected,” Biden added. Biden added that he and Abdullah discussed “a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, which would bring immediate and sustained period of calm into Gaza, for at least six weeks, which we could then take the time to build into something more enduring,” during the meeting. But Abdullah, the first Arab leader to visit the White House since Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, went further – reiterating his call for a complete ceasefire, which Biden has so far resisted. “We cannot stand by and let this continue,” the Jordanian king told reporters. “We need a lasting ceasefire now. This war must end.” He said it was essential the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the main United Nations agency responsible for Gaza, continues to receive funding. The agency warned earlier this month it may have to halt its work in Gaza after the US and other nations withdrew support last month over allegations some of its staff were involved with Hamas’ October 7 attack. Abdullah also said in his remarks that a ground operation in Rafah would amount to devastation, adding it would “produce another humanitarian catastrophe.” “The situation is already unbearable for over a million people who have been pushed into Rafah since the war started,” Abdullah said. While the Jordanian king called Biden a “dear friend” and said the president’s leadership is “key to addressing this conflict,” the open rifts between Biden and Abdullah underscored the delicate diplomatic balance the president is facing as the war in Gaza enters its fifth month – and as he faces a possible inflection point in his presidency. In the wake of special counsel Robert Hur’s report , which contained politically embarrassing passages about the president’s memory, Biden is facing perhaps the most scrutiny of his presidency over his mental acuity. The 81-year-old president’s age is his biggest political problem, and the special counsel’s report has struck a nerve, as evidenced by Biden amped-up news conference just hours after it published. But that domestic political pressure has not obscured the foreign crises that have occupied much of the president’s term in office, and it was during that news conference that Biden leveled his latest ramped-up criticism at Israel, calling its response to the October 7 terror attack “over the top.” The president was aiming to show off his command of the issues at hand when King Abdullah, a key regional ally who has been critical of Israel’s campaign in Gaza, comes to the West Wing. The president’s supporters have frequently pointed to the Israel-Hamas war as evidence of Biden mental faculties being in good shape. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday pushed back against concerns about the president’s age as she recounted in detail the experience serving alongside Biden in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7 attack, noting that she was in “almost every meeting” with him and his national security team in the days that followed. Biden sat for interviews with Hur on October 8 and 9. “The president was in front of and on top of it all, asking questions and requiring that America’s military and intelligence community and diplomatic community would figure out and know – how many people are dead, how many Americans, how many hostages, is the situation stable?” Harris said. And Democrat Rep. Daniel Goldman of NewYork, who spoke by phone with Biden a day ahead of his October 8 interview with Hur, said the president was “sharper than anyone I’ve spoken to” about the situation in the Middle East. In his meeting with King Abdullah, Biden had some high-pressure issues to work through as the Jordanians have called on the White House to put more pressure on Israel over its campaign against Hamas in Gaza, which has taken an immense humanitarian toll. Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority canceled a planned meeting with Biden less than 24 hours before a planned four-way summit in the Jordanian capital, Amman, in October when he traveled to Israel. The cancellation followed a massive blast in Gaza’s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital that reportedly killed hundreds of Palestinians. The Jordanian and Egyptian governments have called for a ceasefire in Gaza, while Biden has resisted making a similar call. And the meeting came just weeks after three American soldiers were killed during an attack at a base in Jordan last month, prompting the US to launch dozens of retaliatory strikes that targeted Iran-backed militias. But the top order of business was how to achieve a cessation to fighting that also involves the release of hostages still held by Hamas since the October 7 terror attack on Israel. There are 136 hostages being held in Gaza, including 132 who were captured during Hamas’ October 7 attack. Twenty-nine of the hostages are dead, according to the Israeli prime minister’s office. Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed a deal to secure the release of hostages in Gaza at length on Sunday, according to a senior administration official, who cautioned that while a framework is in place, gaps remain. Over the last several months, the US has attempted to put more pressure on the Israeli government to support a “humanitarian pause” in its war against Hamas. But those efforts have yielded little success. Last week, Netanyahu called Hamas’ recent proposals for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza “delusional.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken previously said negotiations toward an agreement would continue despite the Israeli prime minister’s comments, which Blinken said were referencing the “absolute non-starters” in the proposal. The full Hamas response proposes three phases, each lasting 45 days, including the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, a massive humanitarian effort, and freedom of movement for people throughout Gaza, according to a copy obtained by CNN","['biden', 'king', 'abdullah', 'ii', 'jordan', 'met', 'monday', 'aiming', 'figure', 'move', 'israelhamas', 'war', 'new', 'phase', 'israeli', 'hostages',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-supreme-court-immunity-filing/index.html,"Trump on Monday asked the SupremeCourt to step into the charged dispute over whether he may claim immunity from prosecution, once again pressing the nine justices to resolve a question that could undermine his campaign for a second term. Trump asked the SupremeCourt to temporarily block a scathing and unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down last week that flatly rejected his claims of immunity from election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. “Conducting a months-long criminal trial of Trump at the height of election season will radically disrupt Trump’s ability to campaign against Biden,” Trump attorneys wrote in their request. RENO, NEVADA - DECEMBER 17: Republican presidential candidate former U.S. Trump delivers remarks during a campaign rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center on December 17, 2023 in Reno, Nevada. Former U.S. Trump held a campaign rally as he battles to become the Republican Presidential nominee for the 2024 Presidential election. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Related article Takeaways from the scathing appeals court ruling denying immunity to Trump The DC Circuit’s ruling “threatens immediate irreparable injury to the First Amendment interests of Trump and tens of millions of American voter, who are entitled to hear Trump’s campaign message as they decide how to cast their ballots in November.” The emergency filing instantly shoves the SupremeCourt into the unusual position of having to juggle two politically fraught matters involving the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Four days ago, the court heard a historic argument over whether Trump should be disqualified from the ballot for his actions on January 6, 2021. How the SupremeCourt responds to Trump request will have huge influence on whether – and how quickly – the former president will be put on trial for criminal allegations as he seeks the Republican nomination and presidency again. Trump took the unusual step of saying he might seek to two avenues to appeal the earlier decision: An appeal to the SupremeCourt and, potentially, a separate rehearing before the full DC Circuit. That move underscored Trump unusual position in a case where he was incentivized to file at the SupremeCourt but also wants to preserve his ability to keep the immunity question before the appeals court. “Former Trump is making it rather clear that his goal is to stretch out these proceedings as much as possible,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN SupremeCourt analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. While that won’t necessarily stop the justices from treating the filing as an appeal, “it underscores Trump unambiguous endgame here, which is to play out the string for as long as the courts will let him,” Vladeck added. A panel of three DC Circuit judges set an aggressive timeline for Trump to appeal, nudging him directly to the SupremeCourt and effectively requiring him to make his request by Monday. A key part of Trump legal strategy has been to delay his criminal cases until after the 2024 election. The fight over Trump immunity had already prompted US District Judge Tanya Chutkan to postpone a trial date previously set for March 4. Chief Justice John Roberts, who handles emergency appeals from the DC Circuit, will likely set out a schedule quickly that will offer clues about the timing. Smith, eager to avoid further delay in starting a trial, is expected to push for a quick resolution. Generally, it takes the vote of five justices to grant a stay. At issue is a striking 57-page unanimous opinion from the DC Circuit on Tuesday that allowed Trump to face charges for actions he took while in office and brushed aside his claims that former presidents are immune from such prosecution. “We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter,” the court wrote. “Former Trump lacked any lawful discretionary authority to defy federal criminal law and he is answerable in court for his conduct.” Broadly, Trump argued in court that presidents might be hesitant to act if they were concerned about the prospect of criminal charges after they left office. His criminal indictment in the 2020 election interference probe, if allowed to stand, would have a “chilling effect” on future administrations, he said. But US Circuit Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Florence Pan and J. Michelle Childs rejected all of Trump arguments that those principles conferred sweeping protections to a former president. The judges were clear that the allegations against Trump are serious and left no question they believe the charges can be prosecuted. The panel repeatedly eviscerated Trump alleged behavior after the 2020 presidential election as unpresidential and constituting an assault on American institutions. The case has already made its way to the SupremeCourt once before. In December, the justices rejected a request from Smith to leapfrog the DC Circuit and decide the immunity question on an expedited basis. At that time, the court did not explain its reasoning and there were no noted dissents. Trump lawyers referenced the earlier decision in the very first line of their brief, quoting the renowned late Yankees catcher Yogi Berra. “This application is ‘déjà vu all over again,’” Trump attorneys wrote. During more than two hours of oral arguments Thursday in the separate ballot case, most of the justices appeared willing to side with Trump on the question of whether he can appear on the ballot or if his actions on January 6 made him ineligible under the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban.” The court may have to decide how it wants to handle the former president’s immunity claim at the same time it is drafting an opinion in the ballot case. Together, the cases have thrust the court into the middle of this year’s presidential election in a way it has largely managed to avoid since its decision in Bush v. Gore effectively decided the 2000 election between former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Al Gore.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/house-republicans-robert-hur/index.html,"House Republican have reached out to special counsel Robert Hur to discuss having him testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee about his report on Biden’s handling of classified documents, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Hur’s report released last week did not charge the president with a crime, but it painted a picture of a forgetful commander in chief who failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information – a depiction that could hurt Biden politically and that Republican have seized on. Hur has retained Bill Burck as his personal attorney. While there is no date on the calendar, they are looking toward the end of February, one of the sources told CNN. The Justice Department declined to comment. In the wake of the report, House Oversight Chairman James Comer has separately said the Justice Department should provide his committee with all of the classified materials that could relate to the Republican-led impeachment inquiry into the president. “The Justice Department must provide Congress with unfettered access to these documents to determine if Biden’s retention of sensitive materials were used to help the Biden’ influence peddling schemes,” Comer said in a statement provided to CNN. House Oversight Republican have also called on the Justice Department to release the full transcript of the president’s interview with the special counsel that is quoted in the final report. The two special counsels appointed during the Trump presidency, Robert Mueller and John Durham, both testified to Congress once they submitted their reports to the Justice Department. After expressing some reluctance, Mueller agreed to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees in July 2019 about his investigation, delivering halting and stilted responses that mostly stuck to his report. The negotiations for Mueller’s appearance stretched out for weeks, ultimately leading to an agreement where Mueller appeared after he was subpoenaed. Last June, Durham testified to the House Judiciary Committee about his investigation and report into the FBI’s probe into Trump and Russia, and he spoke behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee. Hur’s special counsel report found that Biden willfully retained classified information, including top secret documents, and knew he was in possession of some documents as far back as 2017. He also shared some of that information with the ghostwriter of his 2017 memoir. The special counsel decided not to charge the president in the case – primarily because he found that nothing proved a willful intent by Biden to illegally hold onto classified information and the president cooperated with the investigation. Yet, in a politically damaging line of reasoning, Hur wrote that one reason Biden wasn’t going to be prosecuted was because he would present to a jury as an elderly man “with a poor memory.” Biden lawyers objected to the description – calling it “investigative excess” and accusing Hur of flouting Justice Department rules and norms. The report is sure to become an issue in the 2024 campaign – where Biden likely opponent, Trump, is facing criminal charges for his handling of classified material, even though Hur made clear how different the two cases were.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/nikki-haley-husband-trump-attack/index.html,"Former SouthCarolina Gov. Nikki Haley is hammering Trump over his comments mocking the absence of her husband , who is deployed overseas, and using the former president’s remarks to highlight his long history of disparaging members of the military. The strategy is unlikely to change the dynamics of the GOP primary ahead of her home state’s February 24 primary. But it showcases how her continued presence in the race has presented a thorn in Trump side, as she continues to criticize and provoke him in ads, on cable TV and on the campaign trail. In interviews, fundraising messages and a new digital ad, Haley has framed the former president’s comments as part of an ongoing pattern of disrespect toward military members and their service and says it is further evidence that he would run an undisciplined general election campaign and presidency. Haley called Trump comments “disgusting,” “awful” and “unhinged” during an appearance on “The Lead with Jake Tapper.” Someone who would make such comments doesn’t deserve to be commander in chief, she said. “If you don’t respect our military, how should we think you’re going to respect them when it comes to times of war, and prevent war and keep them from going?” Haley said Monday. “If you don’t have respect for our military and our veterans, God help us all if that’s the case.” Haley made the comments after spending most of Monday blasting Trump. During a gaggle with reporters in Elgin, SouthCarolina, Monday afternoon, she said his comments put servicemembers at risk by implying Trump doesn’t support them and called out his own lack of military experience. “The most harm he’s ever come across is whether a golf ball hits him on a golf cart,” she told reporters. “And you’re gonna go and mock our men and women in the military? I don’t care what party you’re in, that’s not okay.” Neither Trump nor Haley has served in the military. Trump avoided being drafted into the Vietnam War due to five deferments, one for bone spurs and four for education. Her campaign has pointed to several comments Trump has made both publicly or privately over the years. In September 2020, the Atlantic reported that Trump called soldiers who died in combat “losers” and “suckers” and questioned why veterans buried at Arlington National Cemetery would enlist. John Kelly, a former Trump chief of staff, confirmed several details in the report to CNN last year. In 2015, during his first presidential run, Trump said he liked “people who weren’t captured” as he attacked Sen. John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Three years later, he suggested retired Navy Adm. William McRaven, who oversaw the military operation that killed Osama bin Laden, should have completed the mission sooner. On Saturday, Trump noted that Haley’s husband, Michael, has not appeared on the campaign trail with her. “What happened to her husband? Where is he?” Trump said at a rally Saturday in Conway, SouthCarolina. “He’s gone.” Michael Haley is an officer of the SouthCarolina Army National Guard who is currently deployed supporting the US Africa Command. Throughout her campaign, Nikki Haley has pointed to her husband’s military service to make the case for investing more in services for veterans and to push back on criticisms that she’s too hawkish. Her campaign has said they’ve engaged with voter who were angered by his comments, noting the Palmetto State is home to a large swath of military families. It’s not clear that hitting Trump over his comments will change the dynamics in the race. A recent Monmouth/Washington Post poll in SouthCarolina found Haley trailing Trump by 26 points in the state, and her campaign has struggled to outline her path to the nomination. But her response has demonstrated where Trump might be weak in the general election. On Sunday, Biden – Trump likely general election opponent – defended the Haleys on X, formerly known as Twitter. “We know he thinks our troops are ‘suckers,’ but this guy wouldn’t know service to his country if it slapped him in the face,” Biden wrote on the site. For her part, Haley’s criticisms of Trump only intensified on Monday. Her campaign has fundraised off the comments, offering shirts that say “We Love Our Military” to supporters who donate $15 to her campaign. Also on Monday, her campaign released a digital ad highlighting Trump history of disparaging remarks towards members of the military with news clips and video of her response to Trump at a rally in SouthCarolina over the weekend, in which she called on him to debate her. “If you mock the service of a combat veteran, you don’t deserve a driver’s license, let alone being president of the United States,” she says in the ad. And she continued to knock Trump at campaign events in SouthCarolina Monday. “You can’t have a commander-in-chief that doesn’t understand what made this country great,” Haley said at a stop in Laurens, SouthCarolina. “It’s the values, it’s the sacrifice, it’s the freedom. That’s what we fight for every day.”","['southcarolina', 'gov', 'nikki', 'haley', 'hammering', 'trump', 'comments', 'mocking', 'absence', 'husband', 'deployed', 'overseas', 'using', 'president’s', 'remarks', 'highlight', 'long', 'history', 'disparaging', 'members', 'military', 'strategy', 'unlikely', 'change', 'dynamics', 'gop', 'primary', 'ahead', 'home', 'state’s', 'february', '24', 'primary', 'showcases', 'continued', 'presence', 'race', 'presented', 'thorn', 'trump', 'side', 'continues', 'criticize', 'provoke', 'ads', 'cable', 'tv', 'campaign', 'trail', 'interviews', 'fundraising', 'messages', 'new', 'ad', 'haley', 'framed', 'president’s', 'comments', 'part', 'ongoing', 'pattern', 'disrespect', 'toward', 'military', 'members', 'service', 'evidence', 'run', 'undisciplined', 'general', 'election', 'campaign', 'presidency', 'haley', 'called', 'trump', 'comments', '“disgusting”', '“awful”', '“unhinged”', 'appearance', '“the', 'lead', 'jake', 'tapper”', 'someone', 'make', 'comments', 'doesn’t', 'deserve', 'commander', 'chief', '“if', 'don’t', 'respect', 'military', 'you’re', 'going', 'respect', 'comes', 'times', 'war', 'prevent', 'war', 'keep', 'going”', 'haley', 'monday', '“if', 'don’t', 'respect', 'military', 'veterans', 'god', 'help', 'us', 'that’s', 'case”', 'haley', 'made', 'comments', 'spending', 'monday', 'blasting', 'trump', 'gaggle', 'reporters', 'elgin', 'southcarolina', 'monday', 'afternoon', 'comments', 'put', 'servicemembers', 'risk', 'implying', 'trump', 'doesn’t', 'support', 'called', 'lack', 'military', 'experience', '“the', 'harm', 'he’s', 'ever', 'come', 'across', 'whether', 'golf', 'ball', 'hits', 'golf', 'cart”', 'reporters', '“and', 'you’re', 'gonna', 'go', 'mock', 'men', 'women', 'military', 'don’t', 'care', 'you’re', 'that’s', 'okay”', 'neither', 'trump', 'haley', 'served', 'military', 'trump', 'avoided', 'drafted', 'vietnam', 'war', 'due', 'five', 'deferments', 'one', 'bone', 'spurs', 'four', 'education', 'campaign', 'pointed', 'several', 'comments', 'trump', 'made', 'publicly', 'privately', 'years', 'september', '2020', 'atlantic', 'reported', 'trump', 'called', 'soldiers', 'died', 'combat', '“losers”', '“suckers”', 'questioned', 'veterans', 'buried', 'arlington', 'national', 'cemetery', 'enlist', 'john', 'kelly', 'trump', 'chief', 'staff', 'confirmed', 'several', 'details', 'report', 'last', 'year', '2015', 'first', 'presidential', 'run', 'trump', 'liked', '“people', 'weren’t', 'captured”', 'attacked', 'sen', 'john', 'mccain', 'prisoner', 'war', 'vietnam', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'suggested', 'retired', 'navy', 'adm', 'william', 'mcraven', 'oversaw', 'military', 'operation', 'killed', 'osama', 'bin', 'laden', 'completed', 'mission', 'sooner', 'saturday', 'trump', 'noted', 'haley’s', 'husband', 'michael', 'appeared', 'campaign', 'trail', '“what', 'happened', 'husband', 'he”', 'trump', 'rally', 'saturday', 'conway', 'southcarolina', '“he’s', 'gone”', 'michael', 'haley', 'officer', 'southcarolina', 'army', 'national', 'guard', 'currently', 'deployed', 'supporting', 'us', 'africa', 'command', 'throughout', 'campaign', 'nikki', 'haley', 'pointed', 'husband’s', 'military', 'service', 'make', 'case', 'investing', 'services', 'veterans', 'push', 'back', 'criticisms', 'hawkish', 'campaign', 'they’ve', 'engaged', 'voter', 'angered', 'comments', 'noting', 'palmetto', 'state', 'home', 'large', 'swath', 'military', 'families', 'clear', 'hitting', 'trump', 'comments', 'change', 'dynamics', 'race', 'recent', 'monmouthwashington', 'post', 'poll', 'southcarolina', 'found', 'haley', 'trailing', 'trump', '26', 'points', 'state', 'campaign', 'struggled', 'outline', 'path', 'nomination', 'response', 'demonstrated', 'trump', 'might', 'weak', 'general', 'election', 'sunday', 'biden', 'trump', 'likely', 'general', 'election', 'opponent', 'defended', 'haleys', 'x', 'formerly', 'known', 'twitter', '“we', 'know', 'thinks', 'troops', '‘suckers’', 'guy', 'wouldn’t', 'know', 'service', 'country', 'slapped', 'face”', 'biden', 'wrote', 'site', 'part', 'haley’s', 'criticisms', 'trump', 'intensified', 'monday', 'campaign', 'fundraised', 'comments', 'offering', 'shirts', 'say', '“we', 'love', 'military”', 'supporters', 'donate', '15', 'campaign', 'monday', 'campaign', 'released', 'ad', 'highlighting', 'trump', 'history', 'disparaging', 'remarks', 'towards', 'members', 'military', 'clips', 'video', 'response', 'trump', 'rally', 'southcarolina', 'weekend', 'called', 'debate', '“if', 'mock', 'service', 'combat', 'veteran', 'don’t', 'deserve', 'driver’s', 'license', 'let', 'alone', 'president', 'united', 'states”', 'ad', 'continued', 'knock', 'trump', 'campaign', 'events', 'southcarolina', 'monday', '“you', 'can’t', 'commanderinchief', 'doesn’t', 'understand', 'made', 'country', 'great”', 'haley', 'stop', 'laurens', 'southcarolina', '“it’s', 'values', 'sacrifice', 'freedom', 'that’s', 'fight', 'every', 'day”']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/biden-campaign-channels-jill-bidens-frustration-over-special-counsel-report/index.html,"The renewed questions surrounding Biden’s age and memory sparked by a special counsel report last week were decidedly unwelcome for the 81-year-old Democrat’s advisers. Yet in one area, the president’s team has found a way of making political hay from one of the president’s deepest political vulnerabilities . A fundraising appeal sent Saturday from first lady Dr. Jill Biden criticizing the special counsel and defending her husband was the second-most lucrative money-raising email since the president’s launch announcement, a source familiar with the figures said. The source declined to offer an exact amount raised, but what made the email unique is that the first lady made no explicit ask for supporters to give money to the campaign in the body of her message. Instead, the message included a button with a link to donate after the first lady signed off, “Love, Jill.” The success of the fundraising message, in which Jill Biden argued special counsel Robert Hur’s report contains “inaccurate and personal political attacks against Joe,” speaks to a silver lining amid the questions about Biden age, which had been festering well before the release of Hur’s report last week. In many ways, the lengthy document forced Biden team to more forcefully address an issue that had been lingering uncomfortably for months, as voter expressed deep concerns about the president’s ability to serve a second term. For months, White House aides have sought to avoid moments that might highlight Biden advanced years, like using a smaller flight of stairs to board Air Force One. The president has also conducted few sit-down interviews and held fewer news conferences, though he frequently answers reporters’ questions in less formal settings. The president and his advisers have bristled at questions about Biden cognitive abilities and advanced age, and have claimed interest in the issue is a media obsession. Yet the release of Hur’s report thrust those questions to the center of the election, requiring the White House and campaign to tackle the age concerns more head-on. Speaking to a group of county executives Monday, Biden himself seemed to make a veiled allusion to the report and its questioning of his recall abilities. “I know I don’t look like it, but I’ve been around a while,” the president told the group in Washington. “I do remember that,” he added with a smirk, to loud applause. In voicing indignation at Hur’s treatment of the matter in his report – and in particular expressing frustration with the special counsel claiming her husband couldn’t remember when their son Beau died – Jill Biden struck upon a potent message for Democrat. “Believe me, like anyone who has lost a child, Beau and his death never leave him. I hope you can imagine how it felt to read that attack – not just as Joe’s wife, but as Beau’s mother,” Dr. Biden wrote. “I don’t know what this Special Counsel was trying to achieve. We should give everyone grace, and I can’t imagine someone would try to use our son’s death to score political points.” Yet she also sought to link Biden age – a number that will only get higher, and which no official has any ability to change – to experience, an argument that Biden himself has made only sporadically as the general election gets underway. “Joe is 81, that’s true, but he’s 81 doing more in an hour than most people do in a day,” she wrote. “Joe has wisdom, empathy, and vision. He has delivered on so many of his promises as President precisely because he’s learned a lot in those 81 years. His age, with his experience and expertise, is an incredible asset and he proves it every day.” The first lady was involved in crafting the response, which a source close to her said “was from the heart.” Jill Biden felt the “Beau attack was beyond the pale and the attacks on his age were flat inaccurate,” the source said, noting the first lady “wanted to make clear that the American people benefit from his 81 years.” Over the weekend, the president’s social media account also posted a photo of Biden playing football with his sons Beau and Hunter. “1987 with my boys,” the president’s account wrote. Hur’s reference of Beau – who died from brain cancer in 2015 – angered the president the most, prompting him to tell Democrat lawmakers in private, “How would I f***ing” forget” a date etched in his memory. “As legal experts around the country are saying, it just goes off the rails. It’s a shabby piece of work,” Biden personal attorney, Bob Bauer, told CBS of the report. In a fundraising appeal on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris joined the Biden in criticizing the report’s contents. “As a former prosecutor, I can tell you firsthand that the comments that were made by the Special Counsel were unnecessary, inaccurate, and inappropriate,” Harris wrote. “The way that the President’s demeanor was characterized in that report could not be more wrong. It was clearly politically motivated.” Harris also detailed Biden response in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 on Israel, calling the hours before the special counsel’s interview with the president “an intense moment for the Commander in Chief of the United States.” “When it comes to the role and responsibility of a prosecutor in a situation like that, we should expect a higher level of integrity than what we saw. Nevertheless, I want you to know the Joe that I know,” Harris wrote. “I’ve been with Joe in the Oval Office when the cameras are there, and when they are not. I’ve watched him bring folks together across the nation and across the world. He is an incredible leader.” Mitch Landrieu, who recently left a White House post to become a co-chair of Biden campaign, said the report was an “ad hominem attack that questioned the president’s capacity” and didn’t reflect his own experiences. “This guy is tough. He’s smart. He’s on his game,” he said on NBC.","['renewed', 'questions', 'surrounding', 'biden’s', 'age', 'memory', 'sparked', 'special', 'counsel', 'report', 'last', 'week', 'decidedly', 'unwelcome',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/presidential-candidate-race-drop-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — While the 2024 presidential race seems set in stone as a rematch between Biden and former Trump, it’s also true that things happen. Back in November 1872, for instance, the newspaper publisher and Democrat presidential candidate Horace Greeley died after Election Day but before the casting of Electoral College vote. While it did not affect the outcome – President Ulysses S. Grant easily won reelection – Greeley’s death created the difficult question of what to do with the 66 Electoral College vote he had won. Most electors, meeting in state capitols, did not cast vote for the deceased Greeley, but rather split them among four other candidates . Congress did not count the three vote that were cast for a dead man. Pictured is American abolitionist, journalist and politician Horace Greeley, who edited the NewYork Tribune. MPI/Getty Images In the more than 150 years since Greeley’s death, there have been two constitutional amendments related to presidential succession, but there is still some gray area when it comes to an unforeseen event that strikes a presidential nominee or candidate. Today, polling suggests voter are worried that both Trump and Biden are too old for the job. Trump will be 78 on Election Day in November, and Biden will turn 82 later that month. Without being macabre, it’s worth knowing what would happen if, for whatever reason, either man was unable to continue with the race. Replacing either man on the ballot – not that anyone is seriously talking about it – would be a messy and chaotic process that would uncover divisions and disagreements within the political parties. No one knows for sure what would happen if a candidate died or for some reason needed to withdraw from the race. Here’s a look at the rules for Republican and Democrat as they currently stand. What happens if a candidate cannot continue his or her campaign? The process of replacing a presidential candidate very much depends on when the vacancy occurs – during the primary process and before the party convention; during the convention or after the convention; or before or after people vote in November. What happens if a vacancy occurs during the primary process? While Trump and Biden are in total command of the respective races to be the Republican and Democrat presidential candidates, that process will play out between now and June as states conduct primaries and caucuses and assign delegates based on the results. If a vacancy on either side happens before most of those primaries were to occur, it’s possible that another candidate could emerge and rack up some delegates. But since filing deadlines have already passed for many primaries, it’s unlikely any single candidate, other than Trump or Biden, could rack up enough delegates to win the nomination before party conventions this summer. It is, however, possible that states could decide to delay their primaries, according to Elaine Kamarck , a member of the Democrat National Committee rules committee and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied the issue. Republican will hold their convention in Milwaukee in July, and Democrat will hold theirs just to the south in Chicago in August. Most delegates will have been awarded by the end of March. Biden has not faced serious opposition in the Democrat primary, has won every delegate at stake so far and needs to win at least 1,968 of 3,934 to secure the nomination on the first ballot of voting. On the Republican side, Trump has won every contest so far and ultimately needs 1,215 of 2,429 delegates. His top rival, former SouthCarolina Gov. Nikki Haley, is far behind Trump in the delegate race. What if a vacancy occurs after the primaries and before or during the convention? If the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would likely decide the party’s nominee on the convention floor. That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. There would be a messy political battle in every state over who would get to be a delegate and then who they would ultimately support. Even people who did not run primary campaigns could ultimately be considered. You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to be on the ballot if, for some reason, Biden left the race. At the same time, given Haley’s weakness in primaries, it seems unlikely that Republican would coalesce around her if Trump was unable to run. On the Democrat side, there would also be another group to consider: the “superdelegates,” a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can’t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they’re free to vote on subsequent ballots. Has anything like this ever happened before? The modern primary and caucus system evolved only in recent generations as voter demanded more involvement in the nominating process. The election that sparked change was in 1968, when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run after an embarrassing finish in New Hampshire’s primary. Johnson won, but just barely. When he dropped out of the presidential race, it set off a chaotic dash to replace him. One candidate who jumped in the race, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Los Angeles just after winning the California primary, creating the difficult question of who his delegates should support. The ultimate Democrat winner that year, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, amassed his delegates in states that did not conduct primaries, securing enough support to win the nomination. Violence on the streets of Chicago around the convention marred the event and helped inspire the system of primaries and caucuses we have today where voter pick presidential candidates through delegates bound to support a specific candidate. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party’s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrat and Republican have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrat – The Democrat National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democrat governors and congressional leadership. Republican – If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth Congressional Research Service memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party’s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party’s nominee. Neither party, according to CRS, requires that the presidential candidate’s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, but that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness. The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democrat nominee George McGovern’s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast vote for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College vote on January 6?","['version', 'appeared', 'cnn’s', 'matters', 'newsletter', 'inbox', 'sign', 'free',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-biden-election-2024/index.html,"Biden and former Trump are each offering a stark glimpse at the political liabilities that have many Americans wishing they had other options in 2024. Biden, 81, is angrily refuting questions about his age and memory, struggling to lay to rest anxiety among voter that he wouldn’t be capable of serving a full second term. But far from exploiting the president’s rough patch, Trump offered a stunning display of extremism at the weekend, raising fresh questions over his fitness for the Oval Office. The comparison between the likely general election opponents helps explain why polls show limited enthusiasm for both men, each of whom is unpopular outside their core constituencies. Biden would be the more conventional choice because Trump is promising one of the most tumultuous second terms in US history. But as the president’s campaign gathers pace, his troubles are complicating his effort to convince Americans that Trump would destroy American democracy and would shatter the country’s reputation abroad. Trump is giving every impression that his second term would be even more aberrant than his first, as he vows to use presidential power to exact retribution against his enemies. But he’s nevertheless closely matched with Biden in polling and has a real chance to win. While a Biden vs. Trump race would be a rematch of 2020, it would not necessarily be the same. The sitting president is four years older, and age questions are even more acute. And Trump is even more radical and unchained than when he left office. How Biden and Trump are putting their political weaknesses on display The different liabilities both would bring to the race were on display during the frantic last few days. In Trump, voter can pick an ex-president facing 91 criminal charges who has been found liable for fraud, sexual battery and defamation in court. Trump, 77, tried to stay in power after losing reelection in 2020. This weekend, Trump sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over NATO allies and mocked the military service of GOP rival Nikki Haley’s husband. This week, the ex-president faces a set of court deadlines and hearings that will renew the focus on his seemingly endless threats to the rule of law. In Biden, voter must decide whether to reelect the oldest president ever, at 81, who is angrily refuting claims of a declining memory following a damning assessment of his faculties by a special counsel. The president, who warns Trump is a danger to democracy , is visibly aging while mixing up the names of foreign leaders , and polls show overwhelming skepticism among the public about his reelection plans. The key question voter will face is not whether Biden is fit to serve as commander in chief now, but rather: Will he still be by the end of a second term, when he would be 86? Multiple polls have shown how little voter like the alternatives they will almost certainly get in the 2024 election. And while partisans may already be locked in, the comparison between the sitting president and the former one, both of whom crave a second term, will be critical in the handful of swing states where a relatively small number of voter will be decisive. The debate over Biden age and Trump fitness for office help explain why there’s a possibility that several third-party or independent candidates — for instance, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — could have an outsize impact on the destiny of the White House. But while speculation will mount about how either party might thwart a 2020 election replay, practical impediments make the idea of dumping a potential nominee an almost unthinkable scenario. Trump wild weekend tear Over the weekend, Trump showed how his uncontrolled stream of rhetoric and insults can often be politically counterproductive and play into the core narratives of Biden campaign. In a shocking remark at a rally in SouthCarolina on Saturday, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that didn’t meet the alliance’s guidelines for defense spending. Trump comments reveal his view of NATO not as the main driver of peace in Europe for half a century but as a protection racket. His comments are also dangerous, since the alliance’s credibility relies on Russia believing that members would defend an ally that was attacked, in line with Article 5 commitments. Any sense this is false could lead to miscalculations in Moscow. And this is just the latest in a long list of occasions in which the ex-president has appeared to indulge Putin’s goals instead of traditional US national interests. Biden warned in a statement that his likely opponent was unsuitable to be commander in chief. “Trump admission that he intends to give Putin a greenlight for more war and violence, to continue his brutal assault against a free Ukraine, and to expand his aggression to the people of Poland and the Baltic States are appalling and dangerous,” Biden said. Trump defenders insist his comments are merely a ruse to get NATO members — some of whom are still short of their targets — to spend more on defense. Defense spending rose in some cases following Trump pressure in his first term — although his ranting about NATO members not paying their “bills” was not the only factor. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who was a conventional hawkish conservative when he ran against Trump in 2016, defended the ex-president Sunday. “Trump is not a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,” Rubio said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “He doesn’t talk like a traditional politician, and we’ve already been through this. You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.” Still, Trump caused alarm in Europe. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, called his remarks “reckless.” And Trump statement will refuel speculation about the odd nature of his relationship with Putin, who is accused of war crimes and has directly targeted civilians in Ukraine. It will also renew fears that Trump would try to pull the US out of NATO if he’s reelected, which would delight Russia. Trump comments also come as his GOP allies, especially in the House, are trying to thwart Biden new aid package for Ukraine, a sovereign democracy invaded by the Russian autocrat in the widest European land war since World War II. And the sympathetic interview of Putin last week by Tucker Carlson, the far-right populist broadcaster, only underscores the Trump GOP’s embrace of Putinism. Trump speaks in Conway, SouthCarolina, on February 10, 2024. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Trump contempt for those who serve in the military — was also highlighted in his SouthCarolina speech. He asked of Haley’s husband, Michael: “Where is he? He’s gone,” apparently arguing that his rival’s spouse knew her campaign would not do well. Michael Haley is on a yearlong deployment in Africa. Nikki Haley targeted Trump on X, saying: “Michael is deployed serving our country, something you know nothing about. Someone who continually disrespects the sacrifices of military families has no business being commander in chief.” This is far from the first time that Trump has disparaged the military service of political opponents. He’s still attacking the late Arizona Sen. John McCain after mocking his incarceration and the injuries he sustained when his plane went down and he was tortured during the Vietnam War. Trump conduct was not just typical of the way he has crushed every tradition of presidential decorum. It also offered a potential roadmap to the substance and character of his possible second term. At the same time, Trump weekend eruptions also show why he may be a compromised general-election candidate. They played directly into Biden claims that he’s too extreme and too morally challenged to be president again. And Trump latest outbursts are politically self-defeating: They took attention away from Biden frantic attempts at damage control following special counsel Robert Hur’s devastating assessment of Biden as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Much has been written about the new, disciplined Trump campaign. But the ex-president is reminding voter of his volatile first term, which included two impeachments. Biden struggles to parry increasing worries about his age The White House and Biden allies spent the weekend fighting back following a late Thursday news conference at which the president vented about Hur’s findings. The event may have exacerbated Biden political problems since he mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico, following several similar occasions last week when he referred to long-dead European leaders with whom he interacted in the 1980s rather their more recent successors. The acute political problem Biden faces was underscored by a new ABC News/Ipsos poll published Sunday in which 86% of Americans said Biden was too old to serve another term. The figure includes 59% of Americans who think both he and Trump are too old and 27% who think only Biden is too old. Biden speaks at the White House on February 8, 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Here’s Biden problem: It’s politically corrosive when a critical narrative takes hold about a president and subsequent events appear to validate it. Every flub or mistake the president makes — after a lifetime of verbal slips and gaffes — now plays into the perception that he’s losing his grip mentally. And his age is a political problem that can’t be fixed. The danger is that voter who see him onstage begin to find it impossible to get past and therefore don’t judge him on his successes as president, his program for a second term or the comparison between him and Trump. Multiple Democrat have attested to Biden mental acuity since Thursday. “I have seen the president twice in the last two weeks,” Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” The California lawmaker added: “I have had a conversation with him. He’s completely mentally sharp when we were discussing the Middle East.” But when Biden allies are forced to talk about his age, they inevitably draw attention back to the biggest liability for a president who polls show is struggling to create enthusiasm among grassroots Democrat and who may have trouble in reunifying his 2020 coalition, especially when it comes to younger and minority voter. Many Democrat also believe Trump is getting a pass when it comes to age and mental sharpness. While Biden missteps get great attention, Trump speeches often degenerate into nonsensical reflections. He recently mixed up Haley and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And while his manic presentation style may look energetic and disguise his age in comparison with Biden, he’d also be an octogenarian in the White House if he wins a second term. Why the 2020 election lineup may be locked in The renewed focus on Biden age is likely to open another round of speculation about whether he could be replaced on the Democrat ticket. But barring some unforeseen health event or a late decision by Biden to fold his campaign, this is highly unlikely. For all the focus on the president’s liabilities, no younger Democrat, with the exception of his long-shot primary rival Rep. Dean Phillips , has emerged to challenge Biden, perhaps to avoid damaging their own political futures. Could the Democrat Party pick an alternative candidate at its summer convention? It’s unlikely. Biden controls the infrastructure of the party — his rejigging of the primary calendar to insulate himself from challenges is proof of that. There’s no sign any major party figure is willing to tell him to step aside or to organize any attempt to topple him. Any convention maneuvering would also follow months of primaries in which Democrat voter are likely to massively endorse Biden, so any attempt to topple him would fly in the face of the Democrat principles that Democrat say they are trying to preserve. Had Vice President Kamala Harris been a striking success, there would be more pressure on Biden to yield to a younger successor. But her approval ratings are very low. Haley, for instance, sees Harris as such a political liability that she warns voter they could vote for Biden and get Harris as president. The time for moving on from Trump has also passed. Despite his four indictments, the ex-president’s dominance over Haley and other rivals in early nominating contests has crushed the notion that if only he faced a one-on-one fight, he’d be defeated by anti-Trump forces in the party. So it’s hard to see any way out of the choice America appears not to want. While there are are stark policy differences between Biden and Trump, the 2024 election could still come down to voter picking between Biden perceived declining capabilities and Trump wild, anti-Democrat and autocratic instincts.","['biden', 'trump', 'offering', 'stark', 'glimpse', 'political', 'liabilities', 'many', 'americans', 'wishing', 'options', '2024', 'biden', '81', 'angrily',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/senate-democrats-biden-election-analysis/index.html,"For Senate Democrat, 2024 is the year of living dangerously. In this fall’s Senate elections, Democrat will be defending more seats in precarious political terrain than in any other election during the 2020s. That list of challenging elections this year includes the final three Senate seats Democrat hold in states that voted for Trump in 2020, and five more in states that Biden won by 3 percentage points or less. Meanwhile, Republican this year are not defending any Senate seats in states that voted against Trump in 2020, or preferred him by 3 points or less. That math underlines the stakes for Democrat in Biden improving his position in the key swing states by November. One of the most powerful trends of modern Senate elections is that it has become exceedingly difficult for candidates in either party to win seats in states that usually vote the other way for president. The Senate Democrat running in difficult electoral terrain might break that trend this fall. Yet if they can’t, Biden fate in November could determine control of the Senate not only in 2025, but for years thereafter. A strong recovery by Biden in which he wins most of the key swing states could position Democrat to remain competitive in the battle for Senate control through the remainder of this decade, even if they narrowly lose the majority in November. But if Biden loses most of the swing states, Democrat could fall into a Senate deficit too large to realistically overcome for years — especially because the party has so few plausible opportunities to flip seats now held by the GOP. “If the bottom were to drop out for Biden, Democrat could lose the Senate for a long time,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the political newsletter “Sabato’s Crystal Ball,” which is published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. That prospect has enormous implications not only for the passage of legislation but also for the composition of the federal courts, especially the SupremeCourt. Four of the SupremeCourt justices will be older than 70 by 2028. Even if Biden holds the White House in 2024, and a vacancy arises, a durable Republican Senate majority might refuse to fill any of those seats — just as then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did while Barack Obama was president in 2016. “You can imagine SupremeCourt seats going unfilled for years,” Kondik said. The default position for the Senate in the 21st century has been for small and fleeting majorities. In the 12 congressional sessions since 2001, one party or the other has reached 55 Senate seats only three times. By comparison, one party or the other won a majority of 55 or more Senate seats seven times in the 10 sessions from 1980 to 2000. Smaller majorities, not surprisingly, have proved more difficult to defend: In this century, control of the Senate has already flipped in the elections of 2002, 2006, 2014 and 2020. The principal reason the chamber has become so closely divided is the growing correlation between how states vote for president and how they vote for the Senate. That has limited the number of Senate seats each side can win absent unusual circumstances. Through the late 20th century, it was common for voter to split their tickets by electing senators from one party while voting for the presidential nominee of the other. After the 1984 election, for instance, Democrat still held about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for Ronald Reagan in both of his winning presidential campaigns. But now the alignment between presidential and Senate outcomes has become nearly complete. Heading into the 2024 election, Republican hold 47 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Trump in 2020. Democrat, in turn, hold 48 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Biden last time. This surface equivalence in the two parties’ position in the Senate, though, masks a deeper divergence that largely explains the risk to Democrat this year. While Biden and Trump each won 25 states in 2020, Biden won far more of them by very narrow margins. As a result, Senate Democrat are much more dependent than Republican on states that lean their way only slightly in the presidential contest. In 2020, Biden won three states by less than a single percentage point: Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. He won three others by less than 3 percentage points: Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan. Democrat now hold 11 of the 12 Senate seats from those six highly competitive states. Biden speaks during a campaign rally in Las Vegas on February 4, 2024. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images By contrast, among the 25 states that backed Trump, North Carolina — where Republican hold both Senate seats — was the only one Trump carried by less than 3 percentage points. Even extending the net to states Trump won by less than 5 percentage points brings in only Florida, where Republican also hold both Senate seats. This contrast creates a huge disparity between the parties. Democrat now hold 14 inherently vulnerable Senate seats: their three from the states Trump won in 2020, and their 11 in the states Biden won only narrowly. For Republican the total is at most six: two in states that Biden won in 2020, and four in states that Trump won narrowly, even with Florida included. “When you have so many states where it is now inconceivable that they could go the other way, Democrat always have to get a straight flush,” said Michael Podhorzer , the former political director for the AFL-CIO. “They’ve got to run the table, because on the basis of what’s safe on either side in the Senate, or the Electoral College, they are at a huge disadvantage.” This year Democrat are defending five of their 11 seats in the states that Biden won by 3 points or less. That’s the biggest concentration of seats from those states Democrat must defend in any single election in this decade, from 2020 through 2028. This year’s Senate races in the narrow Biden states include Democrat incumbents Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, and Jacky Rosen in Nevada; also on the ballot is an open Democrat-held seat in Michigan and the Arizona seat held by Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrat. Sinema hasn’t indicated whether she will seek reelection, but Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego is already running for the seat. In addition, Democrat this year must defend all three of their remaining Senate seats in the states that voted for Trump in 2020. That includes incumbents Jon Tester in Montana, Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and the open seat being vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin in West Virginia. Neither of the two remaining Senate Republican in states that Biden won last time are up this year; nor are either of the GOP senators from North Carolina, the state Trump won by his smallest margin. Both parties agree the open West Virginia seat is virtually guaranteed to flip to the GOP. Tester and Brown both have strong personal brands, but Biden is almost certain to lose their states, and possibly by substantial margins. If he does, Brown and Tester could survive only by breaking a nearly inviolate recent pattern in presidential election years. In 2016, for the first time ever, every Senate race was won by the same party that carried the presidential contest in that state. In 2020, every Senate race again followed the presidential outcome — except in Maine, where Collins won reelection despite Biden victory there. This pattern proved especially frustrating to Democrat, who raised enormous sums in 2020 for Senate candidates in Republican-leaning states such as Kentucky, SouthCarolina, Iowa, Kansas, Montana and Texas. Yet when Trump comfortably carried those states in November, all of those Democrat Senate candidates lost as well. A man vote on Election Day on November 3, 2020, in Charleston, SouthCarolina. Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images This year, with West Virginia likely already gone, if either Brown or Tester loses, it would be very difficult for Democrat to maintain their Senate majority into 2025. The only Republican senators they might plausibly oust to offset those losses are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas. Democrat have recruited strong challengers to each of them, but both of those races clearly lean toward the GOP, especially in a presidential election year. But if Democrat can hold down their Senate losses to some of their three seats in the states Trump won in 2020, they would emerge with a deficit small enough to overcome in upcoming elections. The real long-term risk for the party this November is losing several of their Senate seats in the states Biden narrowly carried last time. If Democrat lose Senate seats in the narrow Biden states, they simply have very few places on the map to replace them, given the parties’ patterns of support. It’s that prospect that has led the Democrat data analyst David Shor to warn for years that if the party doesn’t perform well in the 2024 presidential election, the GOP could seize control of the Senate for a sustained period. Shor would not comment on the Democrat’ Senate situation, but many other analysts see a dangerous convergence: The party must defend an unusually large number of seats in terrain that is highly contested at the presidential level precisely as Biden is struggling in polls against Trump. “There is a real downside risk that if the presidential election goes poorly, the Republican could not only win the Senate but build something of a cushion that would be hard for Democrat to cut into in the near future,” Kondik said. Gene Ulm, a Republican pollster who has worked for many Senate candidates, agrees that what happens in the narrow Biden 2020 states this fall will cast a huge shadow on control of the Senate through the decade. If Republican capture Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, he said, the reaction in the political world would not be “gosh, shock, alert the media,” he said. “It’s one thing for Republican to recapture those states that have been habitually red,” Ulm said, but “if all of a sudden you have Republican winning places that are historically purple,” that creates a very different situation going forward. The best-case scenario for Democrat is that Biden recovers enough to win most or all of the five battleground states where the party is also defending Senate seats. Many on both sides agree that it will be difficult for Republican to flip any of those Democrat-held seats if Biden wins the state — with Arizona a possible exception if Sinema creates a three-way race. Of the Democrat running in the narrow Biden states, Casey in Pennsylvania and Baldwin in Wisconsin are probably best positioned to win even the president he loses their state, many in both parties agree. Brown and Tester also have deep roots that could allow them to survive Biden defeats as well. But in this era of greater party-line voting, it won’t be easy for any candidate to overcome such an undertow: Hardly any Senate Democrat in competitive races ran even 2 percentage points ahead of Biden vote share in 2020. Ulm sees two keys to the Senate outcomes in the competitive swing states. One is the choices in the Senate races by voter who back third-party presidential candidates out of distaste for both Biden and Trump, assuming they face each other again; it is very difficult at this point, Ulm said, to predict how those disaffected voter will vote in Senate races. For Ulm, the other key question is what happens with the voter who are slightly negative about Biden. He is confident Republican Senate candidates will romp among voter who strongly disapprove of Biden, as they did in 2022. But one reason Democrat blunted the anticipated 2022 red wave is their congressional and gubernatorial candidates ran unusually well among voter who only “somewhat disapproved” of Biden — largely because many of those voter considered the Trump-allied GOP alternatives too extreme. Electoral workers process ballots in Easton, Pennsylvania, on November 3, 2020. Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images That risk to the GOP remains. “The soft disapprovers are going to be a much more competitive constituency, just like 2022,” Ulm said. David Bergstein, communications director for the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee, notes that in the 2022 midterm election, Democrat won Senate races in most of these same battleground states, although exit polls showed substantial discontent with the economy and Biden performance then, too. “Senate campaigns are candidate versus candidate battles,” Bergstein said. “We have the superior candidates, and Republican are putting forward candidates who have big flaws, who lost races before, or are facing the prospect of damaging primaries. Certainly a presidential cycle is different than a midterm, but the laws of Senate campaigns, where candidate quality matters, are still in effect.” Gary Jacobson, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of California at San Diego who specializes in Congress, said that given the fissures opening in each party’s coalition during the Trump era, no one should rule out the possibility that either side may develop new opportunities that reconfigure the Senate’s precarious balance. “This structural disadvantage the Democrat have is a real thing and it will make it an uphill battle for them to control the Senate for the foreseeable future,” Jacobson said. “But the foreseeable future is pretty short. Political configurations are not cut in stone.” Unless and until such a new political configuration emerges, both parties can realistically target many fewer Senate seats than they could even two decades ago. But the ceiling is clearly lower for Democrat than for Republican. It leaves Democrat, even in good years, with achingly little margin for error to build a Senate majority. And unless Biden recovers more strength, 2024 may be very far from anything Democrat would call a good year.","['senate', 'democrat', '2024', 'year', 'living', 'dangerously', 'fall’s', 'senate',

CNN — As the two-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, it feels like everyone has been sucked into a bizarro world. ► Two years ago, in February 2022, Tucker Carlson was a Fox News host, still adjacent to mainstream US politics. ► US support for Ukraine seemed ironclad and unflappable as Russia invaded. ► Russian President Vladimir Putin was about to be isolated worldwide as a pariah. ► Elon Musk would soon commit to helping Ukraine with his Starlink satellite internet system. ► Trump was still plotting his way out of the political wilderness, his presence rarely felt by most of the country. What a difference two years makes Some developments this week: ► Putin got a platform, thanks to a softball interview by Carlson, who was banished from Fox News last year and has turned to Twitter, the platform Musk bought and renamed X, to spew right-wing conspiracy theories. ► American aid for Ukraine is in real question as US politicians, led by Republican in the House of Representatives, question the investment. Note: When Trump helped kill a bipartisan border policy bill this week, it also put Ukraine aid sought for months by Biden in jeopardy. ► Trump emergence from the wilderness is complete. He has all but erased any question he will be the Republican presidential nominee for the third time and is plotting his return to the White House. The Pentagon, by the way, is now paying Musk’s SpaceX for Ukraine to use Starlink. Video Ad Feedback Russia expert says this is what Putin hoped to get from Carlson interview 02:06 - Source: CNN A propaganda broadcast on X Carlson was walked on by Putin during the interview in Moscow. CNN’s Oliver Darcy called it a “propaganda victory” for Putin. From Darcy: Instead of pressing Putin on the many topics at hand, including credible accusations Russia has committed war crimes and the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Carlson allowed the autocrat a free lane to manipulate the public and tell his version of history, no matter how deceptive it may have been. At times, between the airing of grievances, Putin appeared to school Carlson on historical events as the host looked on in bewilderment. Or to put it more plainly, Carlson provided Putin a platform to spread his propaganda to a global audience with little to no scrutiny of his claims. In one notable exchange, Carlson did push back on the idea that Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia since last March, is a US spy. According to CNN’s reporting, Russia rejected an offer to exchange a large number of Russian nationals detained abroad for both Gershkovich and another American, Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since 2018. Putin told Carlson that perhaps Gershkovich could be exchanged for Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel in Russia’s domestic spying service who was convicted for murdering a former Chechen fighter in Berlin in broad daylight in 2019. CNN’s Nathan Hodge, Katharina Krebs and Helen Regan have more details . They also fact-check Carlson on his assertion that US media organizations have not tried to interview Putin. From their report: In fact, journalists have repeatedly been requesting interviews with Putin, but the Russian president had declined to grant access. And Putin not only has declined to participate in interviews with the free press, but over the past two years he has waged a war against the media, locking up journalists , fining Big Tech companies for hosting “fake” information about the Ukraine invasion, and pushing through censorship laws that clamp down on news organizations. Video Ad Feedback Amanpour pushes back on Tucker Carlson's claim about Putin interview 02:13 - Source: CNN Putin, despite the free platform from Carlson, still faces isolation in the West. The CNN reporters note the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin regarding an alleged scheme to take Ukrainian children to Russia. And there was a new call Thursday for Putin to face a war crimes inquiry for Russia’s assault on the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which killed thousands. The reporters also used the word “revanchist,” which I had to look up and which perfectly describes Putin’s warped view of history and his obsession with occupying Ukraine. From Merriam-Webster: of or relating to a policy designed to recover lost territory or status. Shakeup in Ukraine Meantime, there are major developments in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky this week replaced his top military commander, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. From CNN’s report : The president’s move follows tensions between Zelensky and his hugely popular military chief after the failure of Ukraine’s much-vaunted counteroffensive, and with Ukraine facing a renewed Russian onslaught, manpower and ammunition shortages, and US aid stalled in Congress. Major choices for Americans But among the many, concrete choices Americans face in November, assuming the presidential election is between Trump and Biden, is how the US president will approach Putin. Biden has his built his presidency around the idea of a worldwide struggle between democracies and autocracies. Trump frequently expresses admiration for autocrats and his frustration with Democrat alliances like NATO. Ukraine funding has run dry The Pentagon has essentially exhausted the money Congress allocated for Ukraine over the past two years. It’s unclear when more might be on the way, particularly after the proposal to tie US border policy to Ukraine funding met its end this week. In the Senate, there is support for Ukraine aid. A bipartisan group of senators on Thursday cleared a 60-vote threshold to move toward a $95 billion aid bill for Ukraine and Israel. One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, plans to use arcane procedural tactics to stall a final vote for days . Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, pushed back against criticism from right-wing lawmakers that the money is charity for Ukraine. Most of the funds would be spent on production of military hardware in the US, he said. “This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy and demonstrating to our allies and adversaries alike that we’re serious about exercising American strength,” he said on the Senate floor on Friday. The House is a more formidable roadblock to additional Ukraine funding. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has not ruled out the idea of approving a Ukraine bill, either as a stand-alone proposition or in conjunction with aid to Israel. But he has certainly not endorsed it either. Johnson, along with other Republican, has demanded more transparency and accountability for how the money is spent. And to get more aid passed into law, he would likely need Democrat vote – which will anger hard-line Republican who have the power to oust him.","['version', 'appeared', 'cnn’s', 'matters',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/politics/biden-age-concerns-analysis/index.html,"A probe that spared Biden from criminal charges paradoxically dealt him a threatening political blow. Special counsel Robert Hur’s report released Thursday on Biden handling of classified documents effectively ended the matter. But his assertions that Biden was elderly and forgetful ignited a political firestorm that cut directly to the heart of the president’s chief vulnerability in the 2024 election. The White House knew it had a huge political problem on its hands. undefined — Biden speaks in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, Thursday, Feb. 8, 2024, in Washington. Evan Vucci/AP Related article Takeaways from special counsel’s report into Biden handling of classified documents After hours of Republican claims that the report showed he wasn’t capable of serving as president, Biden appeared at a hastily scheduled news conference Thursday evening, apparently seeking to turn the page on what turned into a disastrous day. “I know what the hell I am doing,” Biden fumed in the Diplomatic Room of the White House, as he defended his faculties and bristled with anger. Biden also pointed out that Hur’s report drew distinctions between his handling of classified material and Trump ’s allegedly criminal and obstructive conduct on the same issue over which the ex-president faces a future criminal trial. Biden appeared fired up and passionate. But at the same time, his angry demeanor and an event which appeared to quickly spin out of his control, with reporters shouting questions as he struggled to interrupt, may have ended up exacerbating the very questions about his age that it was meant to dispel. When CNN’s MJ Lee pointed out that many voter have questions about his age, Biden pointed his finger and forcibly said, “That’s your judgment.” Story highlights Biden's age and acuity matter to voter and he is under increasing pressure to address this and demonstrate his capacity as the general election approaches. Age is an issue that many families have to wrestle with and so understand intuitively, a factor that may be reflected in public opinion on the matter as it relates to the election. This is a delicate issue that has not been fully tackled either by the White House or the Biden campaign. The press event also raised new questions about his sharpness in a week in which he has twice confused the names of a serving and recent European leader with those with whom he interacted in the 1980s. At one point in his Thursday night appearance, Biden was referring to the president of Egypt in a comment about the Middle East crisis but mistakenly said “the president of Mexico.” This is the kind of mistake any overworked politician might make. And even when he was much younger, Biden had a reputation as a gaffe machine and for verbal slips. But in the context of Biden declaration that his “memory is fine” his political liability over his age and coming as it did during an event meant to demonstrate vitality and accurate recall, it was an unwelcome trip-up, to say the least. An emotional moment There was also a poignant moment where palpable grief came to the surface when the president condemned Hur for suggesting that in an interview he struggled to remember the date of his beloved son Beau’s death. It’s hard to think of a more painful thing for Biden to have to read since he remains deeply affected by his son’s passing from brain cancer in 2015. “How the hell dare he raise that?” Biden asked, before breaking off, apparently close to tears. Overall, Biden left an impression of a president who feels he’s been deeply wronged, is bitter about the way he is covered by the media and treated by Republican and still believes deeply he is the best option to beat Trump in November — an opponent that he views as an anti-Democrat anathema to everything America stands for. The president’s defenders often get frustrated when the political conversation is dominated by Biden age – rather than Trump repeated challenges to the rule of law. Biden speaks in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, Thursday, Feb. 8, 2024, in Washington. Evan Vucci/AP Related article Biden slams special counsel Hur for raising son Beau’s death But at the same time, his age and acuity really do matter to voter and he is under increasing pressure to address this and demonstrate his capacity as the general election approaches. Sure, Biden likely Republican opponent is a twice-impeached 77-year-old with a volcanic temperament who is facing 91 charges and tried to thwart US democracy three years ago. But Biden is the president now, and despite the preferred framing of his campaign that 2024 is a direct comparison between him and Trump, he will be judged on his own record and capability to serve as commander-in-chief for a full four years, especially as Vice President Kamala Harris has her own questions to answer about her experience, popularity and suitability to serve in the Oval Office. In a CNN/SSRS poll published in November, only 25% of Americans believed Biden had the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively, while 53% said Trump did. In another CNN poll last week, 46% of Democrat were concerned about Biden age. This is a delicate issue that has not been fully tackled either by the White House or the Biden campaign and is often rationalized away by Democrat and in Washington in a way that does not fully reflect the depth of feeling about it in the nation as a whole. The fact that Biden delivered his remarks on Thursday night shows that his team now recognizes the president has a significant liability in this area but his performance also suggests that he’s yet to fully work out how to put voter at ease. A painful issue Age and the question of diminished capacities as a person heads into their twilight years is a deeply painful and sensitive one. It’s something that many families have to wrestle with and so understand intuitively, a factor that may be reflected in public opinion on the matter as it relates to the election. Many of the attacks on Biden by Republican certainly reek of ageism and come across as cruel. As Biden knows however, politics is a nasty, personal business. In mitigation, he has kept up a rigorous schedule on the campaign trail in recent weeks traveling coast-to-coast and last year conducted several grueling foreign trips that would have tired a much younger man. But the pressures of the presidency are unrelenting and offer little time for true mental relief. This is underscored by the fact that Biden is for example dealing with two wars in Ukraine and Gaza that constantly threaten to spill out of control and embroil the world in a much wider conflict. Biden fans may also have a case that he’s being unfairly compared with Trump. The ex-president — despite a few recent glaring gaffes himself — notably mixing up his GOP rival Nikki Haley with ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — has not had the same scrutiny over age even though he’d be into his 80s by the end of his own second term if he wins in November. Trump often nonsensical remarks, verbal gaffes and frequently unhinged demeanor are often cited by Democrat and raise questions about his age and capacity. But Trump manic energy tends to dampen such questions among his supporters, although there are arguably great red flags about his fitness for office raised by his four looming criminal trials and his open autocratic tendencies and vows to use a second term to enact personal “retribution” against his political enemies. Hur’s report rebuked Biden for willfully retaining classified information, including top secret documents after he left the vice presidency. But he said no charges were called for because there was insufficient evidence of willful intent to prove guilt without reasonable doubt. He also also drew a distinction between Biden handling of classified material after documents were found at his home, his garage and in an office that he used and Trump hoarding of classified material at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Biden cooperated with his probe while Trump is alleged to have done the opposite, according to a criminal indictment that also accuses him of obstruction. The facts show that there are huge differences in the cases of Biden and Trump — even if the nuance will be blurred in the heat of a campaign as GOP leaders complain of double standards in the justice system. But the GOP’s real opening came when Hur suggested that Biden would come across to a jury as a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man “with a poor memory.” Hur suggested that he had frequent memory lapses during his interviews with investigators, including not being able to recall when Beau died or exactly when Biden was vice president. The special counsel also said the president could not remember details of a debate over Afghanistan that appeared very important to him. Biden lawyers lashed out at such details as inappropriate. Biden allies suggested that as Hur was appointed as a district attorney in Maryland by Trump he may have a political ax to grind. In private, the findings touched off a furious response from Biden, with the president angrily and profanely asking how anyone could believe he would forget the day his son died, CNN’s Kevin Liptak reported . Many of the Republican attacks on Biden were biting. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio suggested on Twitter for instance that he was suffering from dementia. North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis was kinder but his comments over Biden age were also cutting. “I’m not one who gets personal. But when it’s so profound, that you have a prosecutor take note of it, I think it’s something to pay attention to,” Tillis said. “I’m not trying to take a cheap shot. …  Let’s say that was the CEO of a company. What would their board of directors be asking for this evening?” The reality of an unprecedented election Democrat moved quickly to dismiss concerns about Biden. “In my interactions with the president, which I have regularly, I’ve not experienced anything like that,” said Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. “When I came back from Ukraine the last time, I spent a good amount of time with him on the phone, talking about Ukraine and the details, and he was sharp.” But the fact Democrat even have to address this, points to Biden big political problem. And the entire situation is replete with irony. Biden acted aggressively Thursday to try to prevent a report that lifted the threat of criminal prosecution from him but already appears to have damaged him politically because of questions about his age. Trump meanwhile is facing four criminal trials that paradoxically appear to have benefitted him politically — at least with his deeply loyal base which has bought into his claims that he’s a victim of political persecution. That may not seem fair. But for Biden, it comes with being an incumbent president in his 80s who is facing genuine questions from the public about his capacity to serve. This also reflects the sometimes warped reality of politics in the age of Trump and an unprecedented election between two elderly likely opponents in November, each of whom have served an Oval Office term and have defied the efforts of a younger generation to succeed them.","['probe', 'spared', 'biden', 'criminal', 'charges', 'paradoxically', 'dealt', 'threatening', 'political', 'blow', 'special',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/politics/donald-trump-supreme-court-2024-analysis/index.html,"Few critical US Democrat institutions have escaped unsullied from a tangle with Trump . Now, the US SupremeCourt faces its greatest test so far from the former president. Photo illustration by Will Mullery/CNN/Getty Images Related article Your questions about the SupremeCourt and Trump, answered On Thursday, the nine justices will hear a case with critical implications for the 2024 election – over the Colorado SupremeCourt’s decision to remove Trump from the ballot over the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist” clause . By early next week, the SupremeCourt may also be considering whether to hear another Trump appeal, against a lower court decision to reject his demand for absolute presidential immunity over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election following his false claims of voter fraud. The pair of hugely significant and politically charged cases could thrust the justices deeper into a presidential election than at any time since the court decided the disputed 2000 election in favor of then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush over then-Vice President Al Gore. The historic reverberations from its new venture into campaign politics may echo even longer than the case that ended a bitter post-election period a quarter of a century ago. And given Trump habitual refusal to accept the rules and results of elections, no one would be surprised if the court is dragged deeper into the partisan fray before or after November’s presidential election, presuming Trump becomes the Republican nominee. Story highlights The pair of hugely significant and politically charged cases could thrust the justices deeper into a presidential election than at any time since the court decided the disputed 2000 election. Trump repeatedly sets out to lean on or discredit institutions that can hold him accountable, restrain his power or contradict his incessantly spun alternative realities. The perception that law enforcement has overreached against Trump has only solidified his supporters’ sympathy for him. The idea that the SupremeCourt is above politics has long been rather quaint given generations of sensitive decisions on politicized issues, including slavery, voting rights, civil rights, desegregation, interracial and same-sex marriage, health care and recently abortion. But no modern president has gone further than Trump in daring to shatter the notion that judges are obligated to pursue a higher calling than partisan politics – preserving the rule of law. The four-times criminally indicted Trump repeatedly sets out to lean on or discredit institutions that can hold him accountable, restrain his power or contradict his incessantly spun alternative realities. He draws them into his vitriol and falsehoods in a way that has harmed their purported reputations for being above the fray. When he loses an election, he claims it’s rigged; when the press reports the truth, he blasts the “fake news”; when he’s investigated, he claims it’s a witch hunt; when he’s indicted, he warns the grand jury is biased; when he loses a case, he condemns the entire court system as corrupt. The mantra of victimization is now at the center of a presidential campaign based on the perception that he’s being politically persecuted and is driving his determination to dedicate a second term to retribution. How Trump works the refs Even though Trump is not expected to attend Thursday’s oral arguments at the SupremeCourt, the justices know what’s coming. The 14th Amendment was passed by Congress June 13, 1866, and ratified July 9, 1868. National Archives Related article What to know about Trump and the 14th Amendment’s ‘insurrectionist ban’ During his high-profile trials, the ex-president has worked relentlessly to discredit the legitimacy of courts and judges. In his civil fraud trial in NewYork, for instance, he frequently clashed with the judge, and lambasted him, his staff and the case in regular breaks outside the court room. Trump last month stormed out of a trial over a defamation case brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll — shortly before a jury awarded her a stunning $83 million victory. After an appeals court in Washington, DC, this week rejected Trump extraordinary and anti-constitutional claims of total immunity over his attempts to overthrow the 2020 election, the former president’s eldest son, Trump Jr., attacked the legitimacy of the judges who ruled unanimously. “No one who’s been watching is shocked by this partisan hackery but here we go,” he wrote on X. “Time for SCOTUS to step in.” In several of the cases that the elder Trump is involved in, judges have imposed gag orders to protect the integrity of the proceedings. The ex-president’s power over his supporters is such that millions of them readily accept his falsehoods, coming to believe key institutions of government are corrupt. That leaves America’s political system and the rule of law more compromised than before. The result is that many voter, at least in his political base, discount the gravity of Trump alleged offenses. Video Ad Feedback 'That's leadership': Iowa voter react to Trump's comment on being a dictator 01:16 - Source: CNN According to a CNN poll conducted late last month, 49% of Republican say Trump did nothing wrong following the last presidential election. While 40% said his actions were unethical, just 11% said that they were illegal. Many of Trump voter believe they have been let down by the government or have lost faith in institutions, authority figures and experts. Trump success in portraying his legal travails as one huge conspiracy plays into these feelings and threatens to inflict long-term damage on the country’s Democrat institutions. A legal system that is regarded as bent and biased cannot long retain the confidence of its citizens. The perception that law enforcement has overreached against Trump has only solidified his supporters’ sympathy for him. The prospect of being dragged into the hyper-politicized arena of a presidential election is a nightmare enough for Chief Justice John Roberts , who has often sought to guard the high court against reputational damage from the country’s raging politics. Kenneth Fowler/CNN Related article ‘Judged by history’: Trump 14th Amendment fight at SupremeCourt poses an enormous test for John Roberts But an election case involving Trump, in a time of far greater partisan fury than the bitter aftermath of the 2000 election, could be an even graver matter – especially if any of the court’s rulings eventually go against Trump. The former president doesn’t play by the same moral codes as Gore, who gracefully swallowed his anger and accepted his electoral loss after the ruling in Bush v. Gore. In the past, the high court’s adverse rulings against Trump have been greeted with sharp criticism from the former president. He has also suggested that the failure of the three justices he nominated – Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – to do what he wants is a symptom of disloyalty. That attitude underscores Trump transactional nature and his obliviousness to the duty of judges to the law. “I’m not happy with the SupremeCourt. They love to rule against me. I picked three people. I fought like hell for them,” Trump said in his notorious January 6, 2021, speech in Washington that proceeded the mob attack on the US Capitol – which is at the root of both of the cases swirling around the president that the court is expected to face. “It almost seems that they’re all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country. To hurt our country,” Trump went on, referring to the justices. Video Ad Feedback 14th Amendment case: How we got here 02:54 - Source: CNN Trump echoed those remarks ahead of the Iowa caucuses last month, as he opened an effort to work the referees – or the conservative justices on the SupremeCourt – with regard to the Colorado case. He claimed that judges appointed by Democrat presidents were brazenly partisan and moaned that those picked by Republican presidents didn’t follow suit. “When you are a Republican judge, and you have been appointed by, let’s say Trump, they go out of their way to hurt you, so that they can show that they have been fair, fair, honorable people. It’s an amazing difference.” Trump went on, “It’s a different wiring system or something – but all I want is fair, I fought really hard to get really three very, very good people … I just hope that they are going to be fair because the other side plays the ref.” How Trump leans on judges Any judge that delivers verdicts contradictory to Trump view risks becoming a target. Video Ad Feedback Trump posts 'Thanksgiving message' at 2 a.m. with a list of insults 01:30 - Source: CNN The former president’s attack on a district judge that ruled against the Trump administration in an asylum case prompted Roberts in 2019 to try to insulate the judiciary from politics. “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” Roberts wrote in an extraordinary statement that did not name Trump, but clearly had him in mind. “What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.” Ever since, including in several cases in which the justices declined to hear or rejected Trump allegations about the 2020 election, he has had a tense relationship with the high court. CNN’s senior SupremeCourt analyst Joan Biskupic reported in her book “Nine Black Robes” that Roberts became increasingly skeptical of policies from a Trump administration that repeatedly stretched the limits of the law. For instance, Biskupic wrote that Roberts switched his vote to seal a 5-4 ruling against Trump plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form. And Biskupic also pointed out how Roberts quietly brokered strong majorities against Trump attempts to keep his personal tax and other financial records from the Manhattan district attorney and, separately, committees of the US House of Representatives. After Trump presidency, he and the high court were again at odds. The justices blocked Trump bid to stop the release of presidential records to a House committee investigating the January 6 attack, for instance. None of these cases will bear on how the court rules in the Colorado case, and if it decides whether to take up Trump likely appeal on the immunity matter. But history shows that however the court rules, Trump response will be filtered through his highly developed sense of injustice and suspicion of institutions of accountability and his often self-serving interpretation of the law.","['critical', 'us', 'democrat', 'institutions', 'escaped', 'unsullied', 'tangle', 'trump', 'us', 'supremecourt', 'faces', 'greatest', 'test', 'far',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/05/politics/presidency-trump-eligible-trials-court/index.html,"Critical days are ahead in Trump multiple legal battles. Imminent rulings and looming trials could prove fateful to the Republican frontrunner’s 2024 campaign and his personal fortune. The powers and the limits of the presidency, and even America’s constitutional democracy, will be shaped by what happens next. Amy O'Kruk, CNN Related card Tracking Trump indictments The collision between November’s presidential election and Trump extraordinary tangle of legal liabilities, trials, court appeals and tests of the rule of law is deepening as he tightens his grip on the Republican nomination. Several civil cases are moving toward their conclusions, with painful financial consequences for the ex-president. But there are growing signs that his delaying strategy, designed to postpone full accountability until after the election, could be working on several criminal fronts. And the nation’s top judges and justices are now wrestling with the consequences of Trump attempts to strain the guardrails of the political system to their limits. The resulting precedents will echo for as long as America remains a republic. Story highlights There are growing signs that Trump's delaying strategy, designed to postpone full accountability until after the election, could be working on several criminal fronts. The ex-president’s continued viability despite the depth of trouble facing him is testimony to his extraordinary transformation of the GOP. Trump advocacy for powers that all previous presidents did not have represents a direct challenge to America’s founding ideals. Trump, his lawyers, his political opponents and constitutional scholars are braced for huge looming developments. — On Thursday, the SupremeCourt will hear oral arguments over a decision by the Colorado SupremeCourt to throw Trump off the ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists. This follows the mob attack by his supporters on January 6, 2021, incited by his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020. The case has profound importance to the 2024 election and for how future elections will unfold. The SupremeCourt had little choice but to step in because differing legal rulings between several states threaten to cause national electoral chaos over Trump eligibility on state ballots. Maine has taken a similar step to Colorado but that case hasn’t yet reached the US SupremeCourt. The Colorado case was initially seen as a long shot to go against Trump, but a flurry of briefs to the SupremeCourt from historians and legal scholars show that it will not be easy for the justices to punt with a novel ruling that dismisses the issue out of hand. Key are whether the Civil War-era amendment applies to presidents and whether it is self-executing or would require a court or Congress to rule on insurrection adjudications. Trump supporters are using the case to rebut his critics’ claims that he’s a threat to democracy, arguing that throwing him off the ballot is a direct affront to voter and an example of election interference. — Another huge constitutional question is in limbo pending a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, DC, into Trump sweeping claims of presidential immunity , which he argues shields him from prosecution over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. The ruling could decide whether special counsel Jack Smith’s federal election interference case goes ahead before the election. More broadly, Trump calls for unlimited presidential power have huge implications for how he might behave in a second term and transform the reach of the presidency itself. — Trump is braced for a ruling in a civil fraud trial in NewYork targeting himself, his adult sons and the Trump Organization. Judge Arthur Engoron has already said that repeated fraud took place. His final ruling, expected within days, centers on issues including how much Trump will have to pay for ill-gotten gains and whether he will be barred from doing business in the state where he made his name. A judgment that runs into several hundred million dollars could put significant strain on Trump cash reserves and wealth. — Trump is still absorbing the consequences of a jury award late last month of $83 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of defamation after a judge ruled he was liable for sexual assault. Trump is putting together a new legal team to fight an appeal but many legal experts believe his chances of overturning the verdict after a trial in which he disparaged the court are slim. And the verdict is a financial hit that could multiply the pain of a big award against him in the fraud trial. — There are increasing signs that the first of four criminal trials Trump is due to face could be over an alleged attempt to mislead voter in the 2016 election in regard to a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. The case, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg , is seen by many legal experts as the least grave of the criminal threats facing Trump and could therefore play into his political claims that he’s being persecuted for political reasons — a narrative that could also shape the outcome of other criminal trials. — In Georgia, the racketeering case alleging Trump tried to steal the 2020 election in a critical swing state brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is now overshadowed by revelations about her personal relationship with her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade. Willis and Wade last week strongly rejected claims she financially benefited from hiring him. Willis also argued that “salacious” allegations should not disqualify her from leading the prosecution. Trump has seized on the drama to allege corruption and to demand the case be thrown out. If Willis is dislodged, there may be questions over whether another prosecutor would pursue the indictments in the same way, if at all. — Another federal trial against Trump, over his alleged mishandling of classified documents and obstruction at his Mar-a-Lago resort, has been nominally set for May. But it is unclear whether it will go ahead, with Smith and Trump lawyers mired in discovery disputes, including over the use of classified material in the case and whether the Department of Justice properly followed procedures in recovering secret material during Trump post-presidency. Trump cases represent an unprecedented national crisis The magnitude of simultaneous cases facing Trump is exceptional for any criminal defendant; their momentous nature and the fact that they are hanging over the most likely GOP nominee for president make this a perilous time for the country. Given the swirl of controversy that always rages around the ex-president and the daily drumbeat of court cases proceeding at a gradual pace, it’s often easy to overlook the astonishing reality of the moment and the implications it has for the coming election and beyond. The ex-president’s continued viability despite the depth of trouble facing him is testimony to his extraordinary transformation of the GOP. It also speaks to his skill at deflecting his own peril in a narrative of political persecution that has only bound his faithful supporters tighter to his “Make America Great Again” movement. Trump ability to defer accountability with legal delaying tactics and to demagogue judgments against him will now help decide whether he can pull off the more complicated mission of diminishing the impact of his trials among general election voter in November. Video Ad Feedback Legal analyst predicts how SupremeCourt will approach Trump's Colorado ballot ban appeal 01:20 - Source: CNN Trump last remaining GOP rival, former SouthCarolina Gov. Nikki Haley, is now arguing that Trump legal entanglements make him a disastrous pick for her party by seizing on the news that he spent more than $50 million from political action committees on legal fees. Haley told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that it was a “problem” that Trump will spend more time in a courtroom than in campaigning this year. “I think that the American people deserve to know which of these cases are legitimate and which ones aren’t,” Haley said. “We have got a country in disarray and a world on fire. We need a president that’s going to give us eight years of focus and discipline, not one that’s going to be sitting there ranting about how he’s a victim.” The lesson of the GOP primary so far, however, is that most Republican voter have no interest in disqualifying Trump after being convinced of his claims of a “witch-hunt.” The chances of the country getting full accountability over Trump legal challenges — at least before the election — appear to be receding. For instance, after initially hinting at swift action, a three-judge panel on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is yet to deliver a verdict, despite registering skepticism at a hearing last month over Trump immunity claims. This helps Trump because it delays the underlying federal election trial in the short term and builds in more of a buffer that his team could exploit by taking the maximum allowable time to mount a likely appeal to the SupremeCourt. At some point, either Judge Tanya Chutkan’s calendar may fill up or she may decide that the immediate proximity of the election means the trial will have to wait. On Friday, she postponed the trial’s original March 4 start date indefinitely. While that move was a boost to Trump, Chutkan may also have been seeking to apply pressure on the appeals court judges for a ruling, Ryan Goodman, a former special counsel to the Department of Defense, told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “So we might still see a ruling from the DC Circuit then the SupremeCourt decides whether or not it wants to act, and then everything could be put back on track. So, definitely a good day for Trump, but not necessarily out of the woods,” Goodman said. How Trump stretches the legal system and what it says about a possible second term There is a common thread through all of Trump clashes with the legal system that applies to his personal conduct and his political behavior and aspirations: an unwillingness to submit to the rules that constrain every other American. In his civil fraud trial and in the Carroll defamation case, Trump frequently behaved with disregard toward the courts and their officers. He staged tantrums and walkouts that showed the contempt with which he views the legal system. Video Ad Feedback CNN legal analyst says this is a 'bull's-eye' for prosecutors in Mar-a-Lago case 01:40 - Source: CNN In his immunity case, he’s demanding all but absolute power as president — both to get him off the hook for seeking to overturn the 2020 election and apparently as a foundation for what he is promising would be a second term dedicated to “retribution,” which he’d like to conduct with a guarantee that he’d be uninhibited by the Constitution and the law. For instance, at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, last month, Trump argued “you’re going to have to allow a president — any president — to have immunity so that that president can act and do what he feels and what his group of advisers feel is the absolute right thing.” He added: “Otherwise, you’re going to have presidents that are totally impotent and we’ve had enough of them already.” Trump advocacy for powers that all previous presidents did not have represents a direct challenge to America’s founding ideals since the country was born on the rejection of an unassailable executive authority figure — a British king — with unaccountable power. The ex-president’s power grabs in light of his assault on the 2020 election in a bid to remain in power are prompting Biden to anchor his campaign in a fight to save democracy. “This is not just a campaign. This is more of a mission, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot lose this campaign, for the good of the country,” he told campaign workers in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday. With his legal maneuverings, Trump is showing that he also understands the implications of this election — one that could give him substantial powers as president to defray or dismiss many of the legal threats that he’s facing and to behave in office without future accountability.","['critical', 'days', 'ahead', 'trump', 'multiple', 'legal', 'battles', 'imminent', 'rulings', 'looming',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/07/politics/democrats-biden-election-polling/index.html,"The political eyes of the world are on Nevada this week for the state’s Democrat and Republican nominating contests. Former SouthCarolina Gov. Nikki Haley suffered an embarrassing defeat in the state’s nonbinding GOP primary Tuesday. But in the contests that award delegates, Biden easily won the Democrat primary while former Trump is expected to coast Thursday in the GOP caucuses. That lack of competitiveness belies the fact that Nevada has seen some of the closest general election outcomes in the past two presidential contests. Perhaps that’s why Democrat should be concerned that Trump has led Biden in recent polling from the Silver State. And Nevada is emblematic of a nationwide trend . Biden finds himself in a place no likely Democrat presidential nominee has been since 2004: clearly trailing for months on end. Story highlights Biden finds himself in a place no likely Democrat presidential nominee has been since 2004: clearly trailing for months on end. Biden was never behind Trump during the 2020 campaign, and not just in the polling average. He didn’t trail Trump in a single national poll that met CNN standards for publication. The root of Biden problem is that he’s unpopular with the general electorate. Much was made this past weekend of an NBC News poll that put Trump at 47% to Biden 42% in a hypothetical general election. What stood out to me is that it was merely one of three polls released in the past week that gave Trump a 4- or 5-point advantage among registered voter. Even when those findings are averaged with a Quinnipiac University poll from last week that had Biden ahead by 6 points, Trump is up by about 2 points. This is a lead that has been fairly steady over the past six months. The occasional poll, like Quinnipiac’s, will find Biden up, but the lion’s share of the data points to Trump in the lead. Biden speaks at an event in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on January 12, 2024. Evan Vucci/AP Related article Biden best path to reelection runs through the Great Lakes and not the Sun Belt This is a far different situation for Democrat compared with the past few cycles. Biden was never behind Trump during the 2020 campaign, and not just in the polling average . He didn’t trail Trump in a single national poll that met CNN standards for publication. Going back further, Trump led only once, for a short period, in the 2016 average. That was after the 2016 Republican convention. Likewise, in the 2012 cycle , Republican Mitt Romney may have been ahead very shortly after the first GOP debate, but, in reality, President Barack Obama led wire to wire. Obama was also up for pretty much the entire general election campaign over Republican John McCain in 2008 , except for briefly after the GOP convention. President George W. Bush in 2004 was the last Republican to be consistently ahead of his Democrat opponent. That race against Democrat John Kerry would shift a bit during the summer of 2004 before Bush solidified his advantage after the Republican convention. This year, however, is far different from 2004 insofar as Bush was the incumbent then like Biden is now. Incumbents are usually never behind in early polling. Trump was in 2020. Before him? Almost no one since the advent of modern polling. Incumbents who briefly trailed at some early point in the campaign had regained their leads by this time. Incumbents who would trail for much of the campaign were still ahead at this point in the cycle. Even Harry Truman and Thomas Dewey were trading leads in the early part of the 1948 cycle before Dewey settled into a polling lead for good and then lost in an upset . The root of Biden problem is that he’s unpopular with the general electorate. His approval rating has been hovering within a few points of 40% for more than two years now , and it’s not getting any better for him. Biden has the worst approval rating at this point for any elected president through their first term. This should worry Democrat because we’re getting to the point where current approval ratings have some correlation with approval ratings by election time. Every day that Biden approval rating is bad increases the chance that his approval rating will be bad when people start voting this fall. What often changes the most between now and the general election is the popularity of lesser-known candidates. Trump speaks at a primary election night party in Nashua, New Hampshire, on January 23, 2024. Matt Rourke/AP Related article New Hampshire proves how historically strong Trump is Trump is an exception to this rule. He has near-universal name identification like Biden. Voters know Trump; they don’t like Trump; and yet, they seem to prefer him to Biden. This would seemingly make it more difficult for Biden to influence the race to his benefit through attack ads. Biden issues also aren’t just candidate-specific. Recent Gallup polling showed a record low level of adults self-identifying as Democrat in 2023. Just 27% of adults identified as Democrat, which is the lowest figure for Democrat since at least 1988. The good news for Biden is that he’s not far behind. The average 2-point edge that Trump sports wouldn’t be considered safe if it holds through Election Day. We’re still nearly nine months away from the fall election. Trump is still facing four criminal indictments, which is something we don’t have any historical precedent for. The bad news for Biden is that the precedent we do have is not promising: Incumbents hoping to win reelection aren’t usually trailing at this point in a presidential campaign, and Biden continues to be fundamentally unpopular.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/07/politics/supreme-court-trump-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — There is a dizzying array of court cases related to former Trump. Only one is headed to the US SupremeCourt this week. It is a Colorado case in which Trump was declared ineligible for the state’s 2024 ballot for violating the Civil War-era insurrection clause in the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution. When we asked CNN readers for their questions about the SupremeCourt case, it quickly became clear in the hundreds of responses that a lot of people are struggling to keep all of Trump legal issues separate. For instance, the SupremeCourt will hear oral arguments Thursday in the 14th Amendment case – the same week that an appeals court in Washington, DC, clarified that, no, Trump does not enjoy “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution for his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election. For an excellent, shorter version of what might happen at the court this week, listen to this “One Thing” podcast with CNN’s SupremeCourt expert Joan Biskupic . In answering readers’ questions below, we’ve tried to delineate between the multiple cases involving Trump. We’ve also edited the wording in some questions for grammar and style. Can Trump be prevented from being on all election ballots in 2024? Dave in Texas The case SupremeCourt justices are hearing on Thursday has to do with a finding in Colorado’s court system that Trump engaged in insurrection and a decision by the state SupremeCourt that he should be removed from the ballot. The state courts stayed that decision until the US SupremeCourt weighs in. What comes next is very much in the hands of the US SupremeCourt, and there are many possible outcomes. Will justices affirm or overturn the decision by Colorado’s SupremeCourt? Will the US SupremeCourt weigh in on whether Trump engaged in insurrection? If justices allow Trump to be excluded from the Colorado ballot, will it endanger his status in other states? There is no requirement that the same names appear on every presidential ballot in the country, and in fact, the ballots vary from state to state. If you are indicted, are you presumed innocent? If a person has not been found guilty, how can they be barred from an election? Peter in Florida Yes, anyone facing criminal prosecution, including Trump, is presumed innocent. But the question currently before the SupremeCourt about whether he violated the insurrectionist clause in the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal charges he faces in state and federal courts. In the 14th Amendment case , which was brought by a group of Republican and independent voter in Colorado, a state judge found, after hearing evidence, that Trump “engaged in insurrection.” The Colorado SupremeCourt later ruled, by a slim majority, that he was ineligible to be on the state’s ballot. Now the US SupremeCourt gets to weigh in. Of course, Trump is facing four different criminal trials – and two of them, in state court in Georgia and federal court in Washington, DC, have to do with his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But he is not currently charged in any court with the specific crime of inciting insurrection or rebellion. Could the SupremeCourt endanger other aspects of the 14th Amendment, such as birthright citizenship, if it interpreted the insurrection clause as only relevant to a specific historical period, like the aftermath of the Civil War, thus potentially excluding its application to modern contexts, such as the protection of freedom of speech and the right to protest? James in NewYork This is a thoughtful question. Trump, for instance, has said that if he is reelected he will work to end birthright citizenship, even though it is guaranteed in the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment also has important clauses having to do with the drawing of congressional districts – a subject on which the SupremeCourt frequently gets involved – and the public debt, which has grown exponentially. It is possible that the people who try to influence US policy by maneuvering cases toward the SupremeCourt could try to exploit a decision for their own purposes. But it would be the height of irony for conservative justices who claim to be “originalist” interpreters of the Constitution, particularly in terms of the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms, to stray from originalism in the case of the 14th Amendment. Can Trump actually be convicted of a felony and still be elected as our president? One cannot be in the military if convicted of a felony, so how could this be possible? Robin in NewYork We get this question a lot. The answer is yes. There is nothing in the Constitution about a convict being unqualified to serve. There are only three requirements. A candidate must be: A natural born citizen. At least 35 years old. A resident of the US for at least 14 years. It is an important thing for voter to be able to choose from the candidates they desire and for the system to protect against frivolous criminal prosecutions aimed at disqualifying political opponents. The efforts to try Trump in criminal court, which have dragged on for years, have been anything but frivolous. But again, the SupremeCourt this week is not considering anything to do with Trump criminal prosecutions. This case is specifically focused on the finding that he engaged in insurrection and his ability to appear on the ballot in Colorado. Do you really believe the SupremeCourt will rule against Trump? Really you should remember who appointed them. They have lost my trust in the judicial system. Gerald It is true that Trump appointed three of the nine SupremeCourt’s associate justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. It is also true that this SupremeCourt did not intervene to help him keep the White House in 2020. Without any public dissents, they rejected his bid to block millions of vote for Biden in battleground states. What are the chances that Trump is banned from the ballot and jailed for his part in the insurrection? Becky in Ohio These are separate questions. Trump ballot eligibility in Colorado is before the nine SupremeCourt justices. While he has not been charged in criminal court specifically with the crime of insurrection, he does face four separate criminal trials, two of which are focused on his 2020 election interference. In those cases, which will be decided by juries of Trump peers, he could theoretically face jail time if convicted. What recourse does the American citizen have when SCOTUS rules against the meaning of law? Or, cowardly punts the decision to the states or Congress? Rebecca Vote. SupremeCourt justices are appointed by presidents and confirmed by senators. If you don’t like the makeup of the court, the only current way to change it is to vote for lawmakers you agree with and then wait for them to act. That’s an unsatisfying answer since justices can sit on the bench for decades. There are efforts to change the court to spark more frequent turnover, but they currently lack momentum. To the second part of this question, the court can essentially make law with its decisions, so they are reinterpreting rather than ruling against it. To that point, if, as a voter, you’d rather have more input on laws, it is a feature and not a flaw when the court punts decisions back to lawmakers. Trump lawyers say because the 14th Amendment doesn’t specifically say ‘president’ that it doesn’t pertain to Trump. It does say that anyone holding office that has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution cannot hold office if they participate in insurrection. The presidency is the highest office in the USA. This has to make him accountable. Am l correct? Eldon This is the question on which the entire 14th Amendment case may hinge. The original Colorado judge who ruled Trump did engage in insurrection did not remove Trump from the ballot. She was convinced by his lawyers’ argument that the presidency is not covered by the insurrection clause because it does not specifically list the president as an “officer” of the US. The Colorado SupremeCourt took the opposite view. Read its opinion , which examines, in great detail, all of the arguments about whether the president is an officer of the US government and concludes that obviously he or she is. It’s not exactly pertinent to this case, but an appeals court that determined Trump is not immune from prosecution notably referred to the president as an “officer.” Here’s exactly what the 14th Amendment says : No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. If those who make policy and laws are voted into office – such as members of Congress – why don’t SupremeCourt justices have to get elected? Their jobs are far more important in the grand scheme since they can just rule a law the other party voted for as unconstitutional. Matthew in Washington It’s a wonky system. SupremeCourt justices are supposed to be insulated from politics and independent from the two elected branches of government. This independence, according to Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, was important to guard the Constitution and individual rights from “ ill humors ” of the public. In reality, most SupremeCourt justices come from very political backgrounds, and they are appointed by presidents who hope they will sway to a political side. Their power is supposed to be balanced by the other two branches; they are appointed by the executive, and the legislative branch sets the makeup of the courts and can, if needed, remove judges from office. If the SupremeCourt decides to weigh in on the presidential immunity issue, and he wins the election before they make their decision, what could happen? Cheryl-Anne This is a separate question than the 14th Amendment ballot issue the SupremeCourt is considering this week. The court specifically declined to take up the question of Trump immunity from criminal prosecution so that an appeals court in Washington, DC, could hear that case. That three-judge appeals court panel decided this week that Trump is not immune from prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election. The SupremeCourt could now decide to also consider the immunity question, but it’s not at all clear that it will. It’s also not clear what might happen if Trump is convicted and then elected. He could try to pardon himself, despite the obvious moral hazard of doing so. If he’s elected before a conviction, he could try to get the Department of Justice to drop the case. It would be unprecedented territory. Should Clarence Thomas recuse himself in the Trump case because of his wife’s actions? Linda in Virginia For reference, Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a conservative activist and was involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. She has testified she did not discuss the election with her husband. Whether or not her activism means Clarence Thomas should recuse himself from election-related cases is up for debate. There are no hard rules related to SupremeCourt justices recusing themselves from cases. What is abundantly clear is that Clarence Thomas probably won’t be recusing himself from Trump-related matters. Why has no one stated that judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, should be removed from overseeing a court involving Trump? She has made judgments in favor of Trump defense on motions that the prosecution has not even filed for the court to review. Judge Cannon is violating her oath to be unbiased and impartial while acting as a sitting judge. Keith This question pertains to one of the four criminal cases – the one being prosecuted in federal court in Florida and in which the government says Trump mishandled classified data and conspired to cover it up. It is true that Cannon was appointed by Trump, but so was one-third of the US SupremeCourt. Judges appointed by both Barack Obama and Biden have also heard matters related to Trump and election interference. That’s the way the judicial system works. If the timing is such that Trump gets elected and then is later convicted of federal crimes, what happens? Can Congress take impeachment action on that? What is involved? Or is he untouchable as chief exec? Worse, can he be actual president while in prison? Can he be placed in prison by a court after being elected president? Biff The general thinking is that Trump would find a way to throw out federal prosecutions if they are not concluded before he takes office, assuming he is reelected. The Department of Justice has a long-standing custom of not taking legal action against a sitting president. But that policy does not apply to state courts, and he is facing two criminal prosecutions in state courts in Georgia and NewYork. Congress could always move to impeach him, but that would only be a realistic possibility if Democrat took control of the House. I’m trying to imagine an election in which Trump won the White House and Democrat won the House. It’s not impossible! But maybe unlikely. Plus, any majority on Capitol Hill is likely to be small, and multiple Republican vote would be required to convict him in the Senate, which at the moment also seems unlikely. We would be deep into uncharted territory if Trump was to be convicted and then win reelection. Nobody really knows what would be involved. If the US SupremeCourt decides he can be excluded from ballots, could enough people ‘write his name in?’ How will those vote actually be counted in districts, and more importantly, will those vote actually supersede the fact that he isn’t actually on the ballot and count? Grady in North Carolina Trump name is already printed on primary ballots in Colorado. If the SupremeCourt rules he can be kept off the ballot before the primary on March 5, the state Secretary of State has said that vote for him would not count. As for write-ins, the case is ultimately about his eligibility to serve as president. If the court rules he’s ineligible, write-ins probably would not matter. But that would have to be determined. Why isn’t Trump trial being televised? Or the upcoming SupremeCourt hearing? The people need to see what is really happening – the good and the bad. Ilda in Texas Federal courts do not allow television cameras, which I’ve argued is a mistake . That said, there will be live audio of the SupremeCourt oral arguments Thursday. That’s a step in the right direction. Is there the possibility the SupremeCourt narrowly decides that states cannot dictate who a party chooses as its candidate based on freedom of speech and assembly and not make a decision on whether a state can remove a candidate from the general election ballot? Jeffrey Anything is possible for the SupremeCourt. Justices frequently find creative ways to decide the outcome of cases without deciding core issues in them. See Bush v. Gore, which decided the 2000 presidential election by stopping a recount in Florida. The scenario you describe would, I believe, allow Trump to be on the ballot while sidestepping the issue of whether he engaged in insurrection. That would not be shocking. If Trump is unable to run for president for ANY reason, who will the Republican back as their candidate? Bill in Virginia We don’t know for sure, but timing is everything. Primaries season is underway and Trump is the clear choice of most Republican so far. If Trump or Biden were to leave the race early enough, perhaps an alternate would be able to win enough delegates to capture the nomination. Given her break with Trump, it seems unlikely that most Republican would want to choose former SouthCarolina Gov. Nikki Haley. If there’s no candidate who has won a majority of the delegates after the primaries, the delegates themselves would ultimately pick alternative candidates at the party conventions this summer. That would be a fascinating and messy process to witness. If a vacancy occurred after the nominating conventions, both parties have processes to pick alternates. If, as he claims, Trump won the 2020 election, why doesn’t the 22nd Amendment keep him from running now? James in North Carolina I think you’ve identified a main problem with his continued lies about the 2020 election. The 22nd Amendment makes clear that a person can only be elected twice to the presidency. Despite what he says, however, he was not elected in 2020 and he’s not president now, so the 22nd Amendment should not apply to him.","['version', 'appears', 'cnn’s', 'matters', 'newsletter', 'inbox',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/south-carolina-trump-haley-voters/index.html,"Pawleys Island, SouthCarolina CNN — Joy Rendulic was hesitant when her husband first suggested a move to SouthCarolina. Then she visited a small ice cream shop for sale near the spectacular coast of this barrier island town. Rendulic cashed in her 401 to buy it, and left Erie, Pennsylvania, behind. “God brought me here,” Rendulic told us during a break at Island Treats ice cream shop. “I thought I was doing what I was supposed to be doing for the rest of my life, and he had a different plan. We think we are in control. But we’re not.” The big move was in 2016. Nikki Haley was the governor then, and newcomer Rendulic was impressed. “Yes, she was a very good governor,” Rendulic said. Trump speaks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, in December 2023. Carlos Barria/Reuters/File Related article CNN Poll: Most Americans want verdict on Trump election subversion charges before 2024 vote Trump won her vote for president that same year, again in 2020 and will once more when Trump and Haley square off in the SouthCarolina GOP presidential primary this month. “I totally believe that God has assigned him to this position,” Rendulic said of Trump.  “That is my true belief.” We ask what happened in 2020. “That was a mess,” Rendulic said. “That was so illegal. Some improper cheating happening to the voting procedures.” We mention all the recounts and court cases Trump lost, including cases decided by judges Trump appointed, that upheld now-Biden’s victory. “I think so many people hate Trump,” she said. “I just know there was a whole lot of cheating.” There is no evidence of that, but Rendulic is adamant. So we ask, if it was God’s plan for Trump to be president, why would God let that happen? The answer is halting. “What happened is what happened. And I believe Trump is coming again.” Rendulic represents an important slice of the Trump base: for Trump no matter what. These voter echo his false claims about rigged elections and bogus investigations and they stand by Trump even when he does things counter to their priorities. You find a lot of them in SouthCarolina, one reason Trump consistently leads the primary polls despite Haley’s home state status. Rendulic, for example, lists abortion – or the “right to life,” as she puts it – as the reason her last vote for a Democrat for president was Jimmy Carter. But she offers no criticism of Trump when we point out he has recently criticized some state abortion restrictions as too harsh and has warned it could be a losing issue for Republican. “I haven’t thought about that too much, probably,” Rendulic said. “I want it to be right to life.” No doubt Trump gets her vote. “He’s even more ready now and very, very intelligent, cares a lot about this country,” she said. “Wants to do what is right.” Looking for a tough border ‘fix’ from Trump Billy Pierce is another piece of the Trump comeback puzzle. He has lived in Hartsville – about two hours inland from the SouthCarolina coast – all his 70 years except for a stint in the Navy. Pierce says he was drawn to Trump in 2016 for the same reason he backed Ross Perot in 1992. “I wanted a non-career politician in there that would do, would run it like a company,” Pierce said in an interview in the garage office where he organizes his part-time consulting work. Pierce sees Biden as too unwilling to stand up to the Democrat left and has fond memories of the pre-Covid economy during the Trump administration. “We didn’t have the high inflation,” he said. “We didn’t have the high interest rates.” Pierce is not an election denier. He does believe it was wrong that many states adopted new voting rules during the 2020 pandemic, but said Trump should have honored the results once all his challenges were exhausted. Nor is Pierce a fan of the former president’s toxic tone. “If he’d just shut up and, you know, got off Twitter and that kind of stuff, he’d have made a great president,” Pierce said. He called himself a likely Trump voter in the primary and described the choice between Trump and Haley as “the lesser of two evils.” Billy Pierce talks to John King in Hartsville, SouthCarolina. CNN But Pierce is very much in line with Trump on policy matters. “He’s going to fix the things I need him to fix,” Pierce said, listing the border as his top priority. “Shut it down,” is Pierce’s desire, though he agrees with Trump that congressional Republican should not pass a border package before the November election – even if it would slow the flow of illegal border crossings. “This is a Democrat ploy” designed to help Biden, Pierce said. He offers a suggestion on what he would do at the border, based on his time in the military. “Have us put up razor wire,” Pierce said. “I have no problem with putting up two rows and mining the other. So if they come in, you tell them it is mined. You put signs out there that says it’s mined.” He balances such tough talk with a personal story about his daughter adopting two children from Guatemala. Be tough at the border now, Pierce said, and then conversations about more legal immigration would be possible. “It needs to be done the right way.” From sending a message to DC to sending a message to the next generation Craig Thomas lived in Tennessee when Trump caught his attention in 2016. Thomas describes himself as “conservative, some areas libertarian.” Trump, he thought then, was an outsider – and a vote for him would send a message to Washington. “It was like, alright, like this is good,” said Thomas. “Let’s blow some things up.” Now, Thomas lives in Charleston and is voting for Haley – to send a message to his two children. Craig Thomas talks to John King in Charleston, SouthCarolina. CNN He is tired of all the personal attacks and all the anger and wants a president who is also a role model. Haley, he said, “brings very similar policy positions, but definitely without the drama.” One recent MAGA conspiracy theory hit too close to home. “I don’t think there’s any sort of a crazy conspiracy between the NFL and Taylor Swift and everything else just showing up for a Biden coronation,” Thomas said. “How do I look at my daughter, who is a huge Taylor Swift fan, and this guy just attacking Taylor Swift, just because she is going to support another candidate, right.” “And other things like that. And having those conversations with them. It does matter. And it does matter who you support.” Trump as a religion Charleston is rich with both Revolutionary and Civil War history, a place where you can still ride a horse-drawn carriage down a cobblestone street. It is more affluent, more educated and less Trumpy than most of SouthCarolina. “But there is quite a bit of talk about Trump, even here,” Thomas said. Mark Sanford is out of politics because of that – because of the reach of the Trump Republican revolution. Sanford served in the House representing a Charleston-area district, and then was the state’s two-term Republican governor just before Haley was first elected in 2010. Sanford won his old House seat back in 2013, but then lost the Republican primary in 2018 because he was a sharp critic of then-Trump’s fiscal policies, and sometimes of his tone. “I would say, ‘Well I’m for Trump in this area, but I’m against in these different areas.’ But people didn’t want nuance. They want: ‘Are you for or against him.’” Sanford wouldn’t directly answer when asked how he will vote in this month’s primary. But he did offer this: “I’ve never voted for Trump so far. I know that I’m not voting for him this time. I’ll let you read the tea leaves from that.” John King talks to Mark Sanford, a former SouthCarolina governor and congressman from the Charleston area. CNN Sanford agrees when Haley goes after Trump for all the “chaos,” and especially when she highlights the deficit spending of the Trump years. Yet he expects a big Trump win in SouthCarolina, because the GOP electorate is so different now from when he was first elected. “What has traditionally worked in GOP politics isn’t so much working these days,” he said in an interview at his home in the Charleston suburb of Mount Pleasant. “He became sort of a proxy litmus test for ‘Are you for or against the system,’” Sanford said. “I’ve seen this erosion,” Sanford said. “Sort of Perot movement to Tea Party to Trump. It’s metastasized in ever aggressive forms. And what started out as a lot of well meaning Americans saying, ‘Look, we’ve got to do something about politicians doing what they said they were going to do’ into something much more strident. … It is their religion. I mean, I, I don’t know how else to explain it.”","['pawleys', 'island', 'southcarolina', 'joy', 'rendulic', 'hesitant', 'husband', 'first', 'suggested', 'move', 'southcarolina', 'visited', 'small',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/politics/fact-check-biden-makes-three-false-claims-about-his-handling-of-classified-information/index.html,"Biden gave a press conference Thursday night after the release of a report from special counsel Robert Hur, who announced that Biden would not face charges over his handling of classified information from prior to his presidency. Biden was combative , forcefully rejecting Hur’s claims that he has a poor memory. But the president was also repeatedly inaccurate, making three claims that were clearly contradicted by Hur’s report. Here is a fact check. Where the classified material was stored Biden sought to contrast his handling of classified material with that of former Trump, who faces felony charges for willfully retaining classified documents . But while Biden correctly noted that the documents were in a private home that is very different from the Mar-a-Lago social club where Trump lives, Biden embellished his argument with a false claim. Biden said: “All the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.” Facts First: Biden claim is not true. The special counsel’s report says that while some of the classified documents were found in cabinet drawers in Biden Delaware home, other classified documents, about Afghanistan, were found in an “unsealed” and “badly damaged” box sitting in his garage alongside an assortment of other items the special counsel described as “household detritus.” The report includes a photo of the box. Hur wrote that investigators looked into the possibility that the Afghanistan-related documents found in the box were previously stored in a filing cabinet when Biden lived in a rented home in Virginia before moving out in 2019. Hur called that line of inquiry “inconclusive.” Regardless, Biden Thursday claim that “all” of the documents in his home were in locked or lockable filing cabinets is not true of his current home. According to the special counsel, even classified documents Biden was storing elsewhere in his home were insufficiently secure. Hur wrote that Biden notebooks containing classified information from his vice presidency were found by investigators in “unlocked drawers in the office and basement den” of the home. Hur wrote that Biden “should have known” that as a private citizen as of 2017, “he was not permitted to keep handwritten notes about the President’s Daily Brief and other classified information in unlocked drawers in his home.” At a White House briefing on Friday, Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the White House Counsel’s Office, would not directly answer when asked about Biden claims about the security of the documents held at his home. “Look, I think the president was trying to address a number of inaccurate allegations in this … report,” Sams told CNN’s MJ Lee. “I don’t have anything … to add on what he said last night.” Asked later whether he was saying the special counsel’s report was inaccurate about the storage of documents, Sams again avoided responding directly. “The report lays out in 400 pages of detail all of the evidence and all of the review that they conducted in looking into this matter,” he said. “The president made sure that all of the classified documents that were found were returned promptly to the government, which is what you’re supposed to do, which is why this is the inevitable conclusion that there is no case here.” When the reporter pressed Sams, saying that wasn’t a response to his question, Sams replied: “I understand what you’re trying to ask.” He did not respond further to the question. The classification level of the documents Biden had in his possession Biden claimed of the documents he possessed: “None of it was high classified. It didn’t have any of that red stuff on it, you know what I mean, around the corners? None of that.” Facts First : Biden claim that none of the classified material found in his possession was highly classified is false, according to details provided by the special counsel. Hur reported the discovery of documents in Biden possession that had markings identifying them as “Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information,” a very high level of classification – plus handwritten notebooks from Biden time as vice president that weren’t marked as classified but that “contain information that remains classified up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information level.” It’s not clear whether any of the marked classified documents found in Biden possession had the colored borders seen on some of the marked classified documents found in Trump possession , which is what Biden appeared to be referring to when he spoke about “that red stuff…around the corners.” Regardless, Hur explained at length that some of the documents were marked as Top Secretand some with other notations identifying them as highly classified. For example, Hur wrote, the open box in Biden garage contained an Afghanistan-related memo from the National Security Adviser to President Barack Obama in 2009 marked “TOP SECRET/SCI”. Hur wrote that experts in the intelligence community said the document contains “highly sensitive information about the military programs of the United States and a foreign government. The unauthorized disclosure of this information, both today and in 2017 when Mr. Biden was no longer vice president, reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.” Hur wrote that the box in the garage contained another 2009 memo from the National Security Adviser to Obama marked “TOP SECRET WITH TOP SECRET/NOFORN/CODEWORD ATTACHMENTS” with attachments, one of which was marked “TOP SECRET//HUMINT/COMINT//ORCON/NOFORN//FISA.”Hur wrote that experts said “portions of this document contain national defense information about sensitive intelligence sources and methods.” In addition, Hur wrote that notebooks with handwritten notes Biden took during his vice presidency contained information on “U.S. intelligence sources, methods, and capabilities,” “U.S. intelligence activities” and “the activities of foreign intelligence services,” among other things. Hur wrote that when investigators looked into a sampling of 37 excerpts from Biden handwritten materials that appeared to be classified, they found that “eight are Top Secret with Sensitive Compartmented Information, seven of which include information concerning human intelligence sources,” while six are Top Secret alone, 21 Secret and two Confidential. “Mr. Biden wrote down obviously sensitive information discussed during intelligence briefings with then President Obama and meetings in the White House Situation Room about matters of national security and military and foreign policy,” Hur wrote. What Hur said Biden said to his ghostwriter Hur said in the report that Biden disclosed classified material from his notebooks to the ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer,  who worked with him on a 2017 memoir called “Promise Me, Dad.” But Biden categorically denied that he had shared classified information with the ghostwriter, saying he can “guarantee” he didn’t. When a reporter responded that the special counsel said he did, Biden responded, “No, they did not say that. He did not say that.” Facts First : Biden claim is false. Hur did say that, writing explicitly that “Mr. Biden shared information, including some classified information, from those notebooks with his ghostwriter.” He elaborated that Biden shared classified information with his ghostwriter by reading “nearly verbatim” from his notebooks “on at least three occasions,” including his “notes from meetings in the Situation Room.” Hur did find, however, that Biden “at times” tried to avoid sharing classified information, by stopping at or skipping over certain material from the notebooks. And he wrote that “the evidence does not show that when Mr. Biden shared the specific passages with his ghostwriter, Mr. Biden knew the passages were classified and intended to share classified information.” Hur wrote that in one recorded conversation with the ghostwriter in 2017, at the Virginia home where Biden then lived, Biden read from his notebook about a National Security Council meeting about Iraq in 2015, then told the ghostwriter about a 2009 memo he had written to Obama arguing against the deployment of more troops to Afghanistan – and then said, “I just found all the classified stuff downstairs.” Hur noted that more than five years later, investigators found classified documents about the Afghanistan troop surge in Biden Delaware garage. Hur wrote that he has not heard of any allegations that classified material actually appeared in Biden 2017 memoir","['biden', 'gave', 'press', 'conference', 'thursday', 'night', 'release', 'report',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/politics/fact-check-trump-invade-iraq/index.html,"Trump repeated a variety of his previous false claims about the Middle East, rival Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other subjects in an interview that aired Sunday morning on Fox News – notably including his years-old lie that he warned the US not to invade Iraq. Here’s a non-comprehensive roundup. Invasion of Iraq Trump revived a lie he has been uttering since his 2016 presidential campaign – an assertion that he publicly spoke out against the idea of invading Iraq. He said on Fox: “Going into Iraq was a stupid thing. Remember I used to say: ‘Don’t do it, but if you do it, keep the oil.’” Facts First: Trump claim that he said “Don’t do it” is false ; the claim was debunked eight years ago . In reality, Trump did not publicly express opposition to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq before it occurred . In his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” Trump argued a military strike on Iraq might be necessary; when radio host Howard Stern asked Trump in September 2002 whether he is “for invading Iraq,” Trump responded, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly”; and Trump did not express a firm opinion about the looming war in a Fox interview in January 2003 , saying that “either you attack or don’t attack” and that then-President George W. Bush “has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps.” Trump began criticizing the war in 2003, but after the invasion, and also said that year that American troops should not be withdrawn from Iraq. He emerged as an explicit opponent of the war in 2004. You can read more here about his shifting positions. A CNN search in 2019 turned up no examples of Trump saying anything before the war about keeping Iraq’s oil. Trump White House did not respond at the time to our request to provide any such evidence. Iran’s missiles Trump repeated a claim he has made at various campaign events in recent months , saying Iran intentionally avoided hitting a base that housed US troops in Iraq when it launched missiles toward the base in January 2020 in retaliation for the Trump-ordered assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani . Trump claimed on Fox, as he has before, that Iran “called me” to let him know of its plan to deliberately miss. He said, “We knew they weren’t going to hit inside the fort” even though outside observers were left wondering, “How come they all missed?” Facts First : Trump claims that all of Iran’s missiles missed the base are false. As The Washington Post noted in its own fact check late last year, 11 Iranian missiles hit the al-Asad base Iran targeted in the retaliatory attack. The fact that missiles hit the base was confirmed by satellite images , by the Pentagon , and by a CNN visit to the base days after the attack. CNN reported from the scene: “Ten of the 11 missiles struck US positions at the sprawling desert Iraqi airbase. One struck a remote location on the Iraqi military’s side.” CNN reported that “the Iranian missiles, which used on-board guidance systems, managed to shred sensitive US military sites, damaging a special forces compound, and two hangars, in addition to the US drone operators’ housing unit.” While no US troops were killed, more than 100 were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injuries. Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, told reporters he believed Iran’s intent was to kill; he credited “the defensive techniques that our forces used” for the absence of deaths. Trump has provided no substantiation for the claim that Iran called him to telegraph the strike and offer reassurance. As The Post reported, Iraq’s prime minister said he received a general warning from Iran that it was about to begin its response and target US troops. New Hampshire primary Trump said the New Hampshire primary he won in January was the one place that Haley had a chance to win – claiming that this is “because Democrat are stupidly allowed to vote in the Republican primary, and independents also.” Facts First : Trump claim is false . Registered Democrat aren’t allowed to vote in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. Only registered Republican and independents are allowed to vote . Some independents who lean toward Democrat almost certainly participated in the Republican primary, plus some Democrat who switched their affiliation to independent before the early October deadline. But Trump claimed, with no caveats, that Democrat are simply allowed to vote in New Hampshire. That’s not true. Indiana primary ballot Trump claimed of Haley: “We have a situation where they forgot to apply, I guess, for Indiana. You don’t run and not apply for Indiana. Great state.” Facts First : This is false. Haley did not forget to apply to be on the Republican primary ballot in Indiana. The filing deadline for the May 7 primary, February 9, has not arrived yet. Trump has previously made a different claim that Haley did not submit enough signatures by the state’s January 30 signature deadline to qualify for the ballot; Haley’s campaign told CNN and other media outlets that this is not true and that she submitted more than enough signatures. Regardless, the campaign didn’t forget to apply. “We’ll be on the ballot. We turned in more than double all the signatures required and they are being verified now as part of the process before the filing deadline on February 9,” Haley campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a Sunday email. In response to a similar claim from Trump, Haley wrote on social media on Friday: “Looks like he’s confused again…” Mitch McConnell and the Green New Deal In a clip from the interview that Fox aired Friday, Trump claimed McConnell has supported trillions in spending on “projects that are Green New Deal.” The Green New Deal is a broad congressional resolution , supported by some Democrat legislators, that calls for major investments in a wide variety of environmental, social and economic initiatives . “Mitch McConnell: I mean, he’s agreed billions of dollars and trillions of dollars for projects that are Green New Deal – you know, I call it the Green New Scam – trillions of dollars for the Green New Scam,” Trump said . Facts First : Trump claim that McConnell has supported “trillions” in spending on Green New Deal projects is false even under a generous-to-Trump definition of what counts as a Green New Deal project. And as in the past , Trump failed to mention here that McConnell has been a vocal opponent of the Green New Deal congressional resolution as  a whole – and that Congress has never actually passed the resolution. McConnell has repeatedly denounced the Green New Deal resolution, describing it as, among other things, “radical,” “socialist” and a “mess.” So what is Trump talking about? Trump similar past attacks have been about how McConnell voted in 2021 for a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that contained spending that overlaps with some of the proposals in the wide-ranging Green New Deal resolution. For example, the 2021 infrastructure bill contained tens of billions in spending on cleaning up toxic waste sites, modernizing public transportation, increasing the country’s resilience against climate change, ensuring drinking water is clean, and facilitating a transition to zero- and low-emissions vehicles. But even if you were to count all of this as “Green New Deal” spending – which would be misleading given that the list includes priorities that both parties funded long before the Green New Deal was introduced in 2019 – the total would be in the hundreds of billions, not “trillions.” McConnell opposed a major Democrat bill in 2022 that spent hundreds of billions more on climate initiatives. Border wall Touting his performance on immigration policy, Trump claimed, as he has before, “I built 561 miles of wall.” Facts First : Trump “561 miles” claim is false, a substantial exaggeration. An official report by US Customs and Border Protection , written two days after Trump left office and subsequently obtained by CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said the number built under Trump was 458 miles. Even in his campaign speeches late last year, Trump sometimes put the figure, more correctly, at “nearly 500 miles.” You can read more here ","['trump', 'repeated', 'variety', 'previous', 'false',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/politics/kfile-whatley-promoted-false-election-fraud-claims/index.html,"Trump and his allies are pushing to replace the chair of the Republican National Committee with North Carolina’s party leader who promoted 2020 presidential election lies and supported using the courts to overturn the results. Michael Whatley, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, shared false claims that Republican observers were prevented from accessing polling locations and repeatedly said Democrat cities in swing states were engaged in “massive fraud,” a CNN KFile review of Whatley’s comments following the election found. Whatley, who has since acknowledged Biden is the country’s legitimate president, currently serves as general counsel at the RNC overseeing litigation and what the organization calls its “election integrity” efforts. His elevation to RNC chair could give Trump a loyalist more willing to devote resources to pursue future voter fraud claims in court should they arise. One reason why Trump soured on Ronna McDaniel, the current chair, was his perception she should have done more to fight for his candidacy in 2020, CNN reported. Like many Republican, Whatley publicly backed Trump voter fraud claims on multiple occasions following the 2020 election. “Regardless of how these lawsuits come out around the country with the presidential race we do know that there was massive fraud that took place,” Whatley said in one late November 2020 interview on local North Carolina radio. “We know that it took place in places like Milwaukee and Detroit and Philadelphia.” There is no evidence of massive fraud in any of those cities or around the country as Republican election officials and Trump-appointed former Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged . Trump and his supporters filed more than 60 cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one. Whatley, a former Senate staffer and one-time lobbyist focused on energy-related issues, said in a statement to CNN he believed pandemic related changes to voting laws weakened safeguards against voter fraud. “There is no question that changes to the 2020 election process which weakened safeguards on absentee and mail-in vote in some states led to distrust by many across the Country. I firmly believe in having proper safeguards in place to ensure that it is easy to vote and hard to cheat.“ Whatley is one of two candidates Trump and his allies are supporting to take over the RNC. The other is Drew McKissick, the chairman of the SouthCarolina Republican Party. Trump turned on McDaniel over the poor finances and management of the RNC at a time when the organization is facing one of its worst fundraising years in a decade. CNN reported Tuesday that McDaniel is planning to step down at the end of the month. Despite Trump preferred picks, only RNC members can choose to elect the new chairman. False claims about the 2020 election In his capacity as chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party in the days following the 2020 election, Whatley parroted much of Trump false election claims. One day before the election was called for Biden, Whatley echoed false claims about Republican poll watchers being barred from observation. “There’s also issues [in] surrounding states like Michigan and Pennsylvania where they’re not allowing Republican observers into the polling location to watch the voting,” Whatley said. “When we have instances of voter fraud, then obviously if those are widespread enough to be able to, you know, affect the outcome, you’re gonna have litigation that’s gonna deal with those.” One week following the 2020 election, Whatley called it alarming that the results would be determined in court but said it was the strategy needed for Trump to secure victory. At the time, there were recounts occurring in major swing states – all of which would affirm Biden victory. “I think that what we’re seeing in Georgia, especially with the hand recount,” he said on local North Carolina radio . “What we’re seeing in Arizona where we’re gonna have a recount out there as well – And then it’s gonna basically put states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin into court. It really is kind of scary proposition to think that you’re gonna have a court overturn some of those results. But that’s really the plan.” “And I get asked every single day by a reporter, why do you keep alleging that there’s fraud out there?” he continued. “And it’s like, all you have to do is look at the stories that we’re seeing out of Philadelphia, the Detroit area, we’re seeing out of Milwaukee, egregious violations of election law. And there’s no question why it puts these elections at risk.” At the time, Trump and his allies were inundating the public with unfounded allegations of fraud in Democrat cities. They made baseless claims of excluded poll watchers, fake reports of suitcases filled with fraudulent ballots, bogus allegations of bussed-in ballots from NewYork to swing states and false assertions that Philadelphia had more ballots than voter. Whatley pointed to the contested 2000 presidential election recount in Florida, where he served on the Bush recount team during the legal disputes between George W. Bush and Al Gore, to argue the election was far from over. Ultimately, the SupremeCourt intervened and stopped the recount, effectively deciding the election in Bush’s favor. “We’re not done in the presidential. We’re not done at all,” he added, referring to the 2020 election, in the interview. Condemned January 6th - but suggested not done by “Republican voter” In an interview on January 2, 2021, Whatley resigned himself to Biden being President – but said objections to the election were important to discuss the claims of fraud. “I think the fact that we’re likely to have the outcome be that Biden is going to get certified and sworn in, does not mean that these protests are irrelevant,” he said . “It is absolutely critical that we have a national dialogue on election integrity. What we saw in places like Milwaukee and Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Phoenix is really very, very troubling.” Following the riot on January 6, 2021, Whatley condemned those who broke into the Capitol building in interviews. “The actions of these violent protestors is completely unjustified and unacceptable. There is no rationale to excuse this assault on the foundations of our Democracy,” he said in a tweet since deleted. In an interview, Whatley described himself as “appalled” by January 6th riot, but said the Republican Party as “a whole” was not “complicit” in what happened. “Most of the people that have been arrested were not necessarily Republican voter,” Whatley said in February 2021. “There’s certainly Trump supporters in there, but we’ve also seen others and we’re gonna unequivocally condemn those actions. In the aftermath of the January 6th some have sought to deflect blame for the riot by alleging Republican partisans weren’t the primarily force behind it, though subsequent investigations have shown that those arrested were mostly Trump supporters. In another interview in February 2021 , Whatley acknowledged Biden as “legitimately” elected President of the United States. “I was a member of the Electoral College, and I proudly cast my vote for Trump. But the Electoral college voted. And a majority was for Biden and he is the President of the United.” Following Biden inauguration, Whatley attacked the impeachment of former Trump and in March referred to the Republican Party as “Trump party,” at a local event.","['trump', 'allies', 'pushing', 'replace', 'chair', 'republican', 'national', 'committee', 'north', 'carolina’s', 'leader', 'promoted', '2020', 'presidential',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/congress-border-vote-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — A plague on both these houses: The Senate seems to lack the political will for a bipartisan border deal. The House lacks an effective majority for a partisan impeachment effort as GOP leaders scramble for vote. And so the knot of US immigration policy seems likely to stay hopelessly tied even though both sides of the aisle now agree there’s a disaster at the border. Additional aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan is also locked up. Partisan impeachment effort flailing House Republican should be taking a victory lap. Their pressure helped create an environment in which a Democrat president was promising to shut the US border with Mexico to new arrivals, confirming their years of warning about the flow of asylum-seekers from Central and South America and other continents. In return, Biden wanted additional funding for Ukraine and Israel, something many Republican also support. Rather than respond to acknowledgment of the border crisis by working with Democrat and the White House on a deal, House Republican planned instead to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as a protest of Biden immigration approach. Except, as the vote approached, they seemed to realize they might not have the vote to impeach Mayorkas after all. Their majority is so small they can only afford to lose two or three vote, depending on how many lawmakers show up to vote. Two Republican, Reps. Ken Buck of Colorado and Tom McClintock of California, oppose the impeachment. “Maladministration or incompetence does not rise to what our founders considered an impeachable offense,” Buck wrote in an op-ed for The Hill in which he eviscerated Mayorkas but rejected impeachment. The impeachment articles “stretch and distort the Constitution in order to hold the administration accountable for stretching and distorting the law,” McClintock wrote in a memo . The only other time a Cabinet member was impeached , back in 1876, it was with a unanimous House vote. With hours to go before the Mayorkas impeachment vote is set to occur, there is a real possibility it could fail, and it can only pass by the slimmest of margins. Bipartisan border deal imploding Partisanship isn’t working. And neither is bipartisanship. Senate Democrat negotiators came nearly all the way to Republican on what was billed as a bipartisan border deal . CIUDAD JUAREZ, MEXICO - FEBRUARY 01: Seen from an aerial view, immigrants walk along the U.S.-Mexico border wall after crossing the Rio Grande into El Paso, Texas on February 01, 2024 from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. They had also passed through razor wire set by Texas National Guard troops in order to proceed for processing by U.S. Border Patrol agents. John Moore/Getty Images Related article What the border bill would and wouldn’t do Abandoning hope of giving children of undocumented immigrants permanent legal status or creating a pathway to citizenship for migrants who built their lives in the US, Democrat negotiators appeared ready to give the president – which could be Trump next year – broad new temporary authority to essentially shut down the border when crossings reach certain thresholds, raise the bar for people to seek asylum in the US and cut down on the practice of allowing people to work in the US while their cases are in immigration court. On “Inside Politics” on Wednesday, as news broke of Republican leaders turning against the deal by opposing procedural vote this week, CNN’s Dana Bash interviewed Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, who spearheaded negotiations for Republican. “Are you gobsmacked?” she asked, listing off the GOP immigration priorities that opponents are willing to leave on the table rather than work with Democrat. “I’m legitimately surprised at where we are at this moment because, as Republican, we’ve done lots of press conferences at the border, had lots of conversations, saying things have to change,” Lankford said. “At the end of it, the worst-case scenario is to do nothing,” Lankford said. “We need to do something. And I think American people, regardless of your political persuasion, want to see actually something change on the border.” House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t think any new law is required for Biden to shut down the border and argued at a press conference that even a bill House Republican passed last year was unnecessary, other than it would compel the president to do more. “We will continue to remind the American people that it is one individual, the commander in chief, the most power political figure in this country, who could end the catastrophe that he, specifically, and we believe intentionally, created,” Johnson said. Biden, meanwhile, was trying out campaign-trail material in an appearance at the White House. “Every day between now and November, the American people are going to know that the only reason the border is not secure is Trump and his MAGA Republican friends,” he said","['version', 'appears', 'cnn’s', 'matters', 'newsletter', 'inbox', 'sign', 'free', 'plague', 'houses', 'senate', 'seems', 'lack',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/haley-voters-trump-gop-biden-analysis/index.html,"As the SouthCarolina Republican primary approaches, the evidence is growing that Nikki Haley’s coalition is almost certainly not large enough to deny Trump the GOP presidential nomination. But evidence is also accumulating that her coalition is more than large enough to deny Trump the White House in a general election if her voter remain as alienated from him as they now say they are. Story highlights Haley is exposing fault lines in the GOP coalition Her coalition doesn't appear to be enough to stop Trump from winning the nomination But her supporters present an opportunity for Biden to peel off crossover voter in a possible rematch with Trump The support for Haley in the early GOP contests has mapped, probably more precisely than ever before, the segments of the Republican electorate most deeply disaffected with Trump. In a possible rematch with Trump this fall, Biden will likely need to attract crossover support from a significant share of those ordinarily Republican-leaning voter to overcome the towering discontent evident in polls about his own performance. So far, most polls show Biden making only very limited inroads in a general election against Trump with the kind of GOP primary voter displaying the most support for Haley – a universe centered on college-educated, ideologically centrist, and Republican-leaning independent voter. But surveys of voter participating in the Iowa and New Hampshire nominating contests show that most Haley supporters express deeply negative views about Trump. That could provide Biden an opening for greater gains in the months ahead – if he can resolve, or even temper, more of those voter’ doubts about his own record, age and strength. “If there’s anything that should be sending warning flares up in the sky for the Trump people, this is it,” said Ace Smith, a California-based Democrat strategist, referring to the large number of Haley voter expressing negative views of the former president in polls. Long-time GOP strategist Michael Madrid, who advised the anti-Trump Lincoln Project in 2020, said the evidence of the early Republican results, and polls of GOP voter nationwide about the Trump-Haley contest, are sending the party a clear, but dual, message. Trump speaks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, in December 2023. Carlos Barria/Reuters/File Related article CNN Poll: Most Americans want verdict on Trump election subversion charges before 2024 vote On the one hand, Madrid said, all of these signals show “there’s not a lane for anyone else to get the nomination: This is Trump party.” But the same evidence, Madrid said, shows “Trump is entering this race significantly weaker with the Republican base than at any time since he secured the nomination in 2016.” The first stages of the battle for the 2024 GOP nomination have largely confirmed the party’s divided attitudes about Trump, which have been seen in national surveys over the past several years. Depending on the question, somewhere between one-fifth and one-third of self-identified GOP partisans have consistently expressed negative views in polls about Trump, particularly regarding his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection and his broader effort to overturn the 2020 election result. For instance, in a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland national survey , between 19% to 23% of Republican and independents who lean toward the party agreed that Trump bore significant responsibility for the January 6 riot; that Trump “threatened democracy” when he told his supporters to march on the Capitol that day; that he was likely guilty of the criminal charges against him for attempting to overturn the 2020 election; and that the January 6 assault “was an attack on democracy that should never be forgotten.” Likewise, in a recent CBS poll released on the third anniversary of January 6 , about one-fourth of Republican said they would describe the attack on the Capitol as an insurrection and an attempt to overthrow the US government. Roughly 3-in-10 Republican said Biden had legitimately won the 2020 election and about one-third opposed pardons for the January 6 rioters, which Trump has signaled he will offer if elected to another term. More broadly, in the latest CNN national poll conducted by SSRS , just under one-fourth of Republican and GOP-leaning independents said they viewed Trump unfavorably. Almost exactly the same share said the party would have a better chance to win in November with a nominee other than Trump . In a national NBC News poll released Sunday , 22% of GOP primary voter agreed that “the Republican Party needs a new leader with better personal behavior and a different approach” than Trump, while another 14% said “Trump was a good president, but it is time to consider other leaders.” Across all of these questions, the share of Republican-leaning voter expressing negative views about Trump does not nearly approach a majority of the party. That explains why Haley faces such a steep uphill climb against him for the nomination, even though she has finally achieved the one-on-one race against Trump that his Republican critics have sought since 2016. Yet through Iowa and New Hampshire, despite not winning those contests, the former SouthCarolina governor has demonstrated that the minority of the party that has long expressed anti-Trump views in polls can be mobilized into a coherent coalition of resistance to him at the ballot box. And at a time when the nation is divided so closely between Republican and Democrat, defection from even such a minority faction in his own camp could be difficult for Trump to overcome in a general election should he advance that far. Biden and former Trump AP, Getty Images Related article CNN Poll: Trump narrowly leads Biden in general election rematch Even if only about 1-in-10 ordinarily Republican voter “would defect if Trump is the nominee, that’s potentially significant in a close election,” said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist . In Iowa, the voter resisting Trump split between Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has since dropped out; in New Hampshire they consolidated around Haley as the sole remaining alternative. But in each case, the GOP voter rejecting Trump have displayed similar demographic and ideological characteristics, according to the entrance and exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. In each state, Trump showed significantly less strength among voter with a college degree than those without one and much less strength among independents who voted than partisan Republican. He also lagged among voter who identify as somewhat conservative or moderate compared to those who called themselves “very conservative” and did not run as well among those who do not identify as evangelical Christians as those who do. “This is not a casual vote, it’s a really thought-out vote,” said Celinda Lake, a long-time Democrat pollster who advised Biden 2020 campaign. “It has a whole schema around it – views about policy, views about temperament, about the criminal cases. It’s a very integrated view [about Trump].” In the two kick-off contests, Haley voter in particular expressed strikingly negative views about Trump and his assertions about the 2020 election. In the entrance poll conducted of GOP caucusgoers in Iowa, almost exactly 4-in-5 Haley voter said Trump would not be fit to serve as president again if convicted of a crime, according to results provided by CNN’s polling unit; likewise 4-in-5 Haley Iowa voter said Biden had legitimately won the 2020 election. In New Hampshire, more than 4-in-5 Haley voter said Trump would not be fit to serve again if convicted and that Biden had legitimately won. Fully 85% of Haley supporters said they would be dissatisfied if Trump were the nominee. The AP/NORC VoteCast poll offered similar warning signs for Trump. In that poll, two-thirds of Haley voter in Iowa said they would not vote for Trump in a general election; that number soared past three-fourths of her voter in New Hampshire. The Washington Post/Monmouth University poll of GOP voter in SouthCarolina released last week showed Trump opening a resounding 26 percentage point lead over Haley in her home state, which will hold its critical GOP primary on February 24. Yet the survey also raised the same general election red flags for Trump as the Edison surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire. In this September 2020 photo, Trump speaks during the first presidential debate against Biden at the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Morry Gash/Pool/Getty Images/File Related article A Biden-Trump rematch would be mostly about Trump In the SouthCarolina poll, roughly three-fourths of those voting for Haley said they viewed Trump unfavorably; over three-fourths said Biden legitimately won in 2020; nearly three-fifths said Trump committed a crime in his response to that result; and less than one-in-five said they planned to vote for Trump in November. Smith said that the resistance to Trump surfacing in these early GOP primary polls will be “a huge, huge problem” for him in the general election. Two factors largely explain it, he believes: hostility to Trump role in overturning the nationwide legal right to abortion, which the US SupremeCourt did in 2022, “plus people just not wanting the craziness and the chaos.” Madrid said the cumulative evidence from the early election results and these surveys indicates that the component of the GOP coalition dubious of Trump is larger than most people have thought – and likely larger than at any point since he first emerged as the party’s nominee in 2016. The Republican critical of Trump were so isolated that “we used to be on one group chat and now we are running out of muskets to hand out to be in the conflict,” Madrid said. “I think everybody you talk to will all say the same thing: something has shifted. [Haley] is becoming the rallying cry for something different and something bigger, and that tells me that the swamp fever has broken with a wide part of the Republican Party.” Madrid estimates that the share of ordinarily Republican-leaning voter fundamentally disaffected with Trump has grown from around 6%-8% in 2020 to as much as nearly 20% now. Still, experts in both parties agree that many of the Haley primary voter now saying they would not support Trump in November would eventually fall into line behind him if he becomes the nominee. Haley herself, of course, has said that if she loses the nomination she would vote for Trump over Biden “any day of the week.” Jennifer Horn, a former New Hampshire Republican party chair who has become a fierce Trump critic, said, “I don’t think that whole 30%” or so of GOP voter coalescing behind Haley in the early states “goes to Biden because amongst that 30% are folks that are very loyal Republican. They might not be loyal MAGA … but we know there are people out there who simply won’t vote for a Democrat.” The key “question for Biden,” she added, “is how many of the others can he win over?” Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump 2024 campaign, said that Trump would suffer minimal defections in the GOP coalition in a rematch with Biden because Republican voter believe Trump presidency produced far better results on the issues they care about than the current administration. “As long as they think Biden is a really bad president, [Trump] will still keep those” voter now flocking to Haley, McLaughlin said. “They will be voting their self-interest. They are voting their pocketbooks, the border, crime and safety. They are voting war and peace. We always say the presidential race is decided by the two p’s: peace and prosperity. And on those ‘two p’s’ they look at Trump and say, he did a better job.” The CNN national poll released last week suggests that many of the Republican skeptical of Trump are indeed making that calculation. In a hypothetical matchup against the former president, the survey found Biden winning just 6% of GOP partisans and independents who leaned toward the party – far fewer than the 23% of those voter who expressed an unfavorable view of Trump. One key reason: fully 93% of all GOP-leaning voter said they disapproved of Biden performance as president. Similarly, in the new national NBC poll, just 8% of all GOP primary voter said they plan to vote for Biden in the general election – far fewer than the more than one-third in the survey who said they wanted the party to move beyond Trump. “I just don’t think there’s some significant possibility of [the] people telling AP VoteCast or the Exit Poll they are Republican not voting for Trump,” despite what they say now, veteran GOP pollster Bill McInturff – whose firm conducts the NBC survey with a Democrat partner – said in an email. Lake agrees the Republican disaffection surfacing in the primaries is so far translating more into hesitance about Trump than support for Biden. But she sees opportunities for Biden to flip more of those conflicted voter in the months ahead. Trump vehement personal attacks on Haley – as well as his vituperative comments about E. Jean Carroll and his supporters’ fervid denunciations of Taylor Swift ­– will alienate more GOP-leaning women, Lake believes. And the fact that so many independents have made the effort to participate in a Republican primary to vote against Trump, she said, shows they remain within reach for Biden, even if they are down on his performance now. In addition, Lake noted, the Haley coalition revolves heavily around college-educated voter who are the most likely to express growing optimism about the economy, particularly with the stock market surging. Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster who advised the super PAC supporting DeSantis during his presidential run, takes a position somewhere in between McInturff and Lake. Wilson believes many of the voter flocking to Haley are lost to a Trump-led GOP, but that Trump can win a general election without them. He can offset any defections, Wilson wrote in an email, “by winning vote from groups that would have voted for Democrat prior to the last few elections.” “We can see in some of the recent national polls what his 2024 path to victory might look like,” Wilson added, “and it’s through the White and Hispanic working class rather than by winning over all the Haley voter.” Madrid counters that the primary results so far show Trump faces the risk that his losses among upscale voter compared to 2020 will exceed his gains in blue-collar and non-White communities. Madrid believes Biden record on immigration is the biggest obstacle to him harvesting support among the Republican uneasy about Trump. Discontent over illegal immigration, Madrid argues, is the most powerful weapon Trump will have in a general election to win back Republican-leaning women who both dislike his behavior and support abortion rights. For Biden, who has endorsed a tough bipartisan Senate immigration bill, “the best way he can guarantee his reelection is to crash hard into the center on that issue, and go hard on the border,” Madrid said. Lake doesn’t agree that any single issue is critical for Biden with the kind of GOP voter who have rallied to Haley. Instead, she believes the GOP primaries are again showing that Trump biggest weakness are doubts about his character, demeanor and priorities. “We know that they [the Republican resistant to Trump] are worried about how strong and effective Biden can be,” Lake said. “But the reality is their vote is going to be about Trump; it’s not going to be about Biden. Biden has to be the mirror to show you what Trump really is. Where Trump is chaos, he is steady. Where Trump is about revenge, he is about solutions.” The widespread dissatisfaction with Biden performance has generated ominous splits in the Democrat coalition, particularly among younger voter and minority men. Finding ways to exploit the divisions in the GOP coalition that Haley has exposed may be Biden best hope of overcoming the cracks in his own electoral foundation.","['southcarolina', 'republican',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/fulton-county-fani-willis-trump-hearing/index.html,"The judge presiding over the Georgia election subversion case against Trump and several co-defendants said Monday that the district attorney who brought the case could be disqualified if she financially benefitted from a personal relationship with her lead prosecutor on the case. A hearing is set for Thursday on motions to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis based on allegations that she and Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired, engaged in an improper romantic relationship that amounted to a conflict of interest. Trump and his co-defendants are also seeking to get the entire case dismissed. “I think it’s clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or an appearance of one,” Judge Scott McAfee said during a hearing on Monday over subpoenas that defense attorneys have issued for Thursday’s dismissal hearing. “The state has admitted a relationship existed,” McAfee said. “So what remains to be proven is the existence and extent of any financial benefit, again if there even was one. Because I think it’s possible that the facts alleged by the defendant could result in disqualification. I think an evidentiary hearing must occur to establish the record on those core allegations.” McAfee was clear, however, that Thursday’s hearing would be limited in scope, noting that not all of the issues raised by defense attorneys over Wade and Willis are relevant. “The issues at point here are whether a relationship existed, whether that relationship was romantic or non-romantic in nature, when it formed and whether it continues,” McAfee said. “And that’s only relevant because it’s in combination with the question of the existence and extent of any benefit conveyed as a result of their relationship.” Video Ad Feedback Law Professor: Why DA Willis should take leave of absence 04:55 - Source: CNN Anna Cross, a lawyer representing the district attorney, attacked the motions to dismiss the case, arguing that defense attorneys who brought the allegations against Willis and Wade were peddling in “gossip.” “The defense is not bringing you facts, the defense is not bringing you law, the defense is bringing you gossip,” Cross said. “The court should not condone that practice.” Willis could also be required to testify, the judge said, noting that the defense attorneys have “established a good faith basis for relevance.” A defense attorney for one of the defendants in the case, Mike Roman, has subpoenaed Willis and several of her staff to testify during Thursday’s hearing. While McAfee said Willis may not be the first witness called on Thursday, he did not rule out the possibility of Willis taking the stand. Willis had sought to quash subpoenas.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/austin-cancels-brussels-trip/index.html,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin canceled a trip to Brussels for NATO and Ukraine meetings later this week as he remains hospitalized at Walter Reed medical center, according to a defense official familiar with the plans. Austin was taken to the hospital Sunday afternoon with symptoms “suggesting an emergent bladder issue,” Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Sunday. Austin was then admitted to the hospital’s critical care unit later in the evening for additional care and close monitoring, the hospital said. Ryder said Monday that Austin is in the intensive care unit “in order to provide appropriate privacy,” and he will remain there for the duration of his stay. Austin’s doctors said in a statement Monday afternoon that Austin underwent “non-surgical procedures under general anesthesia to address his bladder issue.” “We anticipate a successful recovery and will closely monitor him overnight,” the statement said, adding that Austin’s doctors believe he will be able to resume his duties as defense secretary on Tuesday. It is still unclear how long Austin will remain at the hospital, according to medical staff, though his doctors’ statement said they did not anticipate a “prolonged hospital stay.” Austin was supposed to lead a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels, followed by a meeting of the NATO Defense Ministerial. Austin attended the January 23 meeting of the UDCG virtually from his home. This week’s meeting of the UDCG will again be held virtually. On Sunday afternoon, Austin transferred his duties to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, notifying the president, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Congress, according to the Pentagon. Ryder said Monday that Austin would be represented at the UDCG by Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, and at the NATO Defense Ministerial by Ambassador Julianne Smith, the US permanent representative to NATO. Austin has faced significant criticism for his failure to notify senior administration officials, including Biden, of his previous hospitalization and his diagnosis with prostate cancer. Austin is scheduled to testify before the House Armed Services Committee at the end of the month about the failure to notify officials. This time, notification came quickly from the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Austin was taken to the hospital at 2:20 p.m. Sunday, the Pentagon said. Within three hours, the Pentagon said notifications went out to the president, the Joints Chiefs chair and Congress. A subsequent statement said Austin had transferred his responsibilities to his deputy. And shortly before midnight, a third statement said Austin had been admitted to the critical care unit at Walter Reed. The rapid process of notification stands in marked contrast to Austin’s previous hospitalization. It took days for Austin’s office to notify senior administration officials, including Biden , that the defense secretary was in the hospital, and it took even longer to inform officials of Austin’s diagnosis with prostate cancer. Biden said in January that Austin had a lapse in judgement in not notifying the commander in chief about the diagnosis. Austin, in his first news conference after his initial hospitalization, said he directly apologized to the president and was “deeply sorry” for not letting him know. A 30-day review of the notification process was completed last week, but the Pentagon said most of it was classified. Austin said during his news conference that the Pentagon would share “as much as possible as soon as possible.” This story has been updated with additional details.","['us', 'defense', 'secretary', 'lloyd', 'austin', 'canceled', 'trip', 'brussels', 'nato', 'ukraine', 'meetings', 'later', 'week', 'remains', 'hospitalized', 'walter', 'reed', 'medical', 'center', 'according', 'defense', 'official', 'familiar', 'plans', 'austin', 'taken', 'hospital', 'sunday', 'afternoon', 'symptoms', '“suggesting', 'emergent', 'bladder', 'issue”', 'maj', 'gen', 'pat', 'ryder', 'pentagon', 'press', 'secretary', 'sunday', 'austin', 'admitted', 'hospital’s', 'critical', 'care', 'unit', 'later', 'evening', 'additional', 'care', 'close', 'monitoring', 'hospital', 'ryder', 'monday', 'austin', 'intensive', 'care', 'unit', '“in', 'order', 'provide', 'appropriate', 'privacy”', 'remain', 'duration', 'stay', 'austin’s', 'doctors', 'statement', 'monday', 'afternoon', 'austin', 'underwent', '“nonsurgical', 'procedures', 'general', 'anesthesia', 'address', 'bladder', 'issue”', '“we', 'anticipate', 'successful', 'recovery', 'closely', 'monitor', 'overnight”', 'statement', 'adding', 'austin’s', 'doctors', 'believe', 'able', 'resume', 'duties', 'defense', 'secretary', 'tuesday', 'still', 'unclear', 'long', 'austin', 'remain', 'hospital', 'according', 'medical', 'staff', 'though', 'doctors’', 'statement', 'anticipate', '“prolonged', 'hospital', 'stay”', 'austin', 'supposed', 'lead', 'meeting', 'ukraine', 'defense', 'contact', 'group', 'brussels', 'followed', 'meeting', 'nato', 'defense', 'ministerial', 'austin', 'attended', 'january', '23', 'meeting', 'udcg', 'virtually', 'home', 'week’s', 'meeting', 'udcg', 'held', 'virtually', 'sunday', 'afternoon', 'austin', 'transferred', 'duties', 'deputy', 'defense', 'secretary', 'kathleen', 'hicks', 'notifying', 'president', 'chairman', 'joint', 'chiefs', 'staff', 'congress', 'according', 'pentagon', 'ryder', 'monday', 'austin', 'represented', 'udcg', 'celeste', 'wallander', 'assistant', 'secretary', 'defense', 'international', 'security', 'affairs', 'nato', 'defense', 'ministerial', 'ambassador', 'julianne', 'smith', 'us', 'permanent', 'representative', 'nato', 'austin', 'faced', 'significant', 'criticism', 'failure', 'notify', 'senior', 'administration', 'officials', 'including', 'biden', 'previous', 'hospitalization', 'diagnosis', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'austin', 'scheduled', 'testify', 'house', 'armed', 'services', 'committee', 'end', 'month', 'failure', 'notify', 'officials', 'notification', 'came', 'quickly', 'office', 'secretary', 'defense', 'austin', 'taken', 'hospital', '220', 'pm', 'sunday', 'pentagon', 'within', 'three', 'hours', 'pentagon', 'notifications', 'went', 'president', 'joints', 'chiefs', 'chair', 'congress', 'subsequent', 'statement', 'austin', 'transferred', 'responsibilities', 'deputy', 'shortly', 'midnight', 'third', 'statement', 'austin', 'admitted', 'critical', 'care', 'unit', 'walter', 'reed', 'rapid', 'process', 'notification', 'stands', 'marked', 'contrast', 'austin’s', 'previous', 'hospitalization', 'took', 'days', 'austin’s', 'office', 'notify', 'senior', 'administration', 'officials', 'including', 'biden', 'defense', 'secretary', 'hospital', 'took', 'longer', 'inform', 'officials', 'austin’s', 'diagnosis', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'biden', 'january', 'austin', 'lapse', 'judgement', 'notifying', 'commander', 'chief', 'diagnosis', 'austin', 'first', 'conference', 'initial', 'hospitalization', 'directly', 'apologized', 'president', '“deeply', 'sorry”', 'letting', 'know', '30day', 'review', 'notification', 'process', 'completed', 'last', 'week', 'pentagon', 'classified', 'austin', 'conference', 'pentagon', 'share', '“as', 'much', 'possible', 'soon', 'possible”', 'updated', 'additional', 'details']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/politics/new-york-democrats-special-election-3rd-district/index.html,"Plainview, NewYork CNN — How bad were the 2022 midterm elections for Democrat in NewYork? One way to explain it: Republican George Santos ’ victory in the state’s 3rd Congressional District might have been the highlight of their year. Santos’ troubles began in earnest six weeks after his surprising win, and after a year of scandal and outrage that sullied and undermined leading local Republican, he was gone – one of only six members to have been bounced from the House and only the third since the Civil War – and the seat was open. Democrat would get another bite at the apple. But as the special election to succeed the disgraced former congressman has made painfully clear to Democrat, Santos’ victory was not a fluke or anomaly. What had been a safely blue suburban Long Island seat for most of the past three decades is, once again, shaping up to be a political battleground. Days out now from Tuesday’s expensive and fiercely contested matchup between Democrat Tom Suozzi, 61, a former House member and a staple of Nassau County politics since first being elected mayor of Glen Cove in 1993, against little-known Mazi Pilip, a 44-year-old Ethiopian-born, Israeli American county legislator, the race is widely considered a toss-up. Suozzi’s brand is still strong; he ran the county during some of its best economic times, before his first election to Congress in 2016. But Pilip, though her ideological bearings remain fuzzy and she has been at times hard to find on the campaign trail, has the prevailing political winds at her back – and the opportunity to both put a stamp on the GOP’s restored primacy on Long Island and emerge as an up-and-coming national figure ahead of the fall’s general election. Ten or 15 years ago, the political dynamics currently roiling the NewYork suburbs might have seemed as far-fetched as Santos’ claims to a career as a Broadway producer. But cascading crises, from a home-building and affordability crisis to more recent panic over crime and immigration, have swung back the pendulum. Nassau County in 2024 is sharply divided and – in a word – angry. It’s a lot like other places across the country that could determine Biden’s fate in his expected November rematch with former Trump. “Long Island is running hot, and when people run hot, they run Republican,” said Alyssa Cass, a Democrat strategist. “George Santos was not an accident. His election was the direct result of years and years of careful Republican recruitment, party building and outreach in Long Island.” Democrat on the brink, and Republican on the rise Though the district broke for Biden over Trump by 8 points in 2020, the signs of a Republican renaissance – and diminishing returns from a disjointed Democrat state party – were soon to come on display. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer lost the county while otherwise cruising to reelection in 2022. The year before, Democrat Laura Curran, the top official in Nassau County, was ousted by Republican Bruce Blakeman. GOP gains continued into 2023 – well after the Santos fiasco was in full flight – and Republican are now close to dominant in local offices. WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 01: Rep. George Santos is surrounded by journalists as he leaves the U.S. Capitol after his fellow members of Congress voted to expel him from the House of Representatives on December 01, 2023 in Washington, DC. Charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with 23 felonies in NewYork including fraud and campaign finance violations, Santos, 35, was expelled from the House of Representatives by a vote of 311-114. Santos is only the sixth person in U.S. history to be expelled from the House of Representatives. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Related article What the race to replace Santos will tell us about the 2024 election Tuesday’s special election, though, is unique in a number of ways. Where NewYork Democrat garnered little national attention in 2022 – until their slew of losses in suburban seats across the state helped the GOP win control of the House – the party is full throttle behind Suozzi this time out. It also helps that Brooklyn’s Hakeem Jeffries is now the top House Democrat. “Hakeem is a beast – for better or for worse,” said one progressive Democrat operative, who spoke anonymously because of the delicate nature of intrastate politics. “I appreciate the fact that he’s realized that, if you leave the race in the state party’s hands, we’re all going down.” NewYork state and Nassau County Democrat Chairman Jay Jacobs, who rejected calls to resign after the Santos debacle, praised Jeffries and his leadership team for their support – particularly when it’s come to campaign cash – but also suggested that, back in 2022, the local party suffered as much for a lack of interest from national Democrat as their own missteps. “Everybody’s paying attention, where they really weren’t and we were on our own the last time,” Jacobs told CNN. “The county organization did its job last time. It’s doing its job this time. No Democrat voter is going tell you they didn’t hear from the party.” Still, questions remain about the recent Democrat failures, most notable on the island, but also across the state. “Historically, there has never really been a strong party infrastructure here because the state party was just the governor’s thing,” Curran told CNN. “He could boss it around and tell it what to do. So there’s not a machine, there’s not a real boots-on-the-ground operation.” It’s been a different story this campaign. Grassroots progressive groups like Engage Long Island, which is part of the Indivisible network, have been feverishly knocking on doors – taking their case directly to like-minded neighbors. And Suozzi has massively outraised Pilip, taking in $4.5 million to her $1.3 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings that cover the beginning of October through January 24 of this year. Curran, a centrist ally of Suozzi, doesn’t blame former Gov. Andrew Cuomo or Jacobs for the state party’s failures – her ire is directed at leftist Democrat in NewYork City Hall and the state Legislature. But more liberal NewYork Democrat often point to the current problems as Cuomo’s legacy. And even with Cuomo gone, Jacobs is now, again, a trusted ally of the governor, Democrat Kathy Hochul, who clinched a full term in 2022 – but only by a little more than 6 points. Suozzi, Curran and others said the special election might be Democrat’ last best hope to stop Long Island’s red tide from surging further, noting Suozzi’s name recognition and personal political brand – a straight-talking, go-everywhere moderate – in comparison with Pilip’s aversion to gladhanding on the trail. Nassau County Legislator Mazi Pilip, seen here with former NewYork Rep. Peter King, right, arrives to cast her ballot during early voting in Massapequa, NewYork, on February 9, 2024. Adam Gray/Bloomberg/Getty Images “Here’s someone who has proven that he can fix the problem and wants to fix the problem. But is that what people are looking for right now, or are they just so mad at the Democrat that they’re not listening?” Curran said of Suozzi and district voter. “Honestly, Tom is the one who can win this race – if a Democrat can win it.” Larry Levy, a former local journalist who is now the executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University, offered the same mixed blessing to Suozzi and Nassau County Democrat. “The outcome will be a measure of how the Democrat brand can affect races all over the country,” Levy said. “If Suozzi can’t withstand the damage the Democrat Party has sustained over inflation, Israel and immigration, then I’m not sure who could.” In an interview with CNN, Nassau County GOP leader Joe Cairo agreed that Suozzi has a unique brand but said the former mayor, county executive and congressman’s long record in office cuts both ways. “Tom Suozzi on his signs, he’s saying, ‘Let’s fix it.’ Well, who broke it, Tom?” Cairo said. “You were in Congress.” Hot button issues such as the migrant influx, mixed in with the fight over abortion rights and a housing and cost-of-living crisis on Long Island, have driven a special election campaign that has seen the airwaves dominated by ads and mailboxes stuffed, almost daily, with campaign literature from both parties. Though no single contest – much less an almost pop-up special election conducted under unusual circumstances – can claim to foretell what comes next in national politics, “Suozzi vs. Mazi” comes awfully close. In a nod to the dim views of Democrat and Republican in this swing district, neither Suozzi nor Pilip advertise their party affiliation on the thousands of lawn signs now staked out across the district. Pilip initially refused to say who she voted for in 2020, before eventually telling the NewYork Post over the weekend that she “proudly” cast her ballot for Trump. In sum, Nassau County looks a lot like the suburban areas around the country that are expected to play an outsize role in determining the 2024 presidential race. “You’ll hear from Democrat, if they lose, that this really isn’t a bellwether because Nassau County has been an outlier nationally,” Levy said. But, he added, while nothing is certain, “the reality is that the issues are going be the same, whether it’s … Montgomery and Bucks counties in Pennsylvania or Oakland County, Michigan.” What distinguishes Nassau County from some of those other traditional battlegrounds is its proximity to America’s biggest city, where political moods tend to filter out into the suburbs and, in recent years, concerns over public safety and, more recently, a growing migrant housing crisis are dominating the headlines. “We look west and we see what’s happening in NewYork City, whether it is crime, migration, affordability issues. Even if it’s not here in our backyards, because we live off of NewYork City, basically,” said Mike Florio, a former top Suozzi staffer in Congress turned CEO of the Long Islanders Builders Institute. “What the Republican are able to do is tie the issues you see in NewYork City and say, ‘If you go with the Democrat who control NewYork City, you know, we can end up like that.’” Some of the asylum-seeking migrants whose presence has scrambled local politics are currently living in a relief center near the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, which sits inside the 3rd District’s borders. During their Thursday night debate, Pilip – as she’s done in commercials and mailers – claimed Suozzi, who represented the district from 2017 to 2023, and Biden were responsible for the mess. In this screengrab from video, candidates for NewYork's 3rd congressional district Mazi Pilip and Tom Suozzi square off at a town hall style debate hosted by News 12’s Rich Barrabi just days before the special election for George Santos’ vacant House seat on Thursday, February 8, 2024. News 12 Long Island Related article Takeaways from the NewYork special election debate “Tom Suozzi opened the border. Tom Suozzi funded the sanctuary city. Tom Suozzi kicked ICE from Nassau County,” she said, before addressing Suozzi directly: “You have to own it.” For his part, Suozzi has sought to brush off the attacks as absurd. His fight with ICE, he said, came at the behest of a police chief whose officers clashed with ICE agents more than 15 years ago during his time as county executive. The broader thrust of similar attacks, he said early on in the debate, was not credible. “For you to suggest I’m a member of ‘the squad’ is about as believable as you being a member of George Santos’ volleyball team,” Suozzi said to some laughter in the hall. In fact, Suozzi did once express affinity for “squad” members – an informal coteries of House progressives – though not in the context Pilip and other Republican have described. Suozzi made the remark in 2019, shortly after then-Trump said Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib – all of whom are American citizens – should “go back” to their countries. “I don’t agree with all the politics of the squad. I’m a Democrat. I don’t agree with a lot of their politics,” he said that summer. “But today, I want to be an honorary member of ‘the squad.’ Because I want to fight against this un-American, racist type of behavior.” Suozzi, too, has sought to lump in Pilip with more divisive characters, including Santos. On Thursday night, he called her “unprepared and unvetted” and then sought, during a tense and protracted exchange, to get her to explain contradictory positions on abortion and gun laws. Pilip says “every woman should have that choice to make their decision” but also calls herself “pro-life.” She opposes both a national ban on abortion and the codification of Roe v. Wade, backing the SupremeCourt’s Dobbs decision and saying that the issue should be decided at the state level. Pilip has also said “automatic weapons” should be banned – which they are – but does not support a new assault weapons ban, which would outlaw firearms such as the semi-automatic AR-15. Suozzi also zeroed in on Pilip’s rejection of the bipartisan border security deal, hatched in the Senate, as a cop-out to Trump, who denounced it. “We finally have a chance to have a solution,” Suozzi said, “but we’re not going to do it because Trump said it’ll help Biden?” Nerves, not excitement, among voter On the ground in Nassau County, though, there is less talk about the nitty-gritty of the issues and more of a prevailing dissatisfaction with both parties and their leaders – even a candidate like Suozzi whom they know and mostly like. Jim Fornaro, 66, a local resident and former registered Democrat who once backed Suozzi and still calls him “a great guy,” told CNN on Thursday that he plans to vote for Pilip this week. “A lot of things in the country, in my opinion, aren’t going in the proper direction. So another person who vote with Biden 100%, I don’t look at it,” Fornaro said. “I’m really voting against Suozzi.” Others are planning to sit out the election, bummed over the choices. “Suozzi has shown for a long time who he is – just a bureaucrat. And Mazi, I don’t know,” said Nestor Oginar, a Macedonian-born former professor and Republican who doesn’t intend to vote. “I think she’s a newcomer, so we don’t know what she is. But I think she’s pandering to certain groups of.” Though Santos rarely comes up in conversations with voter, his saga enraged rank-and-file Long Island Democrat, who had previously spent time writing post cards to encourage voter in states like North Carolina. Now, that mail is landing here. Suozzi canvassers Rachel Klein, 44, and Stephanie Visconti, 47, leaders with Engage Long Island, told CNN that Suozzi might not have been their first choice – but the stakes, at home and with the whole country watching, are too steep for hair-splitting. “I hope Democrat have learned like what it’s like to not have representation and how important it is to flip this seat back so that they’ll show up,” Klein said Thursday, after a morning canvassing here and in New Hyde Park. “But I guess we’ll see on Tuesday.” Visconti’s message was similarly pragmatic. “I definitely am left of his center,” she said of Suozzi, but his election to a closely divided Congress would have one main upside for her. “We’d be one step closer to having Hakeem Jeffries be our speaker,” Visconti said, “of flipping and moving forward as a nation.” Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Stephanie Visconti's last name.","['plainview', 'newyork', 'bad', '2022', 'midterm',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/white-house-tiktok-policy-biden-campaign/index.html,"The White House on Monday said there are no changes regarding the administration’s long-standing security concerns over TikTok after the Biden made his campaign debut on the platform Sunday night. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday the ban on the platform’s use on government devices “remains the case today.” He referred questions over the video to the president’s reelection campaign, which posted it. “I don’t want to get into too much of the national security, technical reasons behind that, but it does have to do with concerns about the preservation of data and the potential misuse of that data and privacy information by foreign actors,” Kirby told reporters. In a follow-up exchange with Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary said she was not aware the campaign planned to launch a TikTok account ahead of Sunday. “No – I am very, very careful, as the White House press secretary … and so I do not communicate with the campaign on any strategy or anything like that. … I did not know; I knew as you all did,” she said. In the TikTok, which was posted during the Super Bowl matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, Biden answered a series of light-hearted Super Bowl-themed questions. Asked to choose between the game and commercials, Biden picked the game. He responded “Mama Kelce” when asked to choose between Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and his brother, Jason, who plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. Biden jokingly said he would “get in trouble if I told you” when asked whether he rigged the game for the Chiefs, referencing a popular conspiracy theory involving Travis Kelce’s girlfriend, superstar musician Taylor Swift. And in the final round of questioning of “Trump or Biden,” he laughed and replied, “Are you kidding? Biden.” The TikTok debut was just one effort made by the campaign to dip its toes into meme culture and court young voter Sunday night. Following the Chiefs’ 25-22 overtime win, Biden campaign posted a “Dark Brandon” meme with the caption: “Just like we drew it up,” referencing the conspiracy theory that the Biden administration worked in tandem with Swift to rig the game and swing the 2024 election in Biden favor. But there are security concerns around the popular video app, which is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese technology company. TikTok doesn’t operate in China, but since the Chinese government enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, the theory goes that ByteDance – and thus indirectly, TikTok – could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities, including possibly the transfer of TikTok data. The US government has said it’s worried China could use its national security laws to access the significant amount of personal information that TikTok, like most social media applications, collects from its US users. To date, the US government has provided no specific evidence that the Chinese government has accessed US TikTok user data. TikTok has moved to consolidate US user data on US soil through a program it calls Project Texas. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have been somewhat aligned on their national security concerns pertaining to TikTok. During his administration, Trump threatened to ban the platform if it did not divest from its Chinese owners. In 2022, Biden signed legislation prohibiting TikTok on federal government devices. The Biden campaign will take “advanced safety precautions” with its devices and will incorporate a “sophisticated security protocol to ensure security,” a campaign adviser said, while noting the “campaign’s presence is independent and apart from the ongoing” Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States review into TikTok .","['white', 'house', 'monday', 'changes', 'regarding', 'administration’s', 'longstanding', 'security', 'concerns', 'tiktok', 'biden', 'made', 'campaign', 'debut', 'platform', 'sunday', 'night', 'national', 'security', 'council', 'spokesman', 'john', 'kirby', 'reporters', 'monday', 'ban', 'platform’s', 'use', 'government', 'devices', '“remains', 'case', 'today”', 'referred', 'questions', 'video', 'president’s', 'reelection', 'campaign', 'posted', 'don’t', 'want', 'much', 'national', 'security', 'technical', 'reasons', 'behind', 'concerns', 'preservation', 'data', 'potential', 'misuse', 'data', 'privacy', 'information', 'foreign', 'actors”', 'kirby', 'reporters', 'followup', 'exchange', 'karine', 'jeanpierre', 'white', 'house', 'press', 'secretary', 'aware', 'campaign', 'planned', 'launch', 'tiktok', 'account', 'ahead', 'sunday', '“no', 'careful', 'white', 'house', 'press', 'secretary', '…', 'communicate', 'campaign', 'strategy', 'anything', 'like', '…', 'know', 'knew', 'did”', 'tiktok', 'posted', 'super', 'bowl', 'matchup', 'kansas', 'city', 'chiefs', 'san', 'francisco', '49ers', 'biden', 'answered', 'series', 'lighthearted', 'super', 'bowlthemed', 'questions', 'asked', 'choose', 'game', 'commercials', 'biden', 'picked', 'game', 'responded', '“mama', 'kelce”', 'asked', 'choose', 'chiefs', 'tight', 'end', 'travis', 'kelce', 'brother', 'jason', 'plays', 'philadelphia', 'eagles', 'biden', 'jokingly', '“get', 'trouble', 'you”', 'asked', 'whether', 'rigged', 'game', 'chiefs', 'referencing', 'popular', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'involving', 'travis', 'kelce’s', 'girlfriend', 'superstar', 'musician', 'taylor', 'swift', 'final', 'round', 'questioning', '“trump', 'biden”', 'laughed', 'replied', '“are', 'kidding', 'biden”', 'tiktok', 'debut', 'one', 'effort', 'made', 'campaign', 'dip', 'toes', 'meme', 'culture', 'court', 'young', 'voter', 'sunday', 'night', 'following', 'chiefs’', '2522', 'overtime', 'win', 'biden', 'campaign', 'posted', '“dark', 'brandon”', 'meme', 'caption', '“just', 'like', 'drew', 'up”', 'referencing', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'biden', 'administration', 'worked', 'tandem', 'swift', 'rig', 'game', 'swing', '2024', 'election', 'biden', 'favor', 'security', 'concerns', 'around', 'popular', 'video', 'app', 'owned', 'bytedance', 'chinese', 'technology', 'company', 'tiktok', 'doesn’t', 'operate', 'china', 'since', 'chinese', 'government', 'enjoys', 'significant', 'leverage', 'businesses', 'jurisdiction', 'theory', 'goes', 'bytedance', 'thus', 'indirectly', 'tiktok', 'forced', 'cooperate', 'broad', 'range', 'security', 'activities', 'including', 'possibly', 'transfer', 'tiktok', 'data', 'us', 'government', 'worried', 'china', 'use', 'national', 'security', 'laws', 'access', 'significant', 'amount', 'personal', 'information', 'tiktok', 'like', 'social', 'media', 'applications', 'collects', 'us', 'users', 'date', 'us', 'government', 'provided', 'specific', 'evidence', 'chinese', 'government', 'accessed', 'us', 'tiktok', 'user', 'data', 'tiktok', 'moved', 'consolidate', 'us', 'user', 'data', 'us', 'soil', 'program', 'calls', 'project', 'texas', 'trump', 'biden', 'administrations', 'somewhat', 'aligned', 'national', 'security', 'concerns', 'pertaining', 'tiktok', 'administration', 'trump', 'threatened', 'ban', 'platform', 'divest', 'chinese', 'owners', '2022', 'biden', 'signed', 'legislation', 'prohibiting', 'tiktok', 'federal', 'government', 'devices', 'biden', 'campaign', 'take', '“advanced', 'safety', 'precautions”', 'devices', 'incorporate', '“sophisticated', 'security', 'protocol', 'ensure', 'security”', 'campaign', 'adviser', 'noting', '“campaign’s', 'presence', 'independent', 'apart', 'ongoing”', 'committee', 'foreign', 'investment', 'united', 'states', 'review', 'tiktok', '']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/jamie-raskin-letter-comer-witness/index.html,"The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, raised serious questions about a key witness in the impeachment inquiry of Biden in a letter to Oversight Chairman James Comer provided first to CNN. Raskin wrote that Tony Bobulinski, a business associate of the Biden family who is expected to be interviewed on Tuesday as part of the Republican-led investigation, presents “giant red flags” and called on Comer to bring in other Trump administration and campaign officials to corroborate any testimony he provides. Bobulinski alleged in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election that Biden profited from his son’s business deals, which former Trump and his allies seized on. In the letter, Raskin asks Comer to bring in some of those allies for interviews, including Trump former chief of staff Mark Meadows, Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann and Trump advisers Arthur Schwartz and Jason Miller. But other witnesses close to Bobulinski and the Biden family have refuted Bobulinski’s claims. Biden business associate Rob Walker told the FBI in 2020 that Bobulinski’s claims about Biden involvement was “wishful thinking” and agreed with agents who comparied Bobulinski’s claims to “unicorns and rainbows.” Walker recently testified to House Republican that Biden “while in office or as a private citizen, was never involved in any business activities we pursued,” according to excerpts of his testimony provided to CNN. Another associate to the Biden family, James Gillar, who was on an email chain Bobulinski was using as evidence, told the Wall Street Journal when Bobulinski’s allegations were made, “I am unaware of any involvement at any time of the former vice president.” Raskin also raised issue with Bobulinski’s lack of cooperation with Democrat on the Oversight Committee, and questioned the materials he turned over as “cherry-picked and selective information.” A House Oversight Committee spokesperson told CNN that Raskin’s concerns about Bobulinski are “beyond parody” and accused Democrat of “engaging in witness intimidation.” CNN has reached out to Bobulinski for response to Raskin’s letter. Comer meanwhile has praised Bobulinski and described him as “of all of the guys that were involved in the HunterBiden orbit, Tony Bobulinski appears to me to be the one solid guy that tried to do the right thing and was honest.” The committee requested to speak with Bobulinski to learn about what “firsthand knowledge” he had. Raskin’s letter to Comer comes shortly after House Oversight Democrat released a new memo that shows none of the last seven witnesses interviewed as part of Republican’s impeachment inquiry have said there was any evidence of wrongdoing by the president. The report includes excerpts from each interview and offers a serious blow to Republican who have been struggling to build momentum on their inquiry and openly questioning whether it will result in impeachment. “Each witness stated they were not aware of any evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden or of Biden being involved in, profiting from, or taking official actions in relation to family members’ business ventures” the report from Democrat staff reads. “Further, not one of these witnesses indicated they ever had any expectation of receiving or ever did receive any political favors from Biden or his Administration.”","['top', 'democrat', 'house', 'oversight', 'committee', 'rep', 'jamie', 'raskin', 'maryland', 'raised', 'serious', 'questions', 'key', 'witness', 'impeachment', 'inquiry', 'biden', 'letter', 'oversight', 'chairman', 'james', 'comer', 'provided', 'first', 'raskin', 'wrote', 'tony', 'bobulinski', 'business', 'associate', 'biden', 'family', 'expected', 'interviewed', 'tuesday', 'part', 'republicanled', 'investigation', 'presents', '“giant', 'red', 'flags”', 'called', 'comer', 'bring', 'trump', 'administration', 'campaign', 'officials', 'corroborate', 'testimony', 'provides', 'bobulinski', 'alleged', 'leadup', '2020', 'presidential', 'election', 'biden', 'profited', 'son’s', 'business', 'deals', 'trump', 'allies', 'seized', 'letter', 'raskin', 'asks', 'comer', 'bring', 'allies', 'interviews', 'including', 'trump', 'chief', 'staff', 'mark', 'meadows', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'lawyer', 'eric', 'herschmann', 'trump', 'advisers', 'arthur', 'schwartz', 'jason', 'miller', 'witnesses', 'close', 'bobulinski', 'biden', 'family', 'refuted', 'bobulinski’s', 'claims', 'biden', 'business', 'associate', 'rob', 'walker', 'fbi', '2020', 'bobulinski’s', 'claims', 'biden', 'involvement', '“wishful', 'thinking”', 'agreed', 'agents', 'comparied', 'bobulinski’s', 'claims', '“unicorns', 'rainbows”', 'walker', 'recently', 'testified', 'house', 'republican', 'biden', '“while', 'office', 'private', 'citizen', 'never', 'involved', 'business', 'activities', 'pursued”', 'according', 'excerpts', 'testimony', 'provided', 'another', 'associate', 'biden', 'family', 'james', 'gillar', 'email', 'chain', 'bobulinski', 'using', 'evidence', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'bobulinski’s', 'allegations', 'made', 'unaware', 'involvement', 'vice', 'president”', 'raskin', 'raised', 'issue', 'bobulinski’s', 'lack', 'cooperation', 'democrat', 'oversight', 'committee', 'questioned', 'materials', 'turned', '“cherrypicked', 'selective', 'information”', 'house', 'oversight', 'committee', 'spokesperson', 'raskin’s', 'concerns', 'bobulinski', '“beyond', 'parody”', 'accused', 'democrat', '“engaging', 'witness', 'intimidation”', 'reached', 'bobulinski', 'response', 'raskin’s', 'letter', 'comer', 'meanwhile', 'praised', 'bobulinski', 'described', '“of', 'guys', 'involved', 'hunterbiden', 'orbit', 'tony', 'bobulinski', 'appears', 'one', 'solid', 'guy', 'tried', 'right', 'thing', 'honest”', 'committee', 'requested', 'speak', 'bobulinski', 'learn', '“firsthand', 'knowledge”', 'raskin’s', 'letter', 'comer', 'comes', 'shortly', 'house', 'oversight', 'democrat', 'released', 'new', 'memo', 'shows', 'none', 'last', 'seven', 'witnesses', 'interviewed', 'part', 'republican’s', 'impeachment', 'inquiry', 'evidence', 'wrongdoing', 'president', 'report', 'includes', 'excerpts', 'interview', 'offers', 'serious', 'blow', 'republican', 'struggling', 'build', 'momentum', 'inquiry', 'openly', 'questioning', 'whether', 'result', 'impeachment', '“each', 'witness', 'stated', 'aware', 'evidence', 'wrongdoing', 'biden', 'biden', 'involved', 'profiting', 'taking', 'official', 'actions', 'relation', 'family', 'members’', 'business', 'ventures”', 'report', 'democrat', 'staff', 'reads', '“further', 'one', 'witnesses', 'indicated', 'ever', 'expectation', 'receiving', 'ever', 'receive', 'political', 'favors', 'biden', 'administration”']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-smith-mar-a-lago-documents-case/index.html,"The classified documents criminal case against Trump and others is heating up again Monday with crucial hearings over access to evidence that could impact whether the former president is tried before the November election. Trump arrived at the federal courthouse Monday morning in Fort Pierce, Florida, for a closed-door hearing with Judge Aileen Cannon without prosecutors present to discuss the case “in detail.” Trump left the courthouse shortly after 2 p.m. ET, waving to a crowd from his car. Special counsel Jack Smith’s team is scheduled to meet with Cannon Monday afternoon. Neither hearing is open to the public. The defense lawyers will argue for access to classified evidence in the case they or their clients haven’t yet seen – and that prosecutors and intelligence agencies seek to keep from them, potentially giving them only summaries of the information because of how sensitive it is, according to the court record. While many of the Mar-a-Lago documents case proceedings and filings have been kept out of the public’s view in recent weeks, the prosecutors and defense teams have been preparing for trial. The defense teams have been furiously at work over the past several days – including on Super Bowl Sunday – preparing for the hearing Monday, writing motions and reviewing evidence in a sensitive compartmented information facility, called a SCIF, in Florida, according to multiple sources familiar with the team. In addition to the hearing, they face a major deadline for court filings in less than two weeks, as they continue to strategize for ways to delay the trial. They are also fighting with prosecutors over making witness names public now, well before the trial. Court cases with classified evidence such as this require careful oversight by the judge to make sure defense teams can access evidence they need to prepare for trial while protecting the federal government’s national security secrets. That sometimes prompts extended court proceedings to determine which pieces of classified evidence defense lawyers and even defendants can see. In Trump case, the complexities of the case, the multiple defendants, and the number of classified records that are part of the evidence could lead to delays. A March 1 hearing with Cannon is expected to address whether the trial can go forward in May as scheduled. The Justice Department previously said what it seeks to keep from Trump co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira amounts to at least 5,500 pages – some of which their lawyers, Trump and his defense team already can work through in a SCIF. The records being kept from the co-defendants are largely the documents with classified markings found in boxes at Mar-a-Lago by the FBI in August 2022, according to court filings. Lawyers for Nauta and De Oliveira have argued they should get more access so they can “meaningfully discuss the viability” of their defenses, a matter that is likely to be discussed in the sealed proceeding Monday. A smaller group of records is also being kept from Trump and his lawyers because of the federal government’s national security sensitivities. Cannon has already heard arguments in person from the special counsel’s office once and has seen sworn statements from intelligence agencies on the need to keep some records secret even from the defense teams. At a later date, Cannon will have to decide which pieces of evidence are necessary to use during a public trial and how that information can be presented. Debate over witness safety and delays The tensions in the Mar-a-Lago case extend beyond the defense teams’ access to evidence. The special counsel’s office is seeking to keep secret from the public names of witnesses who could be called to testify against Trump at trial, saying witnesses could be harassed. An aerial view of former Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate is seen on August 10, 2022, in Palm Beach, Florida. Steve Helber/AP/File Related article Special counsel details threats against witnesses in Mar-a-Lago case in effort to protect their identities Those witnesses include government personnel from the National Archives, more than 20 FBI agents who were at the search of Mar-a-Lago, people who had relationships with Trump and his co-defendants, and other career civil servants. Smith cited myriad threats against judges, prosecutors and witnesses, including one threat toward a witness on social media that is the subject of a federal criminal investigation. Though scant information is public about the closed-door fights between Trump, his co-defendants and the special counsel, the former president has made clear that he believes the drama about discovery and classified information should delay the trial’s scheduled start date in May. Trump attempt to delay the trial underpins several of his recent moves in court. Smith made clear his frustration with these attempts, writing in a court filing recently that the defense “will stop at nothing to stall the adjudication of the charges against them by a fair and impartial jury of citizens.” Smith alleged Trump is using a series of legal challenges the former president’s team said they plan to file as part of his efforts to delay the trial. Several major filings are due from the defense on February 22, largely as they attempt to cut out portions of the charges or have the case dismissed. But the defense team wants some of those filings to come in later, saying they will rely on Cannon’s decision over their access to classified records. This story has been updated with additional developments.","['classified', 'documents', 'criminal', 'case', 'trump', 'others', 'heating', 'monday', 'crucial', 'hearings', 'access', 'evidence',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/us-out-nato-second-trump-term-former-senior-adviser/index.html,"As US allies reel from Trump weekend comments encouraging Russia to attack European allies if they don’t meet NATO budget contribution goals, multiple former Trump advisers warn in my upcoming book that the former president will seek to formally withdraw the US from the NATO alliance if he wins a second term. In “The Return of Great Powers”, which will be published March 12, a former senior US official, who served in both the Trump and Biden administrations at a high level, told me that if Trump defeats Biden in November “the US will be out of NATO.” “NATO would be in real jeopardy,” John Bolton, Trump former national security adviser, agreed. “I think he would try to get out.” Trump disparagement of US security commitments extends to its mutual defense agreements with South Korea and Japan as well, retired General John Kelly, who served as White House chief of staff to Trump, told me. “The point is, he saw absolutely no point in NATO,” Kelly said in the book. “He was just dead set against having troops in South Korea, again, a deterrent force, or having troops in Japan, a deterrent force.” “He thought Putin was an okay guy and Kim was an okay guy ­that we had pushed North Korea into a corner,” Kelly recalled. “To him, it was like we were goading these guys. ‘If we didn’t have NATO, then Putin wouldn’t be doing these things.’” Senior members of the administration I spoke to for the book also detailed how Trump came close to withdrawing the US from the alliance, which is a key bedrock of Western security against Russia, in his first term and warn he is likely to go further in a second. “Democrat and media pearl-clutchers seem to have forgotten that we had four years of peace and prosperity under Trump, but Europe saw death and destruction under Obama-Biden and now more death and destruction under Biden,” Trump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller told CNN. “Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up, but Biden went back to letting them take advantage of the American taxpayer. When you don’t pay your defense spending you can’t be surprised that you get more war.” Video Ad Feedback White House responds to what Trump said about NATO countries and Russia 01:54 - Source: CNN Trump 2018 near NATO exit At the core of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty is the promise of collective defense — that an attack on one member nation is an attack on all the nations in the alliance. Trump has long complained about the amount NATO members spend on defense compared with the US. In “The Return of Great Powers,” multiple advisors recount in detail how Trump very nearly removed the US from NATO at the alliance’s 2018 summit in Brussels. “He was always ranting and raving and jumping up and down, and oftentimes he would spin up in terms of, ‘Well, I’m smarter than they are,’ and all of this,” Kelly said, describing Trump mindset in Brussels. Kelly said he tried to explain the importance of NATO to Trump in terms he believed the president would understand. Kelly’s approach involved a combination of explaining what was actually possible and what might make him look bad. In the case of withdrawing from NATO, Kelly tried to convey to Trump that both applied. But at the summit, Trump persisted. A former senior US official told me that Trump issued orders to then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley and then Defense Secretary Mark Esper for the US to withdraw from NATO. Despite vehemently opposing the move. They considered the president’s direction a “lawful order” and drew up plans to execute the withdrawal. Bolton recalls the 2018 summit with genuine fear. “Honest to God, it was frightening because we didn’t know what he was going to do up until the last minute. And I mean, I think, he all but said he was going to get out of NATO and then pulled back on it,” said Bolton. Other potential Trump targets Many veterans of the Trump administration have a similar warning for Ukraine. “US support for Ukraine would end,” said the senior US official who served under Trump and Biden. Noting Trump comment at a Fox News town hall in July 2023 claiming, if reelected as president, he could end the war in one day, Bolton said, “If I were Ukraine, I’d be very worried, because if everything is a deal, then ‘what’s another ten percent of Ukrainian territory if it brings peace?’ kind of thing.” US support for Taiwan, they say, would also be in jeopardy. Bolton recalled a stunt Trump would carry out in the Oval Office. “He would hold up the tip of his Sharpie pen and say, ‘That’s Taiwan. See this Resolute Desk, that’s China.’” His point, according to Bolton, is that Taiwan is too small to successfully defend itself against a Chinese invasion— ­ and too small for the US to care. Bolton recalled, “I mean, if I were in Taiwan, I would be very worried about a Trump administration.”","['us', 'allies', 'reel', 'trump', 'weekend', 'comments', 'encouraging', 'russia', 'attack', 'european', 'allies', 'don’t', 'meet', 'nato', 'budget', 'contribution', 'goals', 'multiple', 'trump', 'advisers', 'warn', 'upcoming', 'book', 'president', 'seek', 'formally', 'withdraw', 'us', 'nato', 'alliance', 'wins', 'second', 'term', '“the', 'return', 'great', 'powers”', 'published', 'march', '12', 'senior', 'us', 'official', 'served', 'trump', 'biden', 'administrations', 'high', 'level', 'trump', 'defeats', 'biden', 'november', '“the', 'us', 'nato”', '“nato', 'real', 'jeopardy”', 'john', 'bolton', 'trump', 'national', 'security', 'adviser', 'agreed', 'try', 'out”', 'trump', 'disparagement', 'us', 'security', 'commitments', 'extends', 'mutual', 'defense', 'agreements', 'south', 'korea', 'japan', 'well', 'retired', 'general', 'john', 'kelly', 'served', 'white', 'house', 'chief', 'staff', 'trump', '“the', 'point', 'saw', 'absolutely', 'point', 'nato”', 'kelly', 'book', '“he', 'dead', 'set', 'troops', 'south', 'korea', 'deterrent', 'force', 'troops', 'japan', 'deterrent', 'force”', '“he', 'thought', 'putin', 'okay', 'guy', 'kim', 'okay', 'guy', '\xadthat', 'pushed', 'north', 'korea', 'corner”', 'kelly', 'recalled', '“to', 'like', 'goading', 'guys', '‘if', 'didn’t', 'nato', 'putin', 'wouldn’t', 'things’”', 'senior', 'members', 'administration', 'spoke', 'book', 'detailed', 'trump', 'came', 'close', 'withdrawing', 'us', 'alliance', 'key', 'bedrock', 'western', 'security', 'russia', 'first', 'term', 'warn', 'likely', 'go', 'second', '“democrat', 'media', 'pearlclutchers', 'seem', 'forgotten', 'four', 'years', 'peace', 'prosperity', 'trump', 'europe', 'saw', 'death', 'destruction', 'obamabiden', 'death', 'destruction', 'biden”', 'trump', 'campaign', 'spokesperson', 'jason', 'miller', '“trump', 'got', 'allies', 'increase', 'nato', 'spending', 'demanding', 'pay', 'biden', 'went', 'back', 'letting', 'take', 'advantage', 'american', 'taxpayer', 'don’t', 'pay', 'defense', 'spending', 'can’t', 'surprised', 'war”', 'video', 'ad', 'feedback', 'white', 'house', 'responds', 'trump', 'nato', 'countries', 'russia', '0154', 'source', 'trump', '2018', 'near', 'nato', 'exit', 'core', 'north', 'atlantic', 'treaty', 'organization', 'enshrined', 'article', '5', 'treaty', 'promise', 'collective', 'defense', 'attack', 'one', 'member', 'nation', 'attack', 'nations', 'alliance', 'trump', 'long', 'complained', 'amount', 'nato', 'members', 'spend', 'defense', 'compared', 'us', '“the', 'return', 'great', 'powers”', 'multiple', 'advisors', 'recount', 'detail', 'trump', 'nearly', 'removed', 'us', 'nato', 'alliance’s', '2018', 'summit', 'brussels', '“he', 'always', 'ranting', 'raving', 'jumping', 'oftentimes', 'spin', 'terms', '‘well', 'i’m', 'smarter', 'are’', 'this”', 'kelly', 'describing', 'trump', 'mindset', 'brussels', 'kelly', 'tried', 'explain', 'importance', 'nato', 'trump', 'terms', 'believed', 'president', 'understand', 'kelly’s', 'approach', 'involved', 'combination', 'explaining', 'actually', 'possible', 'might', 'make', 'look', 'bad', 'case', 'withdrawing', 'nato', 'kelly', 'tried', 'convey', 'trump', 'applied', 'summit', 'trump', 'persisted', 'senior', 'us', 'official', 'trump', 'issued', 'orders', 'chairman', 'joint', 'chiefs', 'staff', 'general', 'mark', 'milley', 'defense', 'secretary', 'mark', 'esper', 'us', 'withdraw', 'nato', 'despite', 'vehemently', 'opposing', 'move', 'considered', 'president’s', 'direction', '“lawful', 'order”', 'drew', 'plans', 'execute', 'withdrawal', 'bolton', 'recalls', '2018', 'summit', 'genuine', 'fear', '“honest', 'god', 'frightening', 'didn’t', 'know', 'going', 'last', 'minute', 'mean', 'going', 'nato', 'pulled', 'back', 'it”', 'bolton', 'potential', 'trump', 'targets', 'many', 'veterans', 'trump', 'administration', 'similar', 'warning', 'ukraine', '“us', 'support', 'ukraine', 'end”', 'senior', 'us', 'official', 'served', 'trump', 'biden', 'noting', 'trump', 'comment', 'town', 'hall', 'july', '2023', 'claiming', 'reelected', 'president', 'end', 'war', 'one', 'day', 'bolton', '“if', 'ukraine', 'i’d', 'worried', 'everything', 'deal', '‘what’s', 'another', 'ten', 'percent', 'ukrainian', 'territory', 'brings', 'peace’', 'kind', 'thing”', 'us', 'support', 'taiwan', 'say', 'jeopardy', 'bolton', 'recalled', 'stunt', 'trump', 'carry', 'oval', 'office', '“he', 'hold', 'tip', 'sharpie', 'pen', 'say', '‘that’s', 'taiwan', 'see', 'resolute', 'desk', 'that’s', 'china’”', 'point', 'according', 'bolton', 'taiwan', 'small', 'successfully', 'defend', 'chinese', 'invasion—', '\xad', 'small', 'us', 'care', 'bolton', 'recalled', 'mean', 'taiwan', 'worried', 'trump', 'administration”']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/rfk-jr-apologizes-cousins-super-bowl-ad/index.html,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. apologized to members of his family who objected to a new TV ad released Sunday during the Super Bowl that repurposed a spot from his uncle’s 1960 campaign. The retro-themed ad from a PAC backing his candidacy mimics the soundtrack and theme of President John F. Kennedy’s 1960 campaign ad. The spot features a dramatic orchestra opening and a jingle repeating the word “Kennedy” over and over again. The ad also feature the lyrics, “Do you want a man for president who sees it through and through? A man who’s old enough to know and young enough to do.” The words are a potential jab from the 70-year-old Kennedy toward his somewhat older competitors, 81-year-old Biden and 77-year-old former Trump, in a race defined by criticisms of age and mental cognition. “My cousin’s Super Bowl ad used our uncle’s faces- and my Mother’s. She would be appalled by his deadly health care views. Respect for science, vaccines, & health care equity were in her DNA,” Kennedy’s cousin Bobby Shriver said on X following the release of the ad. Another of Kennedy’s cousins, Mark Shriver, replied to Bobby Shiver’s post by saying “I agree with my brother @bobbyshriver simple as that.” Bobby and Mark Shriver are sons of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of President Kennedy and the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy responded to criticism from Bobby Shriver by apologizing. “Bobby. I’m so sorry if that advertisement caused you pain. The ad was created and aired by the American Values Superpac without any involvement or approvals from my campaign. Federal rules prohibit Superpacs from consulting with me or my staff. I send you and your family my sincerest apologies. God bless you,” Kennedy posted on X. American Values 2024, the group supporting Kennedy’s presidential bid, spent $7 million on the ad. More recently, the PAC faced allegations from the Democrat National Committee that it illegally contributed to Kennedy’s signature-gathering efforts. Kennedy has faced dissent from members of his family throughout his presidential run. On the day of he announced his intention to run for president as an independent, a group of his siblings called his decision to run against Biden in a general election “dangerous to our country.” Kennedy has been a leading proponent of vaccine misinformation through his Children’s Health Defense organization and has spent years wrongly suggesting that many vaccines are not safe. In a CNN interview in December, he walked back some of his comments and rejected the label that he’s “anti-vaccine” despite his history of spreading misinformation about the efficacy of vaccines. He also made a series of comments in 2022 in which he compared the Covid-19 lockdowns to Nazi Germany, arguing that “even in Hitler’s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland.” “Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment,” Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Joseph P Kennedy II and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a statement in October","['independent', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'robert', 'f', 'kennedy', 'jr', 'apologized', 'members', 'family', 'objected', 'new', 'tv', 'ad', 'released', 'sunday', 'super', 'bowl', 'repurposed', 'spot', 'uncle’s', '1960', 'campaign', 'retrothemed', 'ad', 'pac', 'backing', 'candidacy', 'mimics', 'soundtrack', 'theme', 'president', 'john', 'f', 'kennedy’s', '1960', 'campaign', 'ad', 'spot', 'features', 'dramatic', 'orchestra', 'opening', 'jingle', 'repeating', 'word', '“kennedy”', 'ad', 'feature', 'lyrics', '“do', 'want', 'man', 'president', 'sees', 'man', 'who’s', 'old', 'enough', 'know', 'young', 'enough', 'do”', 'words', 'potential', 'jab', '70yearold', 'kennedy', 'toward', 'somewhat', 'older', 'competitors', '81yearold', 'biden', '77yearold', 'trump', 'race', 'defined', 'criticisms', 'age', 'mental', 'cognition', '“my', 'cousin’s', 'super', 'bowl', 'ad', 'used', 'uncle’s', 'faces', 'mother’s', 'appalled', 'deadly', 'health', 'care', 'views', 'respect', 'science', 'vaccines', 'health', 'care', 'equity', 'dna”', 'kennedy’s', 'cousin', 'bobby', 'shriver', 'x', 'following', 'release', 'ad', 'another', 'kennedy’s', 'cousins', 'mark', 'shriver', 'replied', 'bobby', 'shiver’s', 'post', 'saying', 'agree', 'brother', 'bobbyshriver', 'simple', 'that”', 'bobby', 'mark', 'shriver', 'sons', 'eunice', 'kennedy', 'shriver', 'sister', 'president', 'kennedy', 'late', 'attorney', 'general', 'robert', 'f', 'kennedy', 'kennedy', 'responded', 'criticism', 'bobby', 'shriver', 'apologizing', '“bobby', 'i’m', 'sorry', 'advertisement', 'caused', 'pain', 'ad', 'created', 'aired', 'american', 'values', 'superpac', 'without', 'involvement', 'approvals', 'campaign', 'federal', 'rules', 'prohibit', 'superpacs', 'consulting', 'staff', 'send', 'family', 'sincerest', 'apologies', 'god', 'bless', 'you”', 'kennedy', 'posted', 'x', 'american', 'values', '2024', 'group', 'supporting', 'kennedy’s', 'presidential', 'bid', 'spent', '7', 'million', 'ad', 'recently', 'pac', 'faced', 'allegations', 'democrat', 'national', 'committee', 'illegally', 'contributed', 'kennedy’s', 'signaturegathering', 'efforts', 'kennedy', 'faced', 'dissent', 'members', 'family', 'throughout', 'presidential', 'run', 'day', 'announced', 'intention', 'run', 'president', 'independent', 'group', 'siblings', 'called', 'decision', 'run', 'biden', 'general', 'election', '“dangerous', 'country”', 'kennedy', 'leading', 'proponent', 'vaccine', 'misinformation', 'children’s', 'health', 'defense', 'organization', 'spent', 'years', 'wrongly', 'suggesting', 'many', 'vaccines', 'safe', 'interview', 'december', 'walked', 'back', 'comments', 'rejected', 'label', 'he’s', '“antivaccine”', 'despite', 'history', 'spreading', 'misinformation', 'efficacy', 'vaccines', 'made', 'series', 'comments', '2022', 'compared', 'covid19', 'lockdowns', 'nazi', 'germany', 'arguing', '“even', 'hitler’s', 'germany', 'cross', 'alps', 'switzerland”', '“bobby', 'might', 'share', 'name', 'father', 'share', 'values', 'vision', 'judgment”', 'rory', 'kennedy', 'kerry', 'kennedy', 'joseph', 'p', 'kennedy', 'ii', 'kathleen', 'kennedy', 'townsend', 'statement', 'october']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/biden-netanyahu-israel-gaza/index.html,"Biden has grown increasingly frustrated behind the scenes with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, telling advisers and others that the prime minister is ignoring his advice and obstructing efforts to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, according to people familiar with the matter. So far, Biden has stopped short of directly criticizing Netanyahu in public. But he has become increasingly critical of Israel’s tactics, saying last week he believes the campaign in Gaza is “over the top,” one of his sharpest condemnations to date of the military effort against Hamas. In private, Biden has been more willing to offer unvarnished thoughts on Netanyahu, including his deep irritation that the Israeli prime minister has not followed through on American recommendations to de-escalate military tactics in Gaza. Some officials now wonder how much longer Biden will withhold public criticism of Netanyahu as the war rages on. The president’s comments last week on Israel’s tactics reflected sentiments he has been voicing behind the scenes for a while, one person familiar with the matter said. US officials had hoped that by January, Israel would have transitioned to a lower-intensity, hyper-localized targeting campaign. The tension between the Biden administration and Netanyahu’s government has only intensified in recent days over Israel’s preparations for a ground incursion into Rafah, where thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled over the course of the war. US officials have been direct in their conversations with Israeli counterparts that the estimated 1.3 million people currently in Rafah simply “have nowhere to go,” according to a senior administration official. The Biden administration is highly skeptical about whether Netanyahu’s direction to Israel’s military for an “evacuation of the population” out of Rafah before Israel forces go in is even remotely feasible. “We have made very clear that an operation under current conditions is not something that we could envision,” the US official said. In the call, Biden told Netanyahu an operation in Rafah “should not proceed” without ensuring the safety of the more than 1 million people sheltering there, the White House said. Biden has long had his differences with Netanyahu and officials acknowledge their relationship is complex. But in recent days, a series of actions and comments have angered some American officials, who like Biden are losing patience with Netanyahu’s resistance to US advice and recommendations. That includes publicly rejecting as “crazy” a Hamas counter proposal on a deal to release hostages and pause the fighting, even as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in the region to try to advance the agreement. The majority of a 45-minute phone call between Biden and Netanyahu on Sunday was about the hostages deal, according to an official. Biden and his team have also been irritated by Netanyahu’s public rejections of a two-state solution, long a lynchpin of American policy in the region. Biden and Netanyahu, who have known each other for more than four decades, have found themselves frequently at odds, both before the October 7 Hamas attacks and after. Biden has bemoaned Netanyahu’s far-right governing coalition and told donors last year that his counterpart’s political predicament was making it difficult for the prime minister to alter his approach to Gaza. The president is also under pressure from progressive Democrat to do and say more about the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza, including through now-frequent protests at his public events. Still, White House officials have long said the president believes any differences with his counterpart are best aired behind the scenes rather than in public. Biden has made light of his disagreements with Netanyahu, recounting an inscription he wrote on an old photograph of the two men: “Bibi, I love you, but I don’t agree with a damn thing you have to say.” “It’s about the same today,” Biden said in December. Since then, however, frustrations have only mounted over Israel’s military campaign and tactics when it comes to negotiating a deal to secure the release of hostages. Biden offered his Israeli counterpart and the people of Israel his unwavering support in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 attack, even flying to the war zone to show what he said was his and the United States’ unequivocal support for their ally. Netanyahu, meanwhile, offered Biden praise over the weekend as the president was combatting questions about his age and mental acuity. In an interview, the Israeli prime minister said he found Biden “very clear, very focused” when asked about special counsel Robert Hur’s description on Biden as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” In an interview with ABC News, Netanyahu said he’s had over a dozen “extended phone conversations” with Biden. “He also came on a visit to Israel during wartime, which was a historic first, and I found him very clear and very focused,” Netanyahu said. “We managed to agree on the war aims and on many things. Sometimes disagreements, but they weren’t born of a lack of understanding on his part or on my part,” Netanyahu said.","['biden', 'grown', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'behind', 'scenes', 'israeli',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/politics/defense-secretary-lloyd-austin-hospital/index.html,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin transferred his duties to his deputy as he is hospitalized for treatment for symptoms “suggesting an emergent bladder issue,” according to the Pentagon. Austin has been admitted into the critical care unit at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and it is “not clear how long Secretary Austin will remain hospitalized,” according to a statement released Sunday night from officials at the hospital. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks assumed the functions and duties of the top spot at the Pentagon shortly before 5 p.m., Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement. The White House, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and Congress have been notified. The rapid notification of Austin’s visit to the hospital – the first statement from the Pentagon was released within three hours – came after the defense secretary acknowledged failures in notifying the administration and the public about his previous hospitalization. Lloyd was taken to Walter Reed around 2:20 p.m., Ryder said. Austin traveled to the hospital with unclassified and classified communications systems that are required for his duties. Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early December and underwent a procedure to treat the cancer on December 22. That procedure required general anesthesia and an overnight stay at Walter Reed. He then returned to the hospital on New Year’s Day after suffering from complications as a result of the procedure. Austin’s unannounced hospitalization , which was not disclosed to the media or Biden and other senior administration officials for days, raised major questions about transparency within the administration. Republican have been highly critical of how the Pentagon handled Austin’s illness, and the defense secretary is scheduled to testify to the House Armed Services Committee at the end of the month about his failure to notify key government leaders. Austin remained in the hospital for two weeks, then worked from home for another two weeks as he continued his recovery. On February 1, in his first news conference since his hospitalization, Austin acknowledged that his handling of the diagnosis and the hospitalization was a mistake. “We did not handle this right, and I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public. And I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people,” Austin said. Last week, the Office of the Secretary of Defense completed a 30-day review of the notification procedures around a transfer of responsibilities. At a news briefing Thursday, Ryder said Austin has received the review and is reviewing it. Ryder also said much of the review is classified, but the Pentagon would try to make public as much as possible. “We remain committed to being as transparent as possible about the review, and we’ll have more information once the secretary’s review is complete,” Ryder said.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/elise-stefanik-jd-vance-trump-running-mate-race/index.html,"Rep. Elise Stefanik of NewYork and Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio are both leading a legislative effort to symbolically absolve Trump from any culpability in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. They separately stumped for Trump in New Hampshire and are slated to appear at an upcoming fundraiser for the former president in DC. The Republican lawmakers each said they would not have certified the 2020 election results had they been Trump vice president, despite no evidence of fraud. And, in a sign of what might be driving their recently shared behavior: Stefanik and Vance have both said they would be happy to serve under Trump in any capacity – including as his running mate. “I’m proud to be a top surrogate,” Stefanik said during a Thursday appearance on CNN. “I would proudly serve in a future Trump administration.” Vance, meanwhile, has also expressed interest in joining Trump on the ticket. “If he asked me, I would certainly consider it,” he recently told CNN. “But I like being a senator.” The veepstakes auditions are heating up on Capitol Hill as Trump steamrolls his way to the nomination, with Stefanik and Vance, who are both 39, largely at the center of the jockeying. And as Republican lawmakers maneuver to make themselves a more attractive candidate, they are reviving false claims about the 2020 election to rewrite the narrative about January 6 and clear Trump name as he faces potential political and legal fallout for his role on that day. Rep. Tim Burchett, a Trump-friendly Republican lawmaker from Tennessee, acknowledged that some of his colleagues seem eager to prove their loyalty to Trump in hopes of joining him on the ticket, but said the competition has been nothing but friendly. “I don’t see anybody elbowing anybody as a way to get Trump,” he said. “I think it’s kind of a big tent situation.” But another GOP lawmaker had a slightly less charitable view of the situation. “They just can’t kiss his butt enough,” the GOP lawmaker told CNN, when asked about the apparent jockeying among members to become vice president. “It’s obvious.” For his part, Trump is not ready to have serious conversations about choosing a running mate, GOP sources familiar with the matter say. But that hasn’t stopped him from fundraising off the idea of a veepstakes and tossing out various names in private conversations, fueling rampant chatter inside the GOP about which of their colleagues might be on his short-list. “He likes to have fun and say, ‘Gee, you know, this senator is good, and you know, Elise would be good.’ But he has not made any decision,” GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told CNN of his conversations with Trump. “I think he’s enjoying the fact that there’s a lot of discussion about it.” January 6 becomes focus among vice presidential wannabes While there is a whole host of Republican from across the country who are seen as vice presidential hopefuls, GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been using their powerful platforms in Congress to try to stand out from the rest of the pack. A prime example played out in the Capitol last week, as GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida introduced a largely symbolic resolution declaring Trump did not incite an insurrection or rebellion, which comes amid court challenges over whether Trump can remain on the ballot . Trump was impeached by the House, including by 10 House Republican , for inciting an insurrection. When Gaetz started informing colleagues he was drafting the measure, Stefanik and Vance – two of Trump biggest cheerleaders on Capitol Hill – both raced behind the scenes to become faces of the effort, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Vance, who earned a Trump endorsement during his Senate race, ultimately introduced a Senate companion measure. And Stefanik, who is the No. 4 House Republican as GOP conference chair, became a chief co-sponsor with Gaetz and then personally lobbied members to sign on to the resolution, GOP sources said, in a bid to maximize Republican support. Nearly one-third of the House GOP Conference is now supporting the measure. That includes Reps. Byron Donalds of Florida and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who are also said to be interested in joining Trump on the ticket and have acted as surrogates for Trump on the campaign trail, though they are seen as long shots. Stefanik and Vance’s high-profile involvement did not go unnoticed by their colleagues. Multiple Republican thought the pair’s maneuvering – which for Stefanik included leading a news conference alongside dozens of her colleagues in the Capitol last week – was squarely aimed at an audience of one. And indeed, the effort did not go unnoticed by Trump himself. “He was thrilled that so many members had signed on,” said Gaetz, when asked by CNN whether he talked to Trump about the resolution. “Trump was heartened by his many supporters who are backing our legislative endeavor.” Stefanik has been one of the most aggressive Republican who appears to be campaigning to be vice president, taking steps designed to directly appeal to some of Trump biggest preoccupations: congressional endorsements and looming legal cases. She was the first Republican member of Congress to endorse Trump, before he even officially announced; has filed multiple judicial complaints against the prosecutors overseeing Trump legal cases; embraced Trump reference to January 6 defendants who are in jail as “hostages”; and erased all her old press releases from before this session of Congress, including statements condemning the violence on January 6. In her Thursday interview on CNN’s “The Source” with Kaitlan Collins, Stefanik denied she was trying to hide past her critical statements, saying they are still available on other social media channels. Video Ad Feedback Collins asks Stefanik if she would have certified the election like Pence 01:15 - Source: CNN “I only have the press releases from this current Congress. All of those statements are available since I was elected on multiple social media accounts. And you can access it there,” she said. But her most controversial moment of the interview came when Stefanik said she would not have certified the 2020 election results, which were legitimate but continue to be mischaracterized by Trump and his allies, who villainized former Vice President Mike Pence for his actions that day. “I would not have done what Mike Pence did. I don’t think that was the right approach,” Stefanik said. “I specifically stand by what I said on the House floor. And, I stand by my statement, which was there was unconstitutional overreach.” Notably, her remarks came just days after Vance said on ABC’s “This Week” that he would not have certified the election results until states submitted pro-Trump electors – a sign the issue is increasingly becoming a new litmus test in the veepstakes. “If I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the US Congress should have fought over it from there,” Vance said. “That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that’s what we should have done.” Vance, though, isn’t the only senator who might be vying for the VP role. Sen. Tim Scott of SouthCarolina, who dropped out of the GOP presidential primary last year, endorsed Trump ahead of the New Hampshire primary and then immediately joined him on the campaign trail. Scott’s endorsement is likely to carry extra significance for Trump, since it gave the former president a prime opportunity to tweak his rival Nikki Haley, who also hails from SouthCarolina. But even as vice presidential wannabes try to maneuver in Washington, there is no shortage of attempts to curry favor with Trump on his home turf as well: One GOP lawmaker described the people trying to get face time with the former president at his hotel in Mar-a-Lago as a “constant drumbeat.”","['rep', 'elise', 'stefanik', 'newyork', 'sen', 'jd', 'vance', 'ohio', 'leading', 'legislative',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/10/politics/trump-russia-nato/index.html,"Trump on Saturday said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense in a stunning admission he would not abide by the collective-defense clause at the heart of the alliance if reelected. “NATO was busted until I came along,” Trump said at a rally in Conway, SouthCarolina. “I said, ‘Everybody’s gonna pay.’ They said, ‘Well, if we don’t pay, are you still going to protect us?’ I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ They couldn’t believe the answer.” Trump said “one of the presidents of a big country” at one point asked him whether the US would still defend the country if they were invaded by Russia even if they “don’t pay.” “No, I would not protect you,” Trump recalled telling that president. “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.” Biden said Sunday that Trump “is making it clear that he will abandon our NATO allies” and outlined the potential consequences of Trump comments. “Trump admission that he intends to give Putin a greenlight for more war and violence, to continue his brutal assault against a free Ukraine, and to expand his aggression to the people of Poland and the Baltic States are appalling and dangerous,” Biden said in a statement via his campaign. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, meanwhile, said Sunday that Trump comments about the alliance put European and American soldiers at risk. “Any attack on NATO will be met with a united and forceful response,” Stoltenberg said in a statement. “Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the US, and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk.” European Council President Charles Michel on Sunday described comments from Trump on NATO “reckless,” adding they “serve only Putin’s interest.” Trump greets supporters at his Nevada caucus night watch party in Las Vegas on February 8, 2024. Mario Tama/Getty Images Related article Trump attacks Haley for absence of her husband, who is deployed At the core of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty is the promise of collective defense — that an attack on one member nation is an attack on all the nations in the alliance. Trump has long complained about the amount other countries in NATO spend on defense compared with the United States and has repeatedly threatened to withdraw the US from NATO. But his comments Saturday are his most direct indication he does not intend to defend NATO allies from Russian attack if he is reelected. Trump has for years inaccurately described how NATO funding works. NATO has a target that each member country spends a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, and most countries are not meeting that target. But the figure is a guideline and not a binding contract, nor does it create “bills”; member countries haven’t been failing to pay their share of NATO’s common budget to run the organization. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who has endorsed Trump, said Sunday he had “zero concerns” about the former president’s NATO comments. Rubio told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that Trump was merely reflecting on an anecdote from his presidency, arguing member nations weren’t “paying their dues” until Trump “used leverage” to push NATO countries to “step up to the plate.” “Trump just the first one to express it in these terms,” the Florida Republican said. As president, Trump privately threatened multiple times to withdraw the United States from NATO, according to The NewYork Times . Trump has described NATO as “obsolete” and has aligned himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who wants to weaken the alliance. Trump has long praised Putin and went as far as to side with the Russian leader over the US intelligence community over Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/politics/senate-weekend-work-foreign-aid-package/index.html,"The Senate on Sunday took a step closer to passing a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with crucial assistance for Ukraine and Israel following a key vote to move the package forward – including with the support of 18 Republican despite opposition from former Trump. The foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine. The vote was 67 to 27. One more GOP senator voted “yes” on Sunday’s procedural vote than Thursday’s procedural vote on the bill — a sign that GOP support for the measure has remained consistent and even expanded in recent days, despite Trump lobbying effort against US foreign aid and a previous package that included border policy changes and funding. If the bill is eventually passed by the Senate, it would next go to the House, where it’s unclear when or whether Speaker Mike Johnson would hold a vote on it. Many House Republican are opposed to further aid to Ukraine, and Trump has campaigned against passage of legislation that could be seen as a win for Biden. The Senate is working through the weekend on the bill, but it may still be days until a final vote as GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky continues to slow the process . The chamber cleared a critical 60-vote threshold to advance the bill Thursday, took another procedural vote Friday night and held a floor debate on the legislation Saturday. But without an agreement from all 100 senators to speed up the process and swiftly pass the legislation, the Senate met Sunday afternoon with a final vote sometime in the week. “I can’t remember the last time the Senate was in session on Super Bowl Sunday,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. “But as I’ve said all week long, we’re going to keep working on this bill until the job is done.” Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” he believes the Senate will be able to pass the bill that includes funding for Ukraine by early to midweek.

REUTERS/Nathan Howard Nathan Howard/Reuters Related article McConnell’s GOP critics grow louder as party descends into feud over Ukraine and immigration Lawmakers are moving forward with the foreign aid bill after Republican blocked a broader bill that would have combined foreign aid with a bipartisan border deal. Republican had initially demanded that border security be part of the bill, but went on to reject the bipartisan deal amid forceful attacks on the measure by Trump and top House Republican. For his part, the former president also wrote Saturday on Truth Social that the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is structured as a loan, illustrating the political pressure on Republican to kill the legislation. “ARE YOU LISTENING U.S. SENATE” Trump wrote. Paul continued to dig in on Sunday, repeating similar comments that he will hold out until “hell freezes over.” He indicated he is ready to hold the floor by speaking on the issue of national debt and other matters. “I love to talk,” Paul said. “That’s one of my favorite things to do. Yes, and I slept all day yesterday waiting for this. I’m going to take Adderall — nah, I’m just kidding.” “We do this for a purpose,” he added. “I don’t like being here … I’m not here because it’s fun, I’m here because I don’t think enough people are talking about the danger of the debt.” Senate Republican are now divided over the foreign aid package, and some are pushing for amendments to make changes to the bill – including to add measures related to immigration and border policy. Schumer has said that Democrat hope to reach an agreement with Republican over amendments, though it is not clear whether a deal will be reached. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer walks to meet reporters at the Capitol in Washington, DC on Wednesday. J. Scott Applewhite/AP The bill includes $60 billion to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia, $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel, $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance and $4.8 billion to support regional partners in the Indo-Pacific region, among other provisions, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee. As the Senate continues its debate on the legislation over the weekend, advocates are calling on lawmakers to approve an amendment that would give Afghans who were evacuated during the US’ withdrawal of Afghanistan a path to permanent legal residency in the US. The amendment, introduced by Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas on Friday, would “allow Afghan allies to apply for permanent legal residency to provide certainty as they build their lives in the United States after undergoing thorough vetting,” according to a news release from Klobuchar. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas is holding up that amendment over changes he wants to make. It’s also unlikely senators will be able to reach a bipartisan agreement for vote on any amendments","['senate',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/politics/biden-netanyahu-phone-call-israel-gaza-hostages/index.html,"Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed a deal to secure the release of hostages in Gaza at length on Sunday, according to a senior administration official, who cautioned that while a framework is in place, gaps remain. In their first call since January 19, Biden and Netanyahu discussed Israel’s ongoing campaign in Gaza, the return of hostages held by Hamas, and Israel’s anticipated ground assault on the city of Rafah, which has drawn concern from the US and from others in the region. “The President reaffirmed our shared goal to see Hamas defeated and to ensure the long-term security of Israel and its people. The President and the Prime Minister discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas,” a statement from the White House said. Over the last several months, the US has attempted to put more pressure on the Israeli government to support a “humanitarian pause” in its war against Hamas. But those efforts have yielded little success. Last week, Netanyahu called Hamas’ recent proposals for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza “delusional.” The full Hamas response proposes three phases, each lasting 45 days, including the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, a massive humanitarian effort, and freedom of movement for people throughout Gaza, according to a copy obtained by CNN. “There is not a commitment – there has to be a negotiation, it’s a process, and at the moment, from what I see from Hamas, it’s not happening,” Netanyahu said. There are 136 hostages being held in Gaza, including 132 who were captured during Hamas’ October 7 attack. Twenty-nine of the hostages are dead, according to the Israeli prime minister’s office. Secretary of State Antony Blinken previously said negotiations toward an agreement would continue despite the Israeli prime minister’s comments, which Blinken said were referencing the “absolute non-starters” in the proposal. The call between Biden and Netanyahu lasted about 45 minutes, and two-thirds of the call was focused on the release of hostages, according to the senior Biden administration official. “There are certainly gaps that need to be closed. Some of them are significant, but there has been real progress over the last few weeks, and we are now seeking to do all we possibly can to capitalize on it,” the official said. Biden on Sunday “reaffirmed his view that a military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people sheltering there,” the White House said. Netanyahu last week said the Israel Defense Forces would “soon go into Rafah, Hamas’ last bastion.” More than 1.3 million people are believed to be in the southern city, the majority of whom were displaced from other parts of Gaza, according to the United Nations. Netanyahu called for the people in Rafah to evacuate ahead of the ground assault, but it is unclear where they could go; the city borders Egypt to the south, but the border has been closed for months. The US has said it would not support an Israeli military operation in Rafah “without serious planning” given the risks. “We have made very clear that an operation under current conditions is not something that we could envision,” the senior administration official said. Biden phone call with Netanyahu comes a few days after the president offered one of his sharpest rebukes to date of Israel’s military conduct in Gaza, saying the operation to go after Hamas had been “over the top.” “I’m of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in Gaza – in the Gaza Strip – has been over the top,” Biden told reporters at the White House on Thursday, describing his own efforts to open up Gaza so more humanitarian aid could flow in. Biden and Netanyahu didn’t specifically address the president’s comment, the senior administration official said. Last week, Blinken told Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials that the civilian toll in Gaza “remains too high” as violence continues in the region. “Nearly 2 million people have been displaced from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are experiencing acute hunger. Most have lost someone that they love. And day after day, more people are killed,” Blinken said at a news conference after meeting with top Israeli officials. The Israeli offensive, launched after the Hamas attack just over four months ago, has taken an immense humanitarian toll on the strip, with tens of thousands dead and the population of Gaza on the brink of famine. Officials see a cessation in fighting as central to both their short- and longer-term objectives for Gaza as international and domestic US pressure to end the conflict mounts. Earlier Sunday, Biden also spoke with Blinken, CIA Director Bill Burns, Vice President Kamala Harris, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his senior White House team","['biden', 'israeli', 'prime', 'minister', 'benjamin', 'netanyahu', 'discussed', 'deal', 'secure', 'release', 'hostages', 'gaza', 'length', 'sunday', 'according', 'senior', 'administration', 'official', 'cautioned', 'framework', 'place', 'gaps', 'remain', 'first', 'call', 'since', 'january', '19', 'biden', 'netanyahu', 'discussed', 'israel’s', 'ongoing', 'campaign', 'gaza', 'return', 'hostages', 'held', 'hamas', 'israel’s', 'anticipated', 'ground', 'assault', 'city', 'rafah', 'drawn', 'concern', 'us', 'others', 'region', '“the', 'president', 'reaffirmed', 'shared', 'goal', 'see', 'hamas', 'defeated', 'ensure', 'longterm', 'security', 'israel', 'people', 'president', 'prime', 'minister', 'discussed', 'ongoing', 'efforts', 'secure', 'release', 'remaining', 'hostages', 'held', 'hamas”', 'statement', 'white', 'house', 'last', 'several', 'months', 'us', 'attempted', 'put', 'pressure', 'israeli', 'government', 'support', '“humanitarian', 'pause”', 'war', 'hamas', 'efforts', 'yielded', 'little', 'success', 'last', 'week', 'netanyahu', 'called', 'hamas’', 'recent', 'proposals', 'ceasefire', 'hostage', 'deal', 'gaza', '“delusional”', 'full', 'hamas', 'response', 'proposes', 'three', 'phases', 'lasting', '45', 'days', 'including', 'withdrawal', 'israeli', 'troops', 'gaza', 'massive', 'humanitarian', 'effort', 'freedom', 'movement', 'people', 'throughout', 'gaza', 'according', 'copy', 'obtained', '“there', 'commitment', 'negotiation', 'process', 'moment', 'see', 'hamas', 'happening”', 'netanyahu', '136', 'hostages', 'held', 'gaza', 'including', '132', 'captured', 'hamas’', 'october', '7', 'attack', 'twentynine', 'hostages', 'dead', 'according', 'israeli', 'prime', 'minister’s', 'office', 'secretary', 'state', 'antony', 'blinken', 'previously', 'negotiations', 'toward', 'agreement', 'continue', 'despite', 'israeli', 'prime', 'minister’s', 'comments', 'blinken', 'referencing', '“absolute', 'nonstarters”', 'proposal', 'call', 'biden', 'netanyahu', 'lasted', '45', 'minutes', 'twothirds', 'call', 'focused', 'release', 'hostages', 'according', 'senior', 'biden', 'administration', 'official', '“there', 'certainly', 'gaps', 'need', 'closed', 'significant', 'real', 'progress', 'last', 'weeks', 'seeking', 'possibly', 'capitalize', 'it”', 'official', 'biden', 'sunday', '“reaffirmed', 'view', 'military', 'operation', 'rafah', 'proceed', 'without', 'credible', 'executable', 'plan', 'ensuring', 'safety', 'support', 'one', 'million', 'people', 'sheltering', 'there”', 'white', 'house', 'netanyahu', 'last', 'week', 'israel', 'defense', 'forces', '“soon', 'go', 'rafah', 'hamas’', 'last', 'bastion”', '13', 'million', 'people', 'believed', 'southern', 'city', 'majority', 'displaced', 'parts', 'gaza', 'according', 'united', 'nations', 'netanyahu', 'called', 'people', 'rafah', 'evacuate', 'ahead', 'ground', 'assault', 'unclear', 'go', 'city', 'borders', 'egypt', 'south', 'border', 'closed', 'months', 'us', 'support', 'israeli', 'military', 'operation', 'rafah', '“without', 'serious', 'planning”', 'given', 'risks', '“we', 'made', 'clear', 'operation', 'current', 'conditions', 'something', 'envision”', 'senior', 'administration', 'official', 'biden', 'phone', 'call', 'netanyahu', 'comes', 'days', 'president', 'offered', 'one', 'sharpest', 'rebukes', 'date', 'israel’s', 'military', 'conduct', 'gaza', 'saying', 'operation', 'go', 'hamas', '“over', 'top”', '“i’m', 'view', 'know', 'conduct', 'response', 'gaza', 'gaza', 'strip', 'top”', 'biden', 'reporters', 'white', 'house', 'thursday', 'describing', 'efforts', 'open', 'gaza', 'humanitarian', 'aid', 'flow', 'biden', 'netanyahu', 'didn’t', 'specifically', 'address', 'president’s', 'comment', 'senior', 'administration', 'official', 'last', 'week', 'blinken', 'netanyahu', 'top', 'israeli', 'officials', 'civilian', 'toll', 'gaza', '“remains', 'high”', 'violence', 'continues', 'region', '“nearly', '2', 'million', 'people', 'displaced', 'homes', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'experiencing', 'acute', 'hunger', 'lost', 'someone', 'love', 'day', 'day', 'people', 'killed”', 'blinken', 'conference', 'meeting', 'top', 'israeli', 'officials', 'israeli', 'offensive', 'launched', 'hamas', 'attack', 'four', 'months', 'ago', 'taken', 'immense', 'humanitarian', 'toll', 'strip', 'tens', 'thousands', 'dead', 'population', 'gaza', 'brink', 'famine', 'officials', 'see', 'cessation', 'fighting', 'central', 'short', 'longerterm', 'objectives', 'gaza', 'international', 'domestic', 'us', 'pressure', 'end', 'conflict', 'mounts', 'earlier', 'sunday', 'biden', 'spoke', 'blinken', 'cia', 'director', 'bill', 'burns', 'vice', 'president', 'kamala', 'harris', 'national', 'security', 'adviser', 'jake', 'sullivan', 'senior', 'white', 'house', 'team']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/politics/rubio-trump-nato-haley-husband-national-guard-cnntv/index.html,"GOP Sen. Marco Rubio defended former Trump’s controversial comment that he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to a NATO member country that didn’t meet defense spending guidelines. “That’s not what happened, and that’s not how I view that statement,” the Florida Republican argued Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union when asked whether he was comfortable with Trump suggestion that he wouldn’t defend NATO countries. Rubio went on to note that the US did not leave NATO during Trump presidency — though Trump made private threats about withdrawing multiple times, according to The NewYork Times . “Trump is not a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,” Rubio told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “He doesn’t talk like a traditional politician, and we’ve already been through this. You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.” At Saturday’s rally in Conway, North Carolina, Trump said “one of the presidents of a big country” at one point asked him whether the US would still defend the country if they were invaded by Russia even if they “don’t pay.” “No, I would not protect you,” Trump recalled telling that president. “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.” Trump has for years inaccurately described how NATO funding works. NATO has a target that each member country spends a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, and most countries are not meeting that target. But the figure is a guideline and not a binding contract, and it does not create “bills”; member countries haven’t been failing to pay their share of NATO’s common budget to run the organization. Rubio, who recently pushed through legislation that would require an act of Congress before a US commander in chief could withdraw the country from NATO, contended Trump was merely reflecting on an anecdote from his presidency. He added that “virtually every American president” has aired grievances about other nations not doing enough for the alliance. “Trump just the first one to express it in these terms,” said Rubio, who is vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. A stark departure Rubio also responded to Trump derisive comments about the absence of GOP contender Nikki Haley’s husband, Michael, who is deployed overseas. Rubio characterized the remarks as a product of the “increasing nastiness of this campaign and every campaign in American politics.” “I mean, they’re calling him a grumpy old man.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/politics/mitch-mcconnell-leadership-gop-dispute/index.html,"Mitch McConnell had long prided himself on maintaining GOP unity during his 17-year tenure as Senate GOP leader. That’s hardly the case anymore. As his party has descended into a bitter dispute over immigration , his small contingent of foes within his conference has grown louder and much more outspoken, driven in large part over the border, Ukraine and – in no small part – Trump. In the past, GOP grumblings about McConnell were mostly done in private. Now they’ve spilled into public view as the Kentucky Republican heads into what could be his final year as leader. At least five of his detractors have openly called for new leadership in recent days – even holding a news conference last week demanding his ouster, a move that would have been unthinkable in years past but underscores how the 118th Congress has been unquestionably McConnell’s most tumultuous period atop his conference. “There’s a lot of division even over Mitch remaining leader,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican who supports McConnell, noting his foes who have gone public are the same ones who were critical of him in the past. “Mitch could argue that he’s got a followership problem as much as they have a leader problem.” Asked if McConnell should run again for leader, Cramer said: “He’s the world’s greatest vote counter, and I don’t know what he might want to do. What I can’t imagine is why he would want to run again.“ During his reign in the Senate, McConnell has been lauded by his Republican allies and Democrat foes alike as a tactician calculating ways to stay ahead of his opponents and always with an eye on the next election. On Friday, his backers were quick to point out more of those attributes as he helped woo former Gov. Larry Hogan into the US Senate race in Maryland , suddenly turning a safe Democrat seat into a competitive one, a major boost for the GOP. “That was a huge victory for the good guys,” McConnell, whose big-spending super PAC is once again poised to be a major player in key Senate races, said Friday. “To have a genuinely competitive candidate in a blue state like that is a big development.” But what has caused the most tension in the ranks: McConnell’s long campaign to unequivocally support Ukraine with billions more in US dollars, an issue that has now left the 81-year-old in the minority of his conference at a time when Trump, once again, is driving the direction of his party and has openly called on the GOP to dump him as leader.

Alex Brandon/AP “McConnell’s problem is that he doesn’t actually talk to or listen to voter or his members. … I don’t think I’ve had a conversation with McConnell in over a year,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who voted against McConnell as leader and has emerged as one of his leading critics in the conference. “The guy, he’s completely bubble-wrapped.” The debate over McConnell’s leadership has also been a point of contention in closed-door GOP conference meetings over the last month as members have pointedly questioned him and sparred with colleagues over the best strategy on immigration – sessions described by senators as “robust,” “vigorous” and “ugly.” McConnell’s critics see an opening to seize on his leadership as they view his position on Ukraine as incongruent with the majority of Republican voter back home. “I think it was a huge mistake for him to be championing sending money to Ukraine at the expense of trying to figure out our border problem first,” said Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a fellow Kentuckian who used to be closely aligned with the GOP leader but who has been sharply at odds with him in recent years. Yet what’s angered McConnell’s allies and inner circle is this: McConnell selected GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma to cut a deal to impose new restrictions on the US border because Republican themselves had demanded action on the border before green-lighting more aid to Ukraine. Sen. James Lankford does a TV news interview on Capitol Hill at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Monday, February 5. J. Scott Applewhite/AP Related article Republican line up to sink Senate border bill negotiated by one of their own Lankford, with the help of McConnell, then cut a bipartisan deal after nearly five months of negotiations and forced the White House to make key concessions. But Republican – at the urging of Trump – rushed to kill it , even before fully reviewing the details. Ultimately, McConnell chose to vote against proceeding to the very deal he cut, with just four Republican supporting moving forward with it. “I followed the instructions of our conference who were insisting that we tackle this in October,” McConnell said last week when asked about his handling of the episode. Others said there was no way around Trump opposition, which ultimately led House GOP leaders to come out against the border deal that they argued was too weak. And once top House Republican vowed to kill it, GOP senators said there was no point in moving ahead. “Trump wanted the border bill to be killed, and I think the base of our party is happy with that,” said Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, one of the four Republican who voted to advance the border package. “We did what Trump wanted.” With McConnell’s backing, the Senate is now taking a different approach. McConnell and 16 other Senate Republican voted to advance a $95.3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan – without any new border policy measures – and the measure is expected to pass the chamber by the middle of this week. Two of McConnell’s potential successors, Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and John Thune of South Dakota, voted to advance the aid package – while a third, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, voted to block it. “This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy and demonstrating to our allies and adversaries alike that we’re serious about exercising American strength,” McConnell said, defending his position. Yet McConnell’s critics are now blaming him. “Horrible,” Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who has called on McConnell to step aside, said of his handling of the talks. “He’s mishandled this.” Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who unsuccessfully challenged McConnell for leader after the 2022 midterms, said of Lankford: “He’s been sent on a suicide mission.” “ engineered a process that was destined to fail. The only outcome it was likely to produce was a bill that failed to secure the border and simultaneously provided political camouflage for Democrat,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, who called for McConnell to step down last week. “McConnell just effectively gave the largest in-kind contribution to the Democrat Senate Committee in history.” Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, leaves a Republican Senate conference meeting at the US Capitol ahead of vote on February 7, 2024 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Asked about Cruz, who has long sparred with the GOP leader, McConnell quipped: “I think we can all agree that Sen. Cruz is not a fan.” On the floor Thursday, Cruz approached McConnell and engaged with the leader after the Texas Republican had assailed him earlier in the week. McConnell, cracking a reserved smile on his face and holding his hands together in front of him, nodded periodically. A source familiar with the interaction said: “Cruz was actually trying to make up with the leader” in that conversation. A Cruz spokesperson declined to comment on the conversation, as did McConnell’s. “Sen Cruz talks every day with his colleagues, and his conversations with fellow senators are confidential,” the Cruz spokesperson said. McConnell’s possible successors split on Ukraine aid McConnell has not divulged whether he will try to stay as leader after the 2024 elections, committing so far only to remain in the spot through the end of this Congress . Yet many Senate Republican told CNN that McConnell would likely have the support to remain as leader if he chose to hang on. “Mitch is a guy, year in, year out, who has been able to kind of bring us all together,” said Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota. Rounds said of the battle over immigration and Ukraine: “This is one of those more challenging ones, that’s all, and this is a really important issue that a lot of us feel very strongly about.” Asked if he could sustain support if he ran again for leader, Rounds argued, “There’s no question in my mind that as of right now, today, Mitch is the leader, and he would have more than a majority of support of the conference.” McConnell’s allies said the GOP leader knew full well he would endure backlash over his handling of Ukraine – given where the Trump wing of the party stands on that issue.

But not everyone is as confident McConnell will stay on – especially if Trump becomes president – given that the two haven’t spoken in more than three years and McConnell has stood by his withering criticism of Trump over the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama and close Trump ally, said that “everybody” has concerns about McConnell’s handling of the talks. “The direction we took this – we gotta have leadership.” “There will be a lot of talk about it when we come back,” said Tuberville, who backed McConnell in the past","['mitch', 'mcconnell', 'long', 'prided', 'maintaining', 'gop', 'unity', '17year',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/biden-border-bill/index.html,"The failure of a bipartisan border deal reached by senators this weekend appears set to hand Biden an issue that he can wield against former Trump and GOP lawmakers on the campaign trail. Biden on Tuesday promised to blame Republican in Congress directly for the apparent failure of the deal , saying the country will hear about how those Republican caved to Trump attempts to scuttle the bill after months of intense bipartisan negotiations. Senate Republican tanked the bill in a key vote Wednesday, 49-50. The bill would have included some of the most significant changes in immigration policy seen in decades, along with aid for Ukraine and Israel. But any hope for the deal seemed to be dashed after Trump came out against it, apparently so he could campaign on Biden perceived weakness on the border. Speaking from the White House on Tuesday, Biden vowed to turn Trump strategy around on him. “If the bill fails,” Biden said, “I want to be absolutely clear about something: the American people are going to know why.” CNN video Related video Tapper presses Rubio’s decision to not support bipartisan border security deal The failure of the bill could give Biden a political upper hand, allowing him the opportunity to say that a deal on the border had been brokered until Trump torpedoed it, effectively punting what has been his most challenging domestic issue to his likely 2024 rival. “Every day between now and November the American people are going to know the only reason the border is not secure is Trump and his MAGA Republican friends. It’s time for Republican in Congress to show a little courage, to show a little spine, to make clear to the American people that you work for them, not for anyone else.” But the failure of the bill still leaves unresolved an intractable political issue which has vexed presidents and Congresses of both parties for decades - one that has led to what leaders near the border have called a true humanitarian crisis . It would also have a real impact on battlefields from Ukraine to Gaza, Biden warned. In response to the failed package, Senate leaders are planning to move forward with a procedural vote that includes emergency aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan but doesn’t include the border provisions that Republican demanded before turning them down. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer plans to force a vote on the emergency aid on Wednesday, according to a Democrat aide. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Republican have endorsed the move – so it’s possible Schumer could get 60 vote to take up the aid package. But Speaker Mike Johnson has opposed tying these all together, so taking this step would set up a showdown with the House. A standalone bill that would provide $17.6 billion in aid to Israel previously failed in the House Tuesday night. Biden said that those who oppose the border bill are “denying aid” to Palestinian people who are “really suffering.” “This bipartisan agreement also provides Israel with what it needs to protect its people and defend himself against Hamas terrorists, and it will provide the necessary lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people,” the president said. “By opposing this bill, they are denying aid to the people who are really suffering and desperately need help.” The bill’s failure could also exasperate the burgeoning standoff between Biden administration and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office. The latter has taken extraordinary steps to address what he has described as a void in federal law enforcement on the border by giving local law enforcement the ability to arrest migrants, and placing razor wire on the border to deter unlawful crossings. Abbott has defied a SupremeCourt order to remove the wire. The bill included provisions that would require the Department of Homeland Security to bar migrants, except unaccompanied minors, from crossing the border between ports of entry if unlawful crossings reached a certain threshold. It also enhanced the legal standard of proof required for the processing of asylum claims and expanded use of Alternatives to Detention, like ankle monitors, for migrants to check in with authorities. Those provisions, Biden said, amounted to “the most fair, humane reforms in our immigration systems in a long time - and the toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever.” Congressional Republican had been largely pleased with the resulting deal. The reliably conservative Border Patrol union endorsed it, and Biden and Republican negotiators repeatedly signaled their joint optimism that a deal would be reached. But it all unraveled after Trump, who remains a GOP kingmaker, signaled his opposition. “Now, all indications are this bill won’t even move forward to the Senate floor,” Biden said. “Why? A simple reason: Trump.” Trump, Biden said, would “rather weaponize this issue than actually solve it.” Biden campaign immediately seized on Trump push to sink the border bill, sending supporters an email listing the instances when Trump called for immigration reform. “Trump has directed MAGA Republican to kill the toughest and fairest reforms to secure the border in decades because he thinks it will help him politically,” the Biden campaign said in an email blast. The president also referenced in a post on X a recent campaign rally in which Trump said he’d take the blame from senators for the bill’s collapse. “You got it,” Biden wrote.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/politics/nikki-haley-immigration-policy/index.html,"A few months into her first term as governor, Nikki Haley signed one of the strictest immigration bills in the country. Like Arizona’s infamous “show me your papers” law, the most controversial part of SouthCarolina’s legislation required law enforcement to check people’s legal status during stops if they suspected they were in the country illegally. Critics said it would lead to racial profiling. Haley drew on her own background as the daughter of immigrants who came to the country legally to stress that the bill wasn’t about intolerance, but upholding the law. “This enforces the fact that illegal immigration is not welcome in SouthCarolina,” Haley said at a press conference after signing the bill. “Legal immigration is more than welcome.” More than a decade later, Haley’s record on immigration is under fire as former Trump seeks to make border policy a key part of his campaign to secure the GOP presidential nomination and defeat Biden in the general election. As Trump and his allies attempt to paint Haley as weak on border security, the former SouthCarolina governor is pushing back by leaning into both her immigration record in the state and her vision for future federal policy. This month, Haley criticized Trump for killing a bipartisan border agreement and delaying reforms until after the election. She has pointed to the time she’s spent on the US border with Mexico and laid out a border plan that would add more border patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, defund sanctuary cities and increase deportations. And she has stressed that when she was governor, her state pushed back on a former Democrat president. “We passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country,” Haley said last week at a rally in Aiken, SouthCarolina. “President Obama sued us over it, and we won.” Parts of the 2011 law – one provision made it a crime to transport an undocumented person and another made it a crime to fail to carry an alien registration card –  were blocked by the courts. Strict guardrails were also placed on when a law enforcement officer could question someone about their legal status and prevented officers from detaining people to investigate. But key parts remained intact. It tightened rules around employers using the federal E-Verify database to check if employees are able to work in the country legally and created an Immigration Enforcement Unit to target undocumented immigrants suspected of crimes. “We need to take what we did in SouthCarolina and we need to go national with it,” Haley said in a digital ad released Monday. Attacks on immigration The efforts come in the wake of attacks from Trump and his allies eager to give the former president a decisive win in the Palmetto State’s February 24 primary. The Trump campaign and a super PAC backing the president both released ads ahead of the New Hampshire primary hitting Haley on border policy. And earlier this month, Trump allies held a news conference outside the state capitol on Haley’s “weakness on immigration.” “Trump knows what the American people want. He’s driving the Trump Train of sensible immigration policy,” SouthCarolina state Treasurer Curtis Loftis said at the news conference. “Nikki Haley and others have recently jumped on that train, but they’re just passengers.” Loftis, one of dozens of SouthCarolina elected officials who have backed Trump over Haley, said the former governor and her allies “benefit from open borders because they love, they thrive, they just enjoy cheap labor at every level of their lives.” An ad from the Trump campaign said Haley opposed the former president’s border wall and his campaign pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country. Haley has said that she supports a border wall, but thinks a wall alone isn’t enough to stop illegal immigration. When Trump called for a Muslim ban as a candidate, Haley said the proposal was “absolutely un-American .” “The same year Nikki Haley passed one of the toughest immigration laws in the country as governor, Trump was still a NewYork City liberal donating to Kamala Harris,” Haley spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement. “Nikki knows that we are a country of laws, and the minute that we lose that, we give up everything this country was founded on. South Carolinians know she’ll be tough on illegal immigration as president because she did it already as governor.” As Haley continues her longshot challenge to Trump, she has struggled to emphasize her Tea Party roots to voter, many of whom see her as a more traditional Republican. While that has helped her with moderates and independents, it has hurt her with conservatives and the bulk of GOP primary voter, who favor Trump overwhelmingly. A Monmouth University/Washington Post poll released February 1 found that 62% of potential SouthCarolina Republican primary voter trust Trump most on immigration, 22% said they trust Haley more and 15% said they trust them equally. Overall, Trump led by 26 points, with 58% of voter backing the former president and 32% supporting Haley. Fighting the Obama administration Haley’s approach to immigration policy over the last 13 years has closely mirrored changes in the way the Republican Party has juggled the issue. During Obama’s first term in office, SouthCarolina joined a handful of states that sought to take immigration enforcement into their own hands. “What we saw happening was a number of states sort of looking to jump on what they saw as a bandwagon of anti-immigrant legislation that I think a lot of people saw as an easy political win,” said Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, one of the groups that challenged the law. The 2011 immigration law Haley signed was part of a small wave of legislation with “show me your papers” style provisions, which required law enforcement to ask for people’s immigration documents during traffic or other stops if they suspected them of being in the country illegally. The law, known as Act 69, was soon challenged by the Obama Justice Department and immigrant rights groups. They successfully argued that parts of the laws were preempted by federal law. “It’s not the job of state law enforcement to enforce immigration law,” said Michelle Lapointe, the deputy director for legal at the National Immigration Law Center.  “And that’s been made clear, over and over again, in these court cases.” Haley’s administration said the federal government wasn’t doing enough. “If the feds were doing their job, we wouldn’t have had to address illegal immigration reform at the state level,” Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for Haley at the time, said in a statement after a federal judge blocked part of the Act 69. “But, until they do, we’re going to keep fighting in SouthCarolina to be able to enforce our laws.” A softer touch Haley has advocated a hardline immigration policy with less of the inflammatory language used by her peers. She has supported building a wall on the US border with Mexico, adding 25,000 more border patrol and ICE agents, and increasing deportations. But she’s also, over the years, scolded Republican for the language they use to characterize migrants, particularly after Trump called some migrants “rapists” and said they were bringing crime and drugs into the country. Haley tried to strike that balance during a 2015 appearance at the Aspen Institute. Asked about how, as the daughter of Indian immigrants, she viewed the tone of immigration discussions, Haley led by saying America is a country of laws. But she also stressed that America is a country of immigrants. “We don’t need to talk about them as criminals, they’re not,” she said. “They’re families that want a better life, and they’re desperate to get here. What we need to do is make sure that we have a set of laws that we follow.” The first part of that quote was used in a pro-Trump super PAC ad that referred to migrants as “drug traffickers, rapists, poisoning our country” and accused Haley of being soft on criminals. The group, MAGA Inc., aired the ad in New Hampshire ahead of the state’s primary last month. “Nikki Haley: too weak, too liberal to fix the border,” the narrator says. Haley’s 2015 comments came in the wake of the 2012 presidential election, when Republican sought to regain support among Latino voter. Mitt Romney’s loss to former President Barack Obama, a contest Republican thought they could win, set off a round of soul searching in the Republican National Committee that culminated in the 2013 Growth & Opportunity Project report, also known as the RNC autopsy. “As we studied what happened in the 2012 election, it became really pretty clear that a lot of voter just didn’t think Republican particularly cared about them,” said Henry Barbour, a longtime RNC committeeman from Mississippi and co-author of the report. The autopsy advised Republican to push for comprehensive immigration reform, craft a message that acknowledges the unique perspective of the Latino community and take better care in how messaging was relayed. “The Republican Party is one of tolerance and respect, and we need to ensure that the tone of our message is always reflective of these core principles,” it read. Then came Trump. While the former president was able to appeal to working class voter, a group the report didn’t address, his 2016 campaign rejected many of the recommendations about where the party should go. Barbour, who donated to Haley after Trump vowed that anyone who contributed to her would be “permanently barred from the MAGA camp,” described Haley as “clear eyed” about threats at the border without being exclusionary or divisive. There is still a place in the Republican Party for an approach like hers, he said. “I think there’s a lot of room for somebody who’s going to be more inclusive,” he said. “Practice the politics of addition – as opposed to the politics of division – but yet be conservative.”","['months', 'first', 'term', 'governor', 'nikki', 'haley', 'signed', 'one', 'strictest', 'immigration', 'bills',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/politics/kevin-mccarthy-foes-blowback/index.html,"Watch CNN’s coverage of the eight House Republican who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy on “Inside Politics Sunday with Manu Raju” at 11 a.m. ET. CNN — Donors no longer want to contribute to their campaigns. Primary opponents are lining up to take them out. And some of them have been ex-communicated from caucuses on Capitol Hill. The eight House Republican who took the unprecedented step of removing Kevin McCarthy from the speakership are facing blowback, both in Washington and back home. It’s a sign that even four months after the historic move, emotions are still raw inside a GOP conference that is continuing to reel from McCarthy’s ouster. Reps. Nancy Mace of SouthCarolina and Bob Good of Virginia have arguably received the most incoming fire, with both now facing serious primary threats as they gear up for reelection. And Rep. Matt Rosendale, who recently jumped into the US Senate race in Montana , is facing headwinds in GOP circles — in part because of his vote to boot McCarthy — as top Republican fear he will cost them a pivotal seat. A well-connected GOP outside spending group is planning to play in the races against Good and Mace, while McCarthy himself is widely expected to get involved as well, according to multiple Republican sources familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, the Main Street Caucus and Republican Governance Group, two center-right-leaning groups on Capitol Hill, have both quietly dropped Mace from their ranks, multiple sources told CNN. Neither move was publicized, but sources say frustration with the congresswoman had been brewing for months leading up to her McCarthy vote. “She really wants to be a caucus of one. So we obliged her,” one House Republican told CNN. For their part, Mace and Good are both downplaying the threats and expressing no regret about their vote. They are also leaning into the image of being Washington outsiders, which they believe will play well with the GOP base in their respective districts. “I’m too busy working for the Lowcountry and helping elect Trump to worry about Kevin McCarthy’s puppet,” Mace said of one of her primary opponents. “The DC swamp doesn’t want me back — too bad. I don’t work for them, I work for the people of the 1st Congressional District and no one else.” Notably, Good still has support from his colleagues in the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, where he was recently elevated to chairman . But his controversial behavior, including his decision to endorse Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over former Trump for president, still rankled some in the group, as CNN previously reported . Good said he was not concerned about the impact of his McCarthy vote. “I think he should bring McCarthy to campaign for him down in the district,” Good said of his primary foe. Good and Mace aren’t the only ones who find themselves targeted. Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told CNN some “very wealthy folks” shut their wallets to him in the aftermath of his vote. “They’ve been very kind to me in the past, and I hope that we can mend the fences,” Burchett said. “I can get them back in the fold. But if I don’t, I’m still friends with them. I’m not vindictive.” At least one Republican opponent had considered challenging Burchett, though ultimately opted not to last week. Still, Burchett — who said he “caught grief” for initially supporting McCarthy in January 2023 — acknowledged he could face McCarthy-fueled opposition in the August primary. “He’s got to do something with that $17 million he has, so it’ll be eight of us that probably feel the brunt of that,” Burchett said of McCarthy, who left Congress at the end of last year. “I knew exactly what I was doing. I knew I’d get opposition because of it. I still think it’s the right thing to do.” And Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a former Freedom Caucus chairman, also told CNN he has experienced some backlash, including some GOP donors giving him the cold shoulder. But Biggs said the lawmakers — who have become known as the “Gaetz Eight,” since Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida was their ringleader — were prepared to have a target on their backs after they made their momentous decision to boot McCarthy halfway through the congressional session. “We knew that that was a risk,” Biggs told CNN. “But I’m gonna be doing everything I can to help Bob and Nancy. You know, Nancy and I don’t agree a lot. But we do agree on other issues. And I think she tries to represent her constituents.” As the eight have become persona non grata on the Capitol, they are now banding together and vowing to help protect one another. There are also signs that the current Republican leadership team, under Speaker Mike Johnson, will have their backs. “McCarthy couldn’t beat us in Washington, DC, on his home turf, where he has all the king’s horses and all the king’s men,” Gaetz told CNN. “He thinks he’s going to beat us on away games?” But while Gaez saw a big fundraising boost in the final quarter of last year — raising $1.8 million, up from $770,000 the previous quarter — others in the group took a hit. Rosendale posted his lowest numbers of the year in the final quarter, raising just $98,000. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from SouthCarolina, talks to reporters outside the US Capitol on November 1, 2023. Drew Angerer/Getty Images McCarthy’s revenge tour takes shape Behind the scenes, McCarthy allies have been quietly working to exact electoral revenge on the Gaetz Eight, attempting to identify strong primary opponents. Brian O. Walsh, a GOP political consultant and McCarthy ally, has been leading the effort to recruit potential challengers, according to GOP sources familiar with the matter. Politico was the first to report Walsh’s involvement. While McCarthy himself is not yet directly involved, multiple Republican expect the former speaker — who is still connected to a wealthy network of donors — to channel his powerful resources against Mace and Good. “If I’m those folks, one of the things that would scare the crap out of me more than anything else is an unhinged McCarthy,” one GOP lawmaker told CNN. “The guy’s the most prolific fundraiser, you’ve got a massive group of donors across the country that are pissed off about what’s happening, and you’ve got these boneheads that have caused it.” Among the most promising candidates: Catherine Templeton, an attorney and businesswoman who recently announced a bid against Mace, and John McGuire, a Navy SEAL and state representative who is challenging Good. Sources close to both of them, however, say they have not met with McCarthy and insisted they entered their races for other reasons. Still, there’s interest in McCarthy world in helping them succeed: Jeff Miller, a longtime friend and adviser to McCarthy, has donated to McGuire’s campaign, a source familiar with the effort said. And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a McCarthy ally, has formally endorsed McGuire, as well as Tim Sheehy , whom Rosendale will face in the Montana Senate primary. When asked whether he’s worried about McCarthy or his allies coming after him, Rosendale told CNN: “I’m not worried about anybody from California coming out to Montana to campaign.” In other cases, though, the recruitment effort has been less successful. Some of McCarthy’s associates have inquired about whether Mark Lamb , who is running for Senate in Arizona, would challenge Rep. Eli Crane, a member of the Gaetz Eight. But Lamb is close to Crane and Gaetz, and is uninterested in taking on Crane, according to a GOP source close to the situation. Crane told CNN he hasn’t seen any backlash from his Arizona constituents, saying: “My voter are very supportive of it.” But he also said he’s losing donors because of his vote, even as he said he mostly relies on small donors to help build his campaign. “Yeah, that’s definitely a reality,” Crane told CNN of losing donors. “And I think that anybody that participated in that knew that going forward.“ Crane, however, said he had no regrets. “I didn’t come here to play it safe or become a chairman of a committee,” the freshman Republican said. “I came here to make change. And when you do that, sometimes it means the runway’s going to be a little shorter and you might go home. But we need people up here right now who have courage.” Sources said there’s also been an effort to find a veteran to take on Gaetz in his Florida district, which has a heavy military population, but an interested candidate has yet to emerge. Plus, McCarthy’s camp sees Gaetz as more difficult to defeat. However, Mace — who has taken other controversial moves and has experienced a high level of staff turnover in recent months — is seen as easier to topple. McCarthy, who spent significant money to help Mace get elected, felt particularly burned by the congresswoman’s vote to depose him, according to sources close to the former speaker. McCarthy has left the door open to backing primary challengers against the Gaetz Eight, and has talked highly of McGuire in public appearances. In an interview with CNN following his ouster, McCarthy unloaded on his foes, saying there needs to be “consequences” and arguing Mace doesn’t deserve to be reelected. He echoed a similar sentiment to reporters last week at Trump Nevada caucuses watch party in Las Vegas. “If you’ve watched, just her philosophy and the flip-flopping, I don’t believe she wins reelection,” McCarthy told CNN. “I don’t think she’ll probably have earned the right to get reelected.” Rep. Bob Good, a Republican from Virginia, conducts a television interview in Washington, DC, on May 30, 2023. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty Images The Gaetz Eight get back up Johnson, however, has shown no animosity toward the McCarthy rebels, and is expected to support their reelection races. On Friday, the speaker even held a fundraiser for Burchett in his district, according to the Tennessee Republican, amid a broader swing through the state. Republican think part of Johnson’s strategy is rooted in member management: Not only does he want to heal the wounds inside the conference, but doling out valuable chits to these members could help prevent them from acting out. To that end, Johnson announced last week that he plans to donate to Rosendale’s Senate campaign , though he is not making any endorsement after facing blowback for his initial plans to do so. Notably, Rosendale supported an Israel aid package on the floor last week, even as other members of the Freedom Caucus railed against it because it was not paid for. “The speaker has committed to sending a contribution to Congressman Rosendale, as he has for other House colleagues and friends, but he has not made any endorsements in Senate races,” said Greg Steele, the communications director for Johnson’s political team. Meanwhile, the House GOP’s campaign arm has a policy of protecting the conference’s members. And the Gaetz Eight are no exception. “We are an incumbent-driven organization and support all House Republican incumbents call,” said a spokesman for the National Republican Campaign

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/10/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-gaza-israel-arab-americans/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ plans to meet with members of the Arab American community were abruptly postponed this week after leaders decided not to move forward, according to two sources familiar with the situation, marking the latest sign of the obstacles the administration faces in trying to make inroads with the community. Biden and Vice President Harris have been dogged by protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza at events nationwide , underscoring a persistent reality as the president shifts into general election mode: Democrat are deeply divided on Biden support for Israel as it wages war with Hamas, and the issue threatens to split the coalition . Earlier in the week, the vice president’s office held a virtual meeting with around a dozen participants from the Arab American community — including activists and representative organizations — to discuss topics, including the crisis in Gaza, ahead of a listening session with Harris at the White House that was scheduled for Monday, one source said. The following day, those participants called off the Monday session, citing concerns including potential backlash from allies and not wanting to speak for entire communities. Conversations about potentially rescheduling are ongoing, sources said. The now-postponed meeting, which has not been previously reported, is part of a concerted effort by the administration to hear from members of the Arab American community, including this past week in Michigan after a push by leaders and activists to meet with White House officials. A White House official told CNN the vice president “looks forward to continuing to engage with leaders of the Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities, including through phone calls and meetings.” “The vice president is committed to listening to and having a dialogue with members of these communities, and we look forward to meeting with these leaders in the future,” the official said, adding that Harris has spoken to people who have left Gaza, people contributing to the humanitarian response and others. The community members invited to Monday’s session maintained they want to keep lines of communication with the White House open, but the episode served as yet another reminder of the challenges the administration is confronting. It also comes as Harris faces protesters on her reproductive freedoms tour , including one group declining to participate over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza . ACCESS Reproductive Justice, a California-based nonprofit focused on abortion access, decided not to attend Harris’ San Jose stop. “We feel very strongly that the plight of the Palestinian people is very much a reproductive justice issue and quite frankly ignored by the Biden-Harris administration,” Jessica Pinckney Gil, executive director of ACCESS RJ, told CNN. Gil stressed that the group is staying in contact with the vice president’s office despite its decision not to attend the event. “For us, being at the event was supporting policies that we can’t fully support, whereas continuing to be in dialogue with the administration is pushing for policy change,” she said. Sources told CNN that Harris’ staff, at the vice president’s direction, have offered those protesting at her events an opportunity to speak directly with senior White House officials to share their concerns. Harris was interrupted during remarks in San Jose in January as she participated in a moderated discussion about abortion rights with actress Sophia Bush. A protester could be heard calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. And this week, Harris was interrupted by a protester during her speech in Savannah, Georgia. A few minutes into her speech, a protester yelled, “Shame on you” and “You’re committing genocide,” referring to the violence that is unfolding in Gaza . Harris responded by saying, “We know in a healthy democracy we value the freedom of all people to be heard, but right now we are talking about … what has happened to the women and people of America as a result of the Dobbs decision,” referring to the SupremeCourt decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. A member of the Harris team spoke with the demonstrator in Georgia, the White House official said. A recent CNN poll found 34% of Americans approve of Biden handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. About half of Democrat — 51% — say they approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war; among Democrat younger than 45, that falls to just 35%. This week, senior administration officials met with members of the Arab American and Muslim communities in the battleground state of Michigan. Asked about that meeting, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, “We want to hear directly from them,” adding that it’s important for community leaders “to be able to speak directly to officials in the White House.” The Michigan meeting came after Biden campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, traveled to the state to meet with local community leaders, including members of the Arab American and Muslim communities. One sit-down, which was expected to include roughly a dozen Arab American, Muslim, and Palestinian leaders and activists, was called off last month when invitees declined to attend . At the time, some expressed frustration that the Biden team had sent a campaign official instead of White House officials. “The president’s refusal to change course or even to publicly acknowledge his mistakes is a grave insult to people here in Michigan, to Michigan Democrat in particular,” Abbas Alawieh, spokesperson of “Listen to Michigan,” said Friday. Listen to Michigan is a new campaign urging Democrat to vote “Uncommitted” in the state’s February 27 presidential primary to demand Biden support a ceasefire. “And the hypocrisy of telling us privately that the administration has made mistakes while continuing to fail to hold Netanyahu accountable publicly, it’s a blatant display of moral bankruptcy that will have political consequences here in Michigan,” Alawieh said.","['vice', 'president', 'kamala', 'harris’', 'plans', 'meet', 'members', 'arab', 'american', 'community', 'abruptly', 'postponed', 'week', 'leaders', 'decided',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/10/politics/trump-south-carolina-primary-haley/index.html,"Trump used a rally in SouthCarolina on Saturday to attack rival Nikki Haley in her home state — and to mock the absence of her husband, who is deployed overseas. “Where’s her husband? Oh, he’s away. … What happened to her husband? Where is he? He’s gone,” Trump said at his rally in Conway, his first visit to the state this year. Michael Haley is deployed in Africa with the SouthCarolina Army National Guard in support of the United States Africa Command, his second active-duty deployment overseas. Nikki Haley fired back at Trump comments later Saturday, saying, “If you mock the service of a combat veteran, you don’t deserve a driver’s license, let alone being president of the United States.” “Donald, if you have something to say, don’t say it behind my back; get on a debate stage and say it to my face,” she told a crowd in Gilbert, SouthCarolina. In a rare move, Michael Haley fired back at the former president, posting a meme on Twitter reading, “The difference between humans and animals? Animals would never allow the dumbest ones to lead the pack,” while mentioning Trump account in the caption. Notably, former first lady Melania Trump has not joined her husband for any public campaign events since his presidential announcement in November 2022 and has not appeared alongside him at any of his court appearances. Following overwhelming victories in four early presidential nominating contests, Trump has become more emboldened by his staying power as the GOP front-runner. The former president and his campaign are more confident than ever that he will clinch enough delegates by mid-March to declare him the presumptive Republican nominee over former SouthCarolina Gov. Haley — months before the GOP national convention in July, multiple Trump campaign advisers told CNN. Trump SouthCarolina stop came on the heels of a busy few days of travel. He appeared in Nevada on Thursday to declare victory in the state’s GOP caucuses before traveling to Pennsylvania, where he addressed a friendly crowd at a National Rifle Association forum Friday. Thursday saw several positive developments for Trump, including the gift of new campaign fodder against Biden following the release of a searing special counsel report . While the report didn’t recommend charges against Biden, it included damning language about his mishandling of classified documents and raised concerns about his memory and age . The SupremeCourt listens to oral arguments from Jason Murray, the attorney representing a group of Colorado voter challenging Trump's eligibility for the 2024 ballot, on February 8. Bill Hennessy Related article John Roberts has a united court on Trump. Now comes the hard part Also Thursday, the SupremeCourt appeared primed to side with Trump and dismiss an attempt in Colorado to declare him an insurrectionist and remove him for the state’s presidential ballot. Haley has insisted she plans to stay in the race through her home state’s February 24 primary and beyond — buoyed by her enduring fundraising prowess. But Trump and his team view the Palmetto State primary as the place they will deliver the final blow to his last-standing major rival. That confidence stems in part from Trump continued success in internal and public polls, which have consistently shown him with staggering leads over Haley at the national and state levels. That optimistic view of the remaining 2024 primary contests has led Trump campaign to take a less aggressive approach to the SouthCarolina primary, especially compared with the intensity of their ground game and get-out-the-vote strategies in the earlier nominating states. And unlike the weeks leading up to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, when Trump and his campaign relentlessly crisscrossed the states and poured millions into advertising against his rivals, Trump has had a comparably lighter schedule in SouthCarolina. Saturday’s rally in Conway, about 15 miles from Myrtle Beach, was Trump first visit to the state in 77 days. He plans to host several more campaign events in the state before the February 24 primary, but his team has had a more laid-back attitude toward the contest as it increasingly focuses its attention on the looming general election rematch with Biden. Trump advisers insist that doesn’t mean he’s taking SouthCarolina for granted. “At the end of the day, we can’t take any state for granted. But we see this as a done deal,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN, referring specifically to SouthCarolina. The Trump campaign’s ground game efforts in SouthCarolina this year are also substantially more sophisticated than they were during his initial presidential run in 2016, his advisers say, thanks in large part to the team they’ve built under the leadership of senior adviser Susie Wiles . The campaign has staff spread out across SouthCarolina’s 46 counties, dispatched mailers touting Trump candidacy and deployed top state lawmakers and surrogates — including Gov. Henry McMaster; US Sen. Tim Scott , a former presidential rival; and several top members of the state’s congressional delegation — to attack Haley in her own backyard. “Nikki is persona non grata at this point,” Justin Evans, Trump director of special projects in SouthCarolina, told CNN. “Nikki represents the brand of Republicanism that Trump stands against; everything the George Bush-Karl Rove wing of the party is embodied in Nikki Haley and represented by Nikki Haley. This is their last gasp, and they know that if they lose this, they’re going to have almost an impossible task of regaining any kind of foothold not only in this election, but in the party.” Michael Whatley, North Carolina Republican Party Chairman, speaks during a campaign event for Trump in Dallas, North Carolina, in October 2020. Al Drago/Reuters Related article Likely frontrunner for RNC chair parroted Trump 2020 election lies Trump ramped up his attacks against Haley during his Saturday speech, calling her “brain dead” and saying he thought the former SouthCarolina governor would not pass a cognitive test. His assertion came hours after Haley’s campaign handed out mental competency tests during her campaign stop in Newberry, SouthCarolina. Haley, 52, has questioned Trump mental fitness and has called for mental competency tests for any politician over the age of 75. Trump is 77 and Biden is 81. “The radical-left Democrat want Nikki Haley because they know that she’s easy to beat,” Trump said Saturday as he flexed his lead in polling. Those remarks reflect the broader view of Trump campaign, which wants him to become the presumptive GOP nominee as soon as possible. According to multiple conversations with Trump advisers, they are eager to use the full weight of the GOP infrastructure, including that of the Republican National Committee , to begin pivoting in earnest toward a general election fight against Biden. Haley, for her part, seems unaffected by the pressure. A day after losing to “none of these candidates” in Nevada’s nonbinding primary Tuesday, she held a fundraiser and a rally in California, one of several Super Tuesday states she plans to compete in next month, urging voter to stick with her. In both private and public conversations, Haley has insisted she has no plans to drop out of the race anytime soon — and says she’s committed to competing against Trump through Super Tuesday on March

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/10/politics/senate-afghan-evacuees-residency/index.html,"As the Senate continues its debate over a national security supplemental funding bill , advocates are calling on lawmakers to approve an amendment that would give Afghans who were evacuated during the US’ withdrawal of Afghanistan a path to permanent legal residency in the US. The amendment, introduced by Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Republican Sen. Jerry Moran on Friday, would “allow Afghan allies to apply for permanent legal residency to provide certainty as they build their lives in the United States after undergoing thorough vetting,” according to a news release from Klobuchar. It is based on the bipartisan Afghan Adjustment Act, which was reintroduced last year. The amendment was introduced Friday with a list of co-sponsors that included Republican Sens. Roger Wicker, Lindsey Graham and Thom Tillis, as well as Democrat Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Chris Coons and Jeanne Shaheen. Speaking on the Senate floor Friday, Klobuchar said there are roughly 80,000 Afghan refugees in the US who “served as interpreters, they served as intel gatherers, they put their own lives and their families’ lives at risk.” The amendment has “a heavy-duty vetting process,” Klobuchar said, adding that “the vast majority of these people are here already.” “Are we going to send these people who stood with our troops back to the arms of the Taliban?” Klobuchar said. “Or are we going to do what’s right?” Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac — a coalition of organizations that assisted in evacuating Afghans during the 2021 withdrawal — told CNN the war in Afghanistan and the “obligation that we have to our allies is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem.” “It’s an American problem. It’s an American obligation. And our allies are watching. Future conflicts that we go into will look back to how we handled the end of the Afghan war and what we did with our Afghan allies,” VanDiver said. It’s unclear whether the amendment will get a vote to be included in the supplemental bill, but advocates say it’s a critical next step for Afghans who have been in limbo since arriving in the US after the chaotic withdrawal. While the amendment has bipartisan backing, at least one Republican is expected to object to it. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Army veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, “disagrees with some elements of Sen. Klobuchar’s bill,” a person familiar with his thinking told CNN. Among those objections are the “lack of parole reform,” protection for Afghans he says did not work with US forces, and “the potential for abuse of virtually unlimited and unvetted family migration,” the person familiar said. “Sen. Cotton supports helping our Afghan allies and partners, but this specific bill did little to address his concerns,” the person said. The source also said Cotton supports “a version of this bill and even has his own version of this bill,” referencing a bill he introduced in July 2023. VanDiver criticized Cotton directly in posts on X on Friday night, saying he is “abandoning our allies” after Cotton and his team had “worked to get the very folks this would help here to the US.” VanDiver later told CNN that Cotton is using Afghans “as political pawns.” “I remember August 2021. I remember Tom Cotton talking about this, helping people, asking veterans groups for help to get the people that he was working with through the airport gates and on the planes,” VanDiver said. “And all of those people that he helped, who are here and waiting for the Afghan Adjustment Act or the adjustment of status — he’s abandoning them.” Moran, who is the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, said Saturday that many Afghan allies are “still overseas, and those who made it to the US face uncertainty as to whether they will be granted permanent residency.” “I urge my colleagues to support the inclusion of the Afghan Adjustment Act in the national security supplemental to grant Afghan refugees stability, bolster our national security and send a message to US partners and allies that we will honor our word,” Moran said. Patrick Murray, the director of national legislative services for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in a statement that the VFW “wants to see those Afghan allies who stood alongside our troops taken care of and provided the safety they deserve.”","['senate', 'continues', 'debate', 'national', 'security', 'supplemental', 'funding', 'bill', 'advocates', 'calling', 'lawmakers', 'approve', 'amendment', 'give', 'afghans', 'evacuated', 'us’', 'withdrawal', 'afghanistan', 'path', 'permanent', 'legal', 'residency', 'us', 'amendment', 'introduced', 'democrat', 'sen', 'amy', 'klobuchar', 'republican', 'sen', 'jerry', 'moran', 'friday', '“allow', 'afghan', 'allies', 'apply', 'permanent', 'legal', 'residency', 'provide', 'certainty', 'build', 'lives', 'united', 'states', 'undergoing', 'thorough', 'vetting”', 'according', 'release', 'klobuchar', 'based', 'bipartisan', 'afghan', 'adjustment', 'act', 'reintroduced', 'last', 'year', 'amendment', 'introduced', 'friday', 'list', 'cosponsors', 'included', 'republican', 'sens', 'roger', 'wicker', 'lindsey', 'graham', 'thom', 'tillis', 'well', 'democrat', 'sens', 'richard', 'blumenthal', 'chris', 'coons', 'jeanne', 'shaheen', 'speaking', 'senate', 'floor', 'friday', 'klobuchar', 'roughly', '80000', 'afghan', 'refugees', 'us', '“served', 'interpreters', 'served', 'intel', 'gatherers', 'put', 'lives', 'families’', 'lives', 'risk”', 'amendment', '“a', 'heavyduty', 'vetting', 'process”', 'klobuchar', 'adding', '“the', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'already”', '“are', 'going', 'send', 'people', 'stood', 'troops', 'back', 'arms', 'taliban”', 'klobuchar', '“or', 'going', 'what’s', 'right”', 'shawn', 'vandiver', 'founder', 'afghanevac', 'coalition', 'organizations', 'assisted', 'evacuating', 'afghans', '2021', 'withdrawal', 'war', 'afghanistan', '“obligation', 'allies', 'republican', 'problem', 'democrat', 'problem”', '“it’s', 'american', 'problem', 'american', 'obligation', 'allies', 'watching', 'future', 'conflicts', 'go', 'look', 'back', 'handled', 'end', 'afghan', 'war', 'afghan', 'allies”', 'vandiver', 'unclear', 'whether', 'amendment', 'vote', 'included', 'supplemental', 'bill', 'advocates', 'say', 'critical', 'next', 'step', 'afghans', 'limbo', 'since', 'arriving', 'us', 'chaotic', 'withdrawal', 'amendment', 'bipartisan', 'backing', 'least', 'one', 'republican', 'expected', 'object', 'sen', 'tom', 'cotton', 'army', 'veteran', 'member', 'senate', 'armed', 'services', 'committee', '“disagrees', 'elements', 'sen', 'klobuchar’s', 'bill”', 'person', 'familiar', 'thinking', 'among', 'objections', '“lack', 'parole', 'reform”', 'protection', 'afghans', 'work', 'us', 'forces', '“the', 'potential', 'abuse', 'virtually', 'unlimited', 'unvetted', 'family', 'migration”', 'person', 'familiar', '“sen', 'cotton', 'supports', 'helping', 'afghan', 'allies', 'partners', 'specific', 'bill', 'little', 'address', 'concerns”', 'person', 'source', 'cotton', 'supports', '“a', 'version', 'bill', 'version', 'bill”', 'referencing', 'bill', 'introduced', 'july', '2023', 'vandiver', 'criticized', 'cotton', 'directly', 'posts', 'x', 'friday', 'night', 'saying', '“abandoning', 'allies”', 'cotton', 'team', '“worked', 'folks', 'help', 'us”', 'vandiver', 'later', 'cotton', 'using', 'afghans', '“as', 'political', 'pawns”', 'remember', 'august', '2021', 'remember', 'tom', 'cotton', 'talking', 'helping', 'people', 'asking', 'veterans', 'groups', 'help', 'people', 'working', 'airport', 'gates', 'planes”', 'vandiver', '“and', 'people', 'helped', 'waiting', 'afghan', 'adjustment', 'act', 'adjustment', 'status', 'he’s', 'abandoning', 'them”', 'moran', 'ranking', 'member', 'senate', 'committee', 'veterans’', 'affairs', 'saturday', 'many', 'afghan', 'allies', '“still', 'overseas', 'made', 'us', 'face', 'uncertainty', 'whether', 'granted', 'permanent', 'residency”', 'urge', 'colleagues', 'support', 'inclusion', 'afghan', 'adjustment', 'act', 'national', 'security', 'supplemental', 'grant', 'afghan', 'refugees', 'stability', 'bolster', 'national', 'security', 'send', 'message', 'us', 'partners', 'allies', 'honor', 'word”', 'moran', 'patrick', 'murray', 'director', 'national', 'legislative', 'services', 'veterans', 'foreign', 'wars', 'statement', 'vfw', '“wants', 'see', 'afghan', 'allies', 'stood', 'alongside', 'troops', 'taken', 'care', 'provided', 'safety', 'deserve”']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/10/politics/donald-trump-robert-hur-joe-biden-report/index.html,"Trump on Saturday ramped up his criticism of special counsel Robert Hur’s decision not to charge Biden over his handling of classified documents , while repeatedly questioning his successor’s mental acuity and peddling conspiratorial claims about former President Barack Obama. Less than two days after the release of Hur’s report, Trump is trying to weaponize its language – which described Biden as forgetful and said he acted improperly, though not criminally – to cast doubt over the president’s mental fitness and accuse the Justice Department of bias. The long riffs also serve to deflect from Trump own, more serious legal concerns – which Hur, in his report, outlined in damning terms. In a scattershot speech to supporters in SouthCarolina, Trump rolled out a wave of attacks on Biden. He claimed his rival was effectively incapacitated, operating under the influence of Obama – “I think Barack Obama has a lot to do with running the country right now,” Trump said. He also portrayed the president as the leader of a nefarious plot to derail Trump campaign with politically motivated criminal accusations, investigations and indictments. “If Biden is not fit to charge, they are not going to judge him with a crime, but it’s OK for him to become commander in chief?” Trump said. “Biden is bad for democracy because he’s grossly incompetent. … Plus, he uses DOJ and FBI and everything he can to go after an opponent and nothing has ever happened like that in this country.” Biden has repeatedly said he would not instruct his Justice Department to investigate Trump nor push for any outcome if Attorney General Merrick Garland went forward – as he has – with probes into the former president. Garland and others in the DOJ have also said they are working independent of the White House. The former president, flipping his own script, also said Biden was actually worse off not being charged because of the language used by Hur to describe the president’s forgetfulness. “Crooked Joe got off scot-free and I don’t know if you call it scot-free. They said he was a mental basket case,” Trump said. In actuality, Hur framed his report around the reasons h e did not believe a jury would convict Biden , whom he said would likely portray himself as an “elderly man with a poor memory” in a bid to win jurors’ sympathy. Republican have long drawn parallels between Hur’s investigation and that of special counsel Jack Smith, despite critical differences in the two cases. Hur was careful to note the distinction in his report – specifying that Biden cooperated with the investigation and returned the documents, while Trump did not return his documents and, when asked, sought to cover it up. “Most notably, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite.” Hur wrote. “According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it.” Hur added: “In contrast, Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview, and in other ways cooperated with the investigation.” Earlier on Saturday, the White House responded with a memo citing examples of Biden being described as “sharp” and “alert.” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates singled out a series of notable individuals who have met with Biden recently and described him as engaged – among them the father of a freed hostage, former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – and listed the administration’s accomplishments on infrastructure and the economy. “This undeniable record speaks to why it’s no surprise that Republican officials’ continue their desperate – and inadvertently self-undermining – age attacks after many years of failure: they’re afraid of Biden,” Bates wrote. Bates also sought to use the recent GOP crack-up over a bipartisan border and foreign aid bill as an example of the president’s sharpness and undiminished political nous. “This week alone, Biden again outmaneuvered congressional Republican on a key issue, border security, leaving opponents of the bipartisan deal openly citing Trump for why they’re siding with fentanyl traffickers over the Border Patrol,” the memo reads. Some Biden allies have also argued that Trump own flubs and garbled statements are much worse and concerning than the president’s missteps. “Every single time Trump opens his mouth, he’s confused, deranged, lying, or worse,” Biden campaign spokesperson TJ Ducklo said Friday after Trump spoke at a National Rifle Association event in Pennsylvania.“Tonight, he lied more than two dozen times, slurred his words, confused basic facts, and placated the gun lobby weeks after telling parents to ‘get over it’ after their kids were gunned down at school.” Trump and his allies, though, are moving forward with a new campaign of sorts to drum up doubts over Biden competence. On Friday, a pro-Trump super PAC put out a new ad – that Trump posted on his Truth Social platform – blasting Biden with similar accusations and a claim that the 81-year-old president is “unfit to stand trial” and “unfit to lead America.” “It’s official: Biden mishandled classified documents and how his two-tiered justice system is on full display,” the MAGA Inc","['trump', 'saturday',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/10/politics/trump-foreign-aid-loan-senate-package/index.html,"The day before the Senate is set to begin voting on a $95.3 billion foreign aid package that would provide for Israel and Ukraine, former Trump on Saturday said the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is structured as a loan. “WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE MONEY ANYMORE WITHOUT THE HOPE OF A PAYBACK, OR WITHOUT“STRINGS” ATTACHED. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE “STUPID” NO LONGER!” Trump posted Saturday on Truth Social. Trump comments come after he launched a torrent of attacks on a $118 billion bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package that Senate Republican ended up blocking Wednesday. It was a stunning rebuke of legislation that would have enacted restrictive border measures and was crafted in part by one of their own members — James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the chamber’s most conservative senators. The former president’s comments Saturday suggest the new foreign aid package, on which the Senate is slated to begin procedural vote Sunday , will end up similarly torpedoed . Trump celebrated the failure of the $118 billion bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package at a rally on Saturday. “This week we also had another massive victory that every conservative should celebrate: we crushed Crooked Biden disastrous open borders bill. Crushed it,” Trump told the crowd in Conway, SouthCarolina. The deal would have provided aid to key US allies abroad, including billions of dollars to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia and security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine. Republican had demanded that border security be part of that bill, but rejected it after pressure from Trump , who is making the US southern border a central campaign issue in his race for the White House. Democrat have expressed outrage at Republican for lining up in opposition to the border deal, arguing that they cannot be trusted as negotiating partners and saying that they are bowing to pressure from Trump to keep the border in the political spotlight. The $95.3 billion foreign aid package the Senate is currently working to pass was advanced on Thursday on a tally of 67 to 32. The new bill may face obstacles beyond Trump signaling opposition, specifically Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — who has long opposed foreign aid — using chamber rules to slow its progress . Without an agreement from all 100 senators to speed up the process and swiftly pass the legislation, the Senate is expected to work through the weekend, with a final vote next week. “I think we should stay here as long as it takes,” Paul told CNN’s Manu Raju on Thursday. “If it takes a week or a month, I’ll force them to stay here to discuss why they think the border of Ukraine is more important than the US border.” If the bill is eventually passed by the Senate, it would next go to the House, where it’s unclear when or whether Speaker Mike Johnson would hold a vote on it. Many House Republican are opposed to further aid to Ukraine. The new foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine. The bill includes $60 billion to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia, $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel, $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance and $4.8 billion to support regional partners in the Indo-Pacific region, among other provisions, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee.","['day', 'senate', 'set', 'begin', 'voting', '953', 'billion', 'foreign', 'aid', 'package', 'provide', 'israel', 'ukraine', 'trump', 'saturday', 'us', 'stop', 'providing', 'foreign', 'aid', 'unless', 'structured', 'loan', '“we', 'never', 'give', 'money', 'anymore', 'without', 'hope', 'payback', 'without“strings”', 'attached', 'united', 'states', 'america', '“stupid”', 'longer”', 'trump', 'posted', 'saturday', 'truth', 'social', 'trump', 'comments', 'come', 'launched', 'torrent', 'attacks', '118', 'billion', 'bipartisan', 'border', 'deal', 'foreign', 'aid', 'package', 'senate', 'republican', 'ended', 'blocking', 'wednesday', 'stunning', 'rebuke', 'legislation', 'enacted', 'restrictive', 'border', 'measures', 'crafted', 'part', 'one', 'members', 'james', 'lankford', 'oklahoma', 'one', 'chamber’s', 'conservative', 'senators', 'president’s', 'comments', 'saturday', 'suggest', 'new', 'foreign', 'aid', 'package', 'senate', 'slated', 'begin', 'procedural', 'vote', 'sunday', 'end', 'similarly', 'torpedoed', 'trump', 'celebrated', 'failure', '118', 'billion', 'bipartisan', 'border', 'deal', 'foreign', 'aid', 'package', 'rally', 'saturday', '“this', 'week', 'another', 'massive', 'victory', 'every', 'conservative', 'celebrate', 'crushed', 'crooked', 'biden', 'disastrous', 'open', 'borders', 'bill', 'crushed', 'it”', 'trump', 'crowd', 'conway', 'southcarolina', 'deal', 'provided', 'aid', 'key', 'us', 'allies', 'abroad', 'including', 'billions', 'dollars', 'support', 'ukraine', 'fight', 'russia', 'security', 'assistance', 'israel', 'well', 'humanitarian', 'assistance', 'civilians', 'gaza', 'west', 'bank', 'ukraine', 'republican', 'demanded', 'border', 'security', 'part', 'bill', 'rejected', 'pressure', 'trump', 'making', 'us', 'southern', 'border', 'central', 'campaign', 'issue', 'race', 'white', 'house', 'democrat', 'expressed', 'outrage', 'republican', 'lining', 'opposition', 'border', 'deal', 'arguing', 'cannot', 'trusted', 'negotiating', 'partners', 'saying', 'bowing', 'pressure', 'trump', 'keep', 'border', 'political', 'spotlight', '953', 'billion', 'foreign', 'aid', 'package', 'senate', 'currently', 'working', 'pass', 'advanced', 'thursday', 'tally', '67', '32', 'new', 'bill', 'may', 'face', 'obstacles', 'beyond', 'trump', 'signaling', 'opposition', 'specifically', 'republican', 'sen', 'rand', 'paul', 'kentucky', 'long', 'opposed', 'foreign', 'aid', 'using', 'chamber', 'rules', 'slow', 'progress', 'without', 'agreement', '100', 'senators', 'speed', 'process', 'swiftly', 'pass', 'legislation', 'senate', 'expected', 'work', 'weekend', 'final', 'vote', 'next', 'week', 'stay', 'long', 'takes”', 'paul', 'cnn’s', 'manu', 'raju', 'thursday', '“if', 'takes', 'week', 'month', 'i’ll', 'force', 'stay', 'discuss', 'border', 'ukraine', 'important', 'us', 'border”', 'bill', 'eventually', 'passed', 'senate', 'next', 'go', 'house', 'unclear', 'whether', 'speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'hold', 'vote', 'many', 'house', 'republican', 'opposed', 'aid', 'ukraine', 'new', 'foreign', 'aid', 'package', 'includes', 'billions', 'dollars', 'support', 'ukraine', 'security', 'assistance', 'israel', 'well', 'humanitarian', 'assistance', 'civilians', 'gaza', 'west', 'bank', 'ukraine', 'bill', 'includes', '60', 'billion', 'support', 'ukraine', 'fight', 'russia', '141', 'billion', 'security', 'assistance', 'israel', '92', 'billion', 'humanitarian', 'assistance', '48', 'billion', 'support', 'regional', 'partners', 'indopacific', 'region', 'among', 'provisions', 'according', 'senate', 'appropriations', 'committee']"

Biden attempted a joke about his memory during a speech in Washington, D.C., Monday, seemingly taking a jab at Special Counsel Robert Hur's report. Delivering remarks at the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference, Biden spoke about his bipartisan infrastructure law, which he credits for allowing his administration to continue ""making the biggest investment in climate change ever anywhere in the entire world."" ""After devastating floods, tornadoes, wildfires and hurricane, we're going to keep working together to respond, to rebuild and boost resilience to extreme weather. My administration is also helping install rooftop solar to build a national network of electric vehicle charging stations for revitalizing fenceline communities smothered by the legacy of pollution like where I lived in Claymont,"" Biden said, referring to where his family moved in Delaware during the early 1950s. ""We're promoting clean energy in industries of the future made here in America. Made in America,"" he said while transitioning. Biden ALLIES GO ON DEFENSE BLITZ FOLLOWING HUR REPORT: 'BUCKET OF BS' ""What I didn't realize, and I've been around, I know it don't look like it, but I've been around a while. I do remember that,"" Biden said, garnering laughter and applause. Biden gave a speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference, Monday, Feb. 12, 2024, in Washington. The joke was somewhat undercut by Biden concluding the speech – and then adding an interjection at the end, admitting, ""I forgot something,"" before making a final comment. In building his argument for why no charges were recommended following an investigation into Biden's mishandling of classified documents, Hur, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, detailed in part that Biden's defense of any potential charges could possibly be that, ""Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" The report cited examples when investigators said the president's memory lapsed, including over when his older son Beau had died. Biden's age and mental fitness have already been a concern for voter. Biden after delivering remarks to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference, Monday, Feb. 12, 2024, in Washington. MAYORKAS DUCKS RESPONSIBILITY ON BORDER CRISIS, MIGRANT FIGURES: 'CONGRESS IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN FIX THIS' During his speech, Biden also criticized his 2024 rival, former Trump, and Republican for opposing a $118 billion supplemental spending agreement that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as well as an ambitious border security and immigration package. The border package drew widespread opposition from conservative Republican in both chambers since its release just days earlier. The Senate voted against the supplemental 50-49 Wednesday. It needed 60 vote to pass. The vote went mostly along party lines, except for five Democrat voting no and four Republican voting yes. ""Some of my extreme Republican friends – and by the way, this is not your father's Republican Party … I'm not taking on all Republican. I really mean it. The MAGA Republican, a minority, but a powerful minority. They went out and they killed the deal. My predecessor said he didn't like it. It was a loss for him. We have to end the political games, folks,"" Biden said Monday. Biden, left, greets NatCo president and commissioner in Ramsey County, Minnesota, Mary Jo McGuire, before he delivers remarks to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference, Monday, Feb. 12, 2024. The president also claimed a victory for the economy. ""It's clear we have the strongest economy in the world. Nearly 15 million new jobs since I came to office,"" Biden said. ""The longest stretch of under 4% in 50 years. Growth is strong. Rising wages are rising, inflation is down. In fact, the costs have fallen from everything from a gallon of gas to a gallon of milk. We know prices are still too high because of what I call greed-inflation and shrinkflation,"" he said, referring to companies charging the same amount for a product while reducing quantity. ""I'm calling on corporations to pass their savings on to consumers, for God's sake. We're making real progress."" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The recent Washington Post headline summed it up,"" Biden added, quoting the newspaper's story titled, ""Falling Inflation and Rising Growth Give the U.S. the World's Best Recovery.""

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. apologized to members of his family for a surprise Super Bowl ad that heavily featured his connection to his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy. RFK Jr. argued that the group responsible for the ad, the American Values Super PAC, did not consult with him or his campaign when making the ad. RFK Jr., who is running for president as an independent, nevertheless pinned the video to the top of his profile on X. RFK Jr.'s cousin, Bobby Shriver, first complained about the ad in a post Sunday night, writing that his uncles and mother would never have approved of RFK Jr.'s ""deadly health care views."" ""My cousin’s Super Bowl ad used our uncle’s faces- and my Mother’s. She would be appalled by his deadly health care views. Respect for science, vaccines, & health care equity were in her DNA.

Biden LEAD OVER Trump SHRINKS WITH THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES ADDED Biden will not take a cognitive test as part of his upcoming physical exam, the White House confirmed Monday. ""I'm just gonna say what Dr. O'Connor said to me about a year ago when [Biden's physical] was released,"" Jean-Pierre responded. ""The president proves every day [in] how he operates and how he thinks, by dealing with world leaders, by making difficult decisions on behalf of the American people – whether it's domestic or it's national security."" HALEY ARGUES Trump AND Biden ARE ‘GRUMPY OLD MEN’ ""That is how Dr. O'Connor sees it, and that is how I'm going to leave it,"" she added. Reporters pressed Jean-Pierre on Biden's health due to last week's report from Special Counsel Robert Hur that found Biden has significant memory issues. Jean-Pierre gave a more full-throated defense of Biden when reporters continued to press her on the topic. She said she has known Biden for more than a decade and continues to find him to be ""sharp"" and ""on top of things."" ""When we have meetings with him and his staff he is constantly pushing us, trying to get more information, and so that has been my experience with this president,"" she said. Biden's age is a major concern among U.S. voter, 86% of whom say he is too old to serve a second term, according to an ABC poll.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-ready-serve-democrats-sound-alarm-about-bidens-age,"Marc Thiessen questions whether Biden is capable of finishing current term Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the significance of the special counsel's report on Biden's age after a recent poll showed 86% of Americans now believe he is too old to serve as president. Vice President Kamala Harris says she is ""ready to serve"" as concerns over Biden's age and mental fitness continue to grow, notably among members of their own party. Harris made the statement during a a recent interview last week before the Thursday release of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report on Biden's mishandling of classified documents, which described the president’s memory as having ""significant limitations."" ""I am ready to serve. There’s no question about that,"" Harris told The Wall Street Journal , adding that everyone who observes her work ""walks away fully aware of my capacity to lead."" Biden CONSIDERED RESIGNING VICE PRESIDENCY ‘IN PROTEST’ OVER OBAMA'S AFGHANISTAN POLICY: HUR REPORT Biden and Vice President Harris. Hur's report recommended no charges against Biden over his actions pertaining to the mishandling of classified documents, partly because he would have a defense at trial as a ""sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" Republican piled on Biden following the Hur report's release last week, but Democrat have also begun voicing — or at least admitting — greater concern surrounding Biden's age and whether that could hurt his chances at winning re-election this year. Former President Bill Clinton's lead strategist, James Carville, argued Saturday that the White House has little confidence in Biden after he turned down a Super Bowl Sunday interview. TREASURY CONFIRMS TERMS LIKE ‘MAGA,’ Trump,' KAMALA,' ‘Biden’ USED IN PRIVATE BANK TRANSACTION SEARCHES Democrat strategist James Carville. ""It’s the biggest television audience, not even close, and you get a chance to do a 20-25-minute interview on that day,"" Carville said. ""And you don’t do it? That’s a kind of sign that the staff, or yourself, doesn’t have much confidence in you. There’s no other way to read this."" Another former Clinton strategist, Paul Begala, said Hur’s indictment of Biden memory and Biden's subsequent response was ""terrible for Democrat."" ""Oh yeah. Look, I’m a Biden supporter, and I slept like a baby last night: I woke up every two hours crying and wet the bed,"" Begala quipped on CNN last Friday. ""This is terrible for Democrat. And anybody with a functioning brain knows that,"" he declared.

A group of youth climate activists were arrested Monday for blocking the entrance to Biden's campaign headquarters in Delaware while demanding his administration ""end the era of fossil fuels."" According to the left-wing climate group Sunrise Movement, 21 of its members were arrested and roughly 80 others were involved in the protest in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday. The activists warned that, if Biden failed to take definitive action combating climate change, millions of young voter would stay home in November. ""Climate change is at our doorstep. Our homes are flooding, we’re breathing in toxic air, Black people like me are dying while the President expands oil and gas production to record levels,"" Sunrise campaign director Kidus Girma said in a statement after the protest. ""Then Biden goes around and claims he’s a climate president and wants our vote? That’s bulls---."" While Girma failed to specify which actions Biden has taken to boost greater reliance on fossil fuels, the Sunrise Movement has repeatedly called for him to formally declare global warming a national emergency, an action he has resisted throughout his presidency. A climate emergency declaration would enable Biden to bypass Congress and take a number of executive actions not normally granted to the White House. Sunrise Movement activists were arrested Monday for blocking the entrance to Biden's campaign headquarters in Delaware. MODERATE DEMS SILENT AS Biden SKIRTS SENATE CONFIRMATION FOR JOHN KERRY'S REPLACEMENT In addition, the Sunrise Movement broadly opposes all oil, gas and coal development, calling instead for an aggressive nationwide transition to green energy sources like wind and solar. Currently, fossil fuels generate the majority of domestic electricity and support both the transportation and manufacturing sectors in America, according to federal data. ""There are dozens of things he could sign into law tomorrow if he wanted to protect low-income communities of color like mine that live next to fossil fuel sites that are killing us through cancer and asthma,"" Sunrise Movement volunteer Ariela Lara said. ""He could make sure that every time a climate disaster hits, no one gets evicted and everyone has access to free health care,"" she continued. ""He could end the fossil fuel era by refusing to approve a single oil or gas well in this country. Biden can’t build renewables on Monday, build fossil fuels on Tuesday, and then claim to be climate president. That’s not how science works, and young voter know it."" AOC DECLARES VICTORY IN FIGHT FOR GREEN NEW DEAL 5 YEARS LATER: 'SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION' But while Biden has yet to declare a climate emergency , he has repeatedly taken aim at the fossil fuel industry while seeking to boost green energy. Biden delivers remarks during a press conference on the grounds of National Renewable Energy Laboratory on Sept. 14, 2021, in Arvada, Colorado. Shortly after taking office, the president signed executive orders to pause all oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, and canceled permits for the Keystone XL oil pipeline project. Although a federal court eventually intervened to force the Biden administration to continue leasing, it has dragged its feet on holding new lease sales and created regulatory roadblocks for producers. And Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which earmarks tens of billions of dollars for green energy programs. His administration has also unleashed an onslaught of environmental regulations to curb fossil fuel power plant electricity generation, push electric vehicles and incentivize the electrification of the residential sector. ""I mean, it literally is the existential threat. It’s even more consequential than nuclear power, nuclear war,"" he added. ""That would be horrible and awful, and it would just make the environment incredibly worse. But it’s about the environment.""

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-hunter-biden-associate-tony-bobulinski-heads-congress-this-week-biden-impeachment-inquiry,"HunterBiden attorneys try to get gun indictment dismissed Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the first son's legal battles on 'The Story.' Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of HunterBiden, is expected to testify behind closed doors on Capitol Hill Tuesday as the latest witness in the House impeachment inquiry against Biden. A source familiar with the planning first told Fox News Digital that Bobulinski will appear on Tuesday, Feb. 13, at 10 a.m. for a transcribed interview before both the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees. The testimony could last eight hours, according to the source. Bobulinski, who worked with HunterBiden to create the joint-venture SinoHawk Holdings with Chinese energy company CEFC, said he met with Biden in 2017. Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of HunterBiden, speaks to reporters at a hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, on Oct. 22, 2020. Bobulinski, in December, demanded Biden ""stop lying"" about that meeting and called on him to ""correct the record."" ""Why is Biden blatantly lying to the American people and the world by claiming that he did not meet with me face to face?"" Bobulinski told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""He should call his son Hunter and brother Jim as they can remind him of the facts. The American people deserve the truth!"" FLASHBACK: HUNTER Biden BUSINESS ASSOCIATE'S TEXT MESSAGES INDICATE MEETING WITH JOE Biden He added: ""I call on Mr. Biden to stop lying and correct the record."" Biden and son HunterBiden Bobulinski said he is a ""former decorated Naval Officer who was willing to die for this great country and held the highest security clearance issued by the Department of Energy."" Bobulinski worked with HunterBiden to create the joint venture SinoHawk Holdings with Chinese energy company CEFC. Despite Biden recent denials of involvement with his son’s business dealings, text messages dating back to May 2017 reveal that Biden met with Bobulinski months after he left the vice president's office. Fox News Digital first reported on the text messages and that meeting in October 2020. ""Mrng plse let me knw if we will do early dinner w your Uncle & dad and where, also for document translation do you want it simple Chinese or traditional?"" Bobulinski texted HunterBiden on May 2, 2017. Text message ""Not sure on dinner yet and whatever is the most common for a Chinese legal DOC,"" HunterBiden replied. ""Chinese legal docs can be both, i’ll make it traditional,"" Bobulinski said. Hunter replied: ""Dad not in now until 11 – let’s me I and Jim meet at 10 at Beverly Hilton where he’s staying."" Text message BOBULINSKI OFFERED TO TESTIFY AT HUNTER Biden GRAND JURY BUT 'NEVER HEARD BACK': SOURCE Later, Bobulinski sent a text to Jim Biden, Biden's brother, on the same day, May 2, 2017, saying: ""Great to meet u and spend some time together, please thank Joe for his time, was great to talk thx Tony b."" Text message The following day, May 3, 2017, Bobulinski sent another text to Jim Biden, saying: ""Morning, please let me know all set for things this mrng. I don't have credentials to get into Milken so just want to make sure not an issue to get me in, where should we meet this mrng?"" ""Milken"" was in reference to the 2017 Global Conference, which, in part, was held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, according to the program directory. Biden, on May 3, 2017, spoke at the conference, hosting ""A Conversation with the 47th Vice President of the United States Biden."" The meeting on May 2, 2017, would have taken place just 11 days before the now-infamous May 13, 2017, email, which included a discussion of ""remuneration packages"" for six people in a business deal with a Chinese energy firm. The email appeared to identify Biden as ""Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC,"" in a reference to now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co. HUNTER Biden INVESTIGATORS LIMITED QUESTIONS ABOUT 'DAD,' 'BIG GUY' DESPITE FBI, IRS OBJECTIONS: WHISTLEBLOWER The email includes a note that ""Hunter has some office expectations he will elaborate."" A proposed equity split references ""20"" for ""H"" and ""10 held by H for the big guy?"" with no further details. Bobulinski has repeatedly said ""the big guy"" was Biden. IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, who claimed that politics had influenced the years-long federal investigation into HunterBiden, also said ""the big guy"" was known to be Biden. Biden and his son, HunterBiden, step off Air Force One, Feb. 4, 2023, in Syracuse, NewYork. The president, in December, was asked whether he had communicated with his son's business partners. The question came after Fox News Digital first reported that IRS whistleblowers turned over metadata to the House Ways & Means Committee revealing that he had used an email alias to communicate hundreds of times with HunterBiden and his business associate Eric Schwerin during his time as vice president. ""I did not, they’re lies. It’s a bunch of lies,"" Biden said Wednesday at the White House. His suggestion came after HunterBiden’s attorney Abbe Lowell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves, claiming that Bobulinski lied to the FBI during an interview Oct. 23, 2020, about his business dealings with the president’s son. James Biden is set to appear for his deposition on Capitol Hill on Feb. 21. HunterBiden is set to appear on Feb. 28.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-retained-records-related-to-ukraine-china-comer-demands-unfettered-access-amid-impeachment-inquiry,"Biden reacts to the conclusion of the Biden classified documents probe Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the special counsel's report Biden's classified docs on 'Special Report.' Biden retained documents marked ""secret"" and ""confidential"" related to Ukraine and China, according to Special Counsel Robert Hur's report. Hur, who released his report to the public on Thursday after months of investigating, did not recommend criminal charges against Biden for mishandling and retaining classified documents — and stated that he wouldn't bring charges against Biden even if he were not in the Oval Office. Those records included classified documents about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan and other countries, among other records related to national security and foreign policy, which Hur said implicated ""sensitive intelligence sources and methods."" Biden speaks during an event at Earth Rider Brewery in Superior, Wisconsin, US, on Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024. SPECIAL COUNSEL CALLS Biden 'SYMPATHETIC, WELL-MEANING, ELDERLY MAN WITH A POOR MEMORY,' BRINGS NO CHARGES But Biden also kept classified documents related to Ukraine and China. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., who is currently co-leading the impeachment inquiry against Biden, had asked Hur last year if any of the classified records Biden held were related to the countries that his family conducted business with. Comer is now demanding ""unfettered access to these documents to determine if Biden’s retention of sensitive materials were used to help the Biden’ influence peddling."" HunterBiden, joined the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings in June 2014. HunterBiden also had joint business ventures with Chinese energy firms. This image from Special Council Robert Hur’s investigation released by the Department of Justice on Thursday, February 8, 2024 shows Biden Delaware garage on December 21, 2022. COMER DEMANDS ANSWERS ON WHETHER Biden CLASSIFIED RECORDS MENTION COUNTRIES RELATED TO FAMILY BUSINESS DEALS With regard to the Ukraine documents, according to the special counsel report, Biden kept a September 2014 memo with the subject line ""U.S. Energy Assistance to Ukraine."" That memo was marked as confidential. Biden, at the time, did run U.S.-Ukraine policy. The report also states that the FBI located a green file folder Biden kept, labeled ""Ukraine 2/19/15."" That folder was inside an ""unlabeled green hanging folder."" Also, inside that folder was a red file folder labeled ""VP Personal."" Video In the ""VP Personal"" file folder was a telephone call sheet from Dec. 12, 2015, and talking points for a call with Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk. There is a handwritten note attached addressed to Biden executive assistant that states: ""Get copy of this conversation from Sit Rm for my Records please."" The note is signed ""Joe."" That document was marked as ""Secret."" Attached to that document was another, dated Dec. 11, 2015. The report describes that document as ""a transcript documenting the substance of a Dec. 11, 2015 call between Mr. Biden and Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk."" The document is marked ""CONFIDENTIAL"" and ""EYES ONLY DO NOT COPY."" NO CHARGES FOR Biden AFTER SPECIAL COUNSEL PROBE INTO IMPROPER HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS The special counsel’s report analyzes the documents, saying there ""is reasonable doubt that Mr. Biden willfully retained"" the documents. ""Mr. Biden's handwritten note does not request that executive assistant save the classified call sheet containing talking points for the call in his records; rather, he only requested the transcript of the phone call itself,"" the report states. ""And no jury could reasonably find that the substance of the call between Mr. Biden and the Ukrainian Prime Minister was national defense information."" This image from Special Council Robert Hur’s investigation released by the Department of Justice on Thursday, February 8, 2024 shows boxes inside Biden garage containing classified Afghanistan documents on December 21, 2022. The report states that Biden and the Ukrainian prime minister ""exchanged pleasantries and the Prime Minister heaped praise upon Mr. Biden for his December 9, 2015 speech to Ukraine's parliament."" ""They did not engage in a substantive policy discussion. There may be technical or nuanced reasons to maintain the classification of the call, but no reasonable jury could conclude the call or its contents were national defense information after the end of Obama administration, or that by asking for a transcript of the call Biden intended to retain national defense information,"" the report states. Biden, on Dec. 9, 2015, gave a speech in which he discussed corruption in Ukraine. ""And it’s not enough to set up a new anti-corruption bureau and establish a special prosecutor fighting corruption,"" Biden said in the speech. ""The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform."" Joe and son HunterBiden. In that speech, Biden also said Ukraine’s ""energy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by market principles — not sweetheart deals."" ""It’s not enough to push through laws to increase transparency with regard to official sources of income,"" he said. ""Senior elected officials have to remove all conflicts between their business interest and their government responsibilities.  Every other democracy in the world — that system pertains."" At the time, Burisma Holdings was under investigation by Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin. Several months later, in March 2016, Biden successfully pressured Ukraine to remove Shokin. At the time Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board receiving tens of thousands of dollars per month. Biden, at the time, threatened to withhold $1 billion of critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired. BIDENS ALLEGEDLY ‘COERCED' BURISMA CEO TO PAY THEM MILLIONS TO HELP GET UKRAINE PROSECUTOR FIRED: FBI FORM ""I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in,' I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,’"" Biden recalled telling then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Biden recollected the conversation during an event for the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018. ""Well, son of a b----, he got fired,"" Biden said during the event. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" Biden allies maintain the then-vice president pushed for Shokin's firing due to concerns the Ukrainian prosecutor went easy on corruption, and say that his firing, at the time, was the policy position of the U.S. and international community. House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky. But Comer blasted the discovery of this information as ""concerning"" and questioned the timeline. Meanwhile, with regard to China, Biden retained a memo with the subject, ""Engagement with China in the Second Term."" That document ""suggests activities Vice Biden could do in his second term to ""build on my work last year by engaging with China’s leaders in the second term.""  The document was marked as confidential. Comer’s investigation and the House impeachment inquiry is probing HunterBiden and James Biden Chinese business dealings, and whether Biden was involved or had knowledge of the ventures","['biden',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-paid-100k-through-joint-venture-chinese-energy-firm-ex-associate-testified,"We have ‘lots of questions’ for HunterBiden: Rep. James Comer Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., discusses HunterBiden’s upcoming appearance for his deposition on ‘Hannity.’ HunterBiden was paid $100,000 a month and James Biden was paid $65,000 a month in 2017 from their joint-venture with Chinese Communist Party-linked Chinese energy firm CEFC, a former associate testified to the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees. Mervyn Yan, who testified behind closed doors at the committees last month, said he did not know the nature of the work the Biden provided, according to a transcript of the testimony obtained by Fox News Digital. FORMER HUNTER Biden ASSOCIATE TONY BOBULINSKI TO TESTIFY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY Yan testified that he met HunterBiden and James Biden in May 2017 through a CEFC business partner Gongwen Dong, also known as ""Kevin."" Yan said that meeting lasted less than 15 minutes, but that it was the impetus for the joint-business venture, Hudson West III, with the Biden. HunterBiden and his attorneys Abbe Lowell, right, and Kevin Morris, left, unexpectedly attended a House Oversight and Accountability Committee markup on a resolution to hold the president's son in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena. Yan said the business venture was intended to facilitate the investment of Chinese energy infrastructure firms — like CEFC — into U.S. energy companies in exchange for energy exports to China. ""It was in May 2017, four of us. And then Kevin asked me to come to a meeting. And then eventually we met. I met HunterBiden and James Biden and Kevin, just four of us… in Midtown. That was a relatively quick meeting, roughly 15 minutes, because I noticed the time because I couldn’t even get a water in that place,"" Yan told the committees. DEMOCRATS BLAST IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AFTER GOP WITNESS SAYS HE WAS 'UNAWARE' OF JOE Biden'S ROLE IN FAMILY BIZ ""So basically we shake hands and basically say we can work together,"" Yan continued, adding that he would be ""sort of like on-the-ground person who executes and pretty much sources the infrastructure deals."" Yan said he would be ""working closely with Hunter."" Yan was asked what he thought HunterBiden ""brought to the table"" in the joint-venture. ""I don’t know,"" Yan testified. ""I don’t know what he can contribute."" Biden, left, and his younger brother, James Biden. Yan said he did not know if HunterBiden had ""knowledge"" in the energy infrastructure field. Yan said HunterBiden was given a $500,000 retainer, and then paid $100,000 per month. Yan also testified that HunterBiden had been working for CEFC prior to their introductory meeting, but did not know for how long. JOE Biden RECEIVED $40K IN 'LAUNDERED CHINA MONEY' FROM BROTHER IN 2017, COMER SAYS HunterBiden, though, in correspondence that was shown to Yan during his interview last month, initially requested $30 million for introductions in the industry. Fox News Digital last year reported correspondence between HunterBiden and Gongwen Dong, in which the first son demands $10 million to ""further the interest"" of the joint-venture, saying that the ""Biden are the best I know at doing exactly"" what the chairman of the CCP-linked firm wanted. ""The Biden's [sic] are the best I know at doing exactly what the Chairman wants from this partnership,"" HunterBiden writes in the WhatsApp message. ""Please let’s not quibble over peanuts."" According to a September 2020 report released by the Senate Homeland Security Committee and Senate Finance Committee on their investigation into HunterBiden’s foreign business dealings, Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong and other Chinese nationals that HunterBiden had business associations with were linked to the Chinese Communist government and the People's Liberation Army. That Senate report showed that on Aug. 8, 2017, just days after this WhatsApp message, CEFC wired nearly $5 million to the bank account for Hudson West III, a firm that HunterBiden opened with Chinese associates. ""These funds may have originated from a loan issued from the account of a company called Northern International Capital Holdings, a Hong Kong-based investment company identified at one time as a ‘substantial shareholder’ in CEFC International Limited along with Ye,"" the report stated. ""It is unclear whether HunterBiden was a half-owner of Hudson West III at the time."" The report also stated that ""the same day the $5 million was received, and continuing through Sept. 25, 2018, Hudson West III sent request payments to Owasco, HunterBiden’s firm."" The report stated the payments were described as consulting fees and reached ""$4,790,375.25 in just over a year."" Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., left, and HunterBiden. Meanwhile, Yan testified that none of the five infrastructure deals he worked on with the Biden in 2017 came to fruition, but said Hunter and James Biden were still compensated for their work in attempting to bring business. Yan testified as part of the House impeachment inquiry against Biden. Yan told congressional investigators that Biden was not involved in the joint-venture, and said neither HunterBiden nor James Biden ever suggested he would be involved. HUNTER DEMANDED $10M FROM CHINESE ENERGY FIRM BECAUSE 'BIDENS ARE THE BEST,' HAVE 'CONNECTIONS' Yan also testified that he was not aware of any funds from the joint-venture going to Biden. Yan maintained that he was never in contact with Biden, and that HunterBiden and James Biden did not discuss the then-former vice president in their conversations. Yan was pointedly asked if he was ever told that he could receive political favors from Biden if he engaged in business with HunterBiden, to which he replied in the negative. ""Did you engage in a business relationship with Hunter and James with the expectation that you would receive political favors from Biden?"" Yan was asked. Biden and his son, HunterBiden, step off Air Force One at Hancock Field Air National Guard Base in Syracuse, NewYork, on Feb. 4, 2023. ""No,"" Yan said. Next up is Tony Bobulinski on Tuesday. Then, James Biden will appear for a closed-door deposition on Feb. 21, and HunterBiden's deposition is set for Feb. 28","['‘lots', 'questions’', 'hunterbiden', 'rep', 'james', 'comer', 'rep', 'james',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tony-bobulinski-testify-behind-closed-doors-biden-impeachment-inquiry,"HunterBiden attorneys try to get gun indictment dismissed Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the first son's legal battles on 'The Story.' EXCLUSIVE: Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of HunterBiden, is expected to testify behind closed doors on Capitol Hill next week as part of the House impeachment inquiry against Biden, Fox News Digital has learned. A source familiar with the planning told Fox News Digital that Bobulinski will appear on Tuesday, Feb. 13 at 10 a.m. for his transcribed interview before both the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees. The source said his interview is expected to last eight hours. Bobulinski, who worked with HunterBiden to create the joint-venture SinoHawk Holdings with Chinese energy company CEFC, said he met with Biden in 2017. Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of HunterBiden, speaks to reporters at a hotel in Nashville, Tennessee on October 22, 2020. Bobulinski, in December, demanded Biden ""stop lying"" about that meeting and called on him to ""correct the record."" ""Why is Biden blatantly lying to the American people and the world by claiming that he did not meet with me face to face?"" Bobulinski told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""He should call his son Hunter and brother Jim as they can remind him of the facts. The American people deserve the truth!"" FLASHBACK: HUNTER Biden BUSINESS ASSOCIATE'S TEXT MESSAGES INDICATE MEETING WITH JOE Biden He added: ""I call on Mr. Biden to stop lying and correct the record."" Joe and son HunterBiden. Bobulinski said he is a ""former decorated Naval Officer who was willing to die for this great country and held the highest security clearance issued by the Department of Energy."" Bobulinski worked with HunterBiden to create the joint venture SinoHawk Holdings with Chinese energy company CEFC. Despite Biden recent denials of involvement with his son’s business dealings, text messages dating back to May 2017 reveal that Biden met with Bobulinski months after he left the vice president's office. Fox News Digital first reported on the text messages and that meeting in October 2020. ""Mrng plse let me knw if we will do early dinner w your Uncle & dad and where, also for document translation do you want it simple Chinese or traditional?"" Bobulinski texted HunterBiden on May 2, 2017. Text Message ""Not sure on dinner yet and whatever is the most common for a Chinese legal DOC,"" HunterBiden replied. ""Chinese legal docs can be both, i’ll make it traditional,"" Bobulinski said. Hunter replied: ""Dad not in now until 11- let’s me I and Jim meet at 10 at Beverly Hilton where he’s staying."" Text Message BOBULINSKI OFFERED TO TESTIFY AT HUNTER Biden GRAND JURY BUT 'NEVER HEARD BACK': SOURCE Later, Bobulinski sent a text to Jim Biden, Biden's brother, on the same day, May 2, 2017, saying: ""Great to meet u and spend some time together, please thank Joe for his time, was great to talk thx Tony b."" Text message The following day, May 3, 2017, Bobulinski sent another text to Jim Biden, saying: ""Morning, please let me know all set for things this mrng. I don't have credentials to get into Milken so just want to make sure not an issue to get me in, where should we meet this mrng?"" ""Milken"" was in reference to the 2017 Global Conference, which, in part, was held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, according to the program directory. Biden, on May 3, 2017, spoke at the conference, hosting ""A Conversation with the 47th Vice President of the United States Biden."" The meeting on May 2, 2017, would have taken place just 11 days before the now-infamous May 13, 2017, email, which included a discussion of ""remuneration packages"" for six people in a business deal with a Chinese energy firm. The email appeared to identify Biden as ""Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC,"" in a reference to now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co. HUNTER Biden INVESTIGATORS LIMITED QUESTIONS ABOUT 'DAD,' 'BIG GUY' DESPITE FBI, IRS OBJECTIONS: WHISTLEBLOWER The email includes a note that ""Hunter has some office expectations he will elaborate."" A proposed equity split references ""20"" for ""H"" and ""10 held by H for the big guy?"" with no further details. Bobulinski has repeatedly said ""the big guy"" was Biden. IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, who claimed that politics had influenced the yearslong federal investigation into HunterBiden, also said ""the big guy"" was known to be Biden. Biden and his son, HunterBiden, step off Air Force One, Saturday, Feb. 4, 2023, at Hancock Field Air National Guard Base in Syracuse, N.Y. The president, in December, was asked whether he had communicated with his son's business partners. The question came after Fox News Digital first reported that IRS whistleblowers turned over metadata to the House Ways & Means Committee revealing that he had used an email alias to communicate hundreds of times with HunterBiden and his business associate Eric Schwerin during his time as vice president. ""I did not, they’re lies. It’s a bunch of lies,"" Biden said Wednesday at the White House. His suggestion came after HunterBiden’s attorney Abbe Lowell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves, claiming that Bobulinski lied to the FBI during an interview Oct. 23, 2020, about his business dealings with the president’s son. James Biden is set to appear for his deposition on Capitol Hill on Feb. 21. HunterBiden is set to appear on Feb. 28.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-paul-says-ukraine-aid-package-would-tie-the-hands-of-future-administrations,"Senate breaks filibuster to advance $95B foreign aid bill Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the Senate's foreign aid package on 'Fox News Live.' Several conservatives agree with Sen. JD Vance's memo circulated early Monday that there's a ""hidden"" clause in the national security supplemental bill that he believes could be grounds to impeach former Trump from office if elected to office later this year. Vance sent a memo to GOP lawmakers highlighting that the bill, which would send billions of federal dollars to Ukraine, assures the delivery of funding through September 2025. Trump, however, has vowed to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of gaining office, which would also end funding. Vance's memo claimed that the supplemental bill ""represents an attempt by the foreign policy blob/deep state to stop Trump from pursuing his desired policy, and if he does so anyways, to provide grounds to impeach him and undermine his administration,"" and he urged Republican to block its passage. SEN. VANCE MEMO WARNS GOP COLLEAGUES OF ‘SYSTEMIC FAILURES’ IN US AID TO UKRAINE Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, warned his Republican colleagues that the proposed Ukraine aid bill could be used to impeach former Trump if he wins re-election in November. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, said he supported Vance's memo on Monday, arguing that Democrat are ""setting up"" for a possible Trump presidential win. ""They're locking in foreign aid that will even tie the hands of the next president,"" Paul told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""So, I think it's a terrible idea. But also, if the next President were to try to have a different policy, you can see the Democrat again starting an impeachment."" ""I think they're going to try to impeach him before he gains office now, and that's exactly what this is,"" he said. Sen. Rand Paul speaks during the COVID Federal Response Hearing on Capitol Hill on June 16, 2022, in Washington, DC. Mark Paoletta, former Office of Management and Budget General Counsel during the Trump Administration, told Fox News Digital in a statement that the clause in the bill text is an ""effort to inappropriately tie Trump’s hands in his next term by locking in Ukraine funding for multiple years."" ""In a presidential election year, Congress should not be making long-term funding commitments, particularly in foreign policy, that will attempt to tie the hands of the next commander in chief,"" Paoletta said. ""Trump had every right to pause the Ukraine funding for about 60 days, given his concerns about corruption in Ukraine and how best to spend those funds."" He added, ""As OMB General Counsel, I issued the legal justification to pause the funding, and would do it again today."" Russ Vought, a former Trump cabinet member, also agreed with Vance's memo and said in a post on X that Vance is ""absolutely right to interpret these Ukraine provisions"" in this manner. PENTAGON FINALLY RUNS OUT OF MONEY FOR UKRAINE, URGES 50 ALLIES TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING KYIV Biden meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Sept. 21, 2023, in Washington. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said the provision in the bill ""is gonna force him to send money and spend money for Ukraine."" ""This is in the bill,"" Tuberville told Fox News Digital. ""So, it's just another situation where the Democrat are doing something and working towards making sure that money's spent in a certain area where American taxpayers and this country don't have."" The Trump administration, through the OMB, withheld a total of about $400 million of security assistance from Ukraine in 2019. This came just before Trump asked Ukrainian President Voldomyr Zelenskyy to investigate the family of his 2020 rival, Biden, and while the White House allegedly was withholding an Oval Office visit from Zelenskyy in exchange for that investigation. These actions are what fueled the impeachment effort against Trump, in which he was ultimately acquitted. Trump has indicated that if he is elected president this year, he would resolve the war in Ukraine ""within 24 hours."" RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS WEIGH BILL TO SEIZE PROPERTY FROM THOSE WHO CRITICIZE PUTIN'S INVASION OF UKRAINE Sen. Rand Paul speaks during the COVID Federal Response Hearing on Capitol Hill on June 16, 2022, in Washington, DC. The supplemental package, on track for final passage this week in the upper chamber, would send billions of federal dollars to Ukraine , Israel and the Indo-Pacific. The bill text includes $1.6 billion to finance Ukraine's military as well as just under $14 billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, set to expire on Sept. 30, 2025. ""These are the exact same accounts Trump was impeached for pausing in December 2019,"" Vance wrote in a memo distributed to GOP offices early Monday. It's unclear if the bill would pass in the GOP-led House. A former version of this bill that included border-related provisions failed to pass in the Senate last week.

The surprise retirement of a GOP congressman in a solidly Republican Wisconsin congressional district has potential candidates weighing a run, even as a former state lawmaker quickly jumped into the race. U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher announced Saturday that he won’t run for a fifth term representing the 8th Congressional District in northeast Wisconsin. The abrupt move came just days after he angered his fellow Republican by refusing to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Just hours after Gallagher announced his retirement, former state Sen. Roger Roth, of Appleton, announced his candidacy Saturday and endorsed Trump at the same time, something he did not do in his 2022 run for lieutenant governor. GOP REP. MIKE GALLAGHER ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT FROM HOUSE: 'CONGRESS IS NO PLACE TO GROW OLD' The district Gallagher represents is firmly Republican. Seen as a rising star in the Republican Party, the 39-year-old Gallagher sometimes found himself at odds both with former Trump and his supporters, most recently over the Mayorkas vote. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., speaks during a hearing at the Capitol in Washington on July 18, 2023. Gallagher's surprise retirement in a solidly Republican Wisconsin congressional district has potential candidates weighing a run, even as a former state lawmaker quickly jumped into the race. Trump won the district by 16 points in 2020, even though he lost the state by less than a point to Biden. Gallagher won reelection three times by no fewer than 25 points. The district includes the cities of Appleton and Green Bay, Door County and covers mostly rural areas north through Marinette. Roth served in the Legislature from 2007 to 2023 and was the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor in 2022. He ran for Congress in 2010 but lost in the primary to eventual winner Reid Ribble. Roth, in a statement Saturday, pitched himself a ""proven conservative fighter"" while calling for strengthening the border, national security, the economy and ""our traditional values."" While Roth was the first candidate to get in, he almost certainly won't be the last. Trump ally and Republican consultant Alex Bruesewitz, who had said Gallagher ""betrayed the Republican Party and the American people with his vote to side with Mayorkas,"" is considering a run. He posted on X, formerly Twitter, a letter of support from the chair of the Oconto County Republican Party and said that he looked forward to ""spreading the MAGA message to the patriots in the Oconto GOP."" Bruesewitz immediately won the support of former Trump campaign consultant Roger Stone, who posted on social media that Bruesewitz ""would have the full support of the MAGA movement."" Bruesewitz, 26, was born in Wisconsin but currently lives in Florida. He would have to move back to Wisconsin to run for the seat. State Sen. Andre Jacque, of De Pere, also said he was considering running. Other current and former Republican members of the Legislature are expected to consider running. Democrat Kristin Lyerly, a De Pere doctor, previously said she was considering a run against Gallagher. Democrat fielded no candidate in the 2022 election. The Wisconsin Democrat Party said in a statement Saturday that it looked forward ""to competing in the 8th and bringing some stability and competence back to the House."" CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIR SLAMS TIKTOK'S ROLE IN AIDING CHINESE MIGRANT SURGE AT SOUTHERN BORDER Candidates have until June 1 to submit nomination papers for the Aug. 13 primary. The open seat will certainly fuel a competitive Republican primary , but the presidential race and not one for the congressional seat will drive turnout in November, said longtime conservative strategist Mark Graul who lives in the district. He didn't expect the race to greatly impact the presidential race. The race could be shaken up dramatically if the Wisconsin SupremeCourt agrees to hear a redistricting lawsuit challenging congressional boundary lines. said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin political science professor. The court has not said whether it will hear the challenge. The state elections commission said in a legislative redistricting case that any new lines must be set by March 15 in order for deadlines to be met for candidates running this November.","['biden',

Gimenez presses FBI chief on TikTok, artificial intelligence as national security threats Rep. Carlos Gimenez grilled FBI Director Chris Wray on AI and China during a hearing held by the House select committee on China. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called out the Biden-Harris campaign for joining TikTok on Super Bowl Sunday, after the administration signed legislation banning the app from most federal devices in 2022. ""Hey by the way, we just joined TikTok,"" the campaign's post on X read on Sunday, with the campaign's first TikTok video of the president answering quizzes about the Super Bowl. ""Biden campaign bragging about using a Chinese spy app even though Biden signed a law banning it on all federal devices,"" Hawley wrote on X in response to the campaign's post. Biden'S BRUTAL WEEK: PRESIDENT BATTERED BY GAFFES, DAMAGING SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT Biden 'DID NOT REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT,' WHEN HIS SON BEAU DIED, DURING SPECIAL COUNSEL INTERVIEWS Sen. Josh Hawley, right, called out the Biden-Harris campaign for joining TikTok on Super Bowl Sunday. The Biden administration set a 30-day deadline in late February 2023 for government agencies to purge the app , owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, from federal devices. Several Republican have urged Congress to ban the app in the U.S. entirely because of reports the app steals Americans' data and poses a national security threat. In 2017, China began enforcing a law mandating companies to provide the government with any personal data pertinent to the regime's national security. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has also called for a nationwide ban on TikTok, saying last month that the CEO is ""lying"" about the app being safe for users. FBI DIRECTOR CHRIS WRAY TESTIFIES CHINESE-OWNED TIKTOK HAS POWER TO ‘DRIVE NARRATIVES,' ‘DIVIDE AMERICANS’ The flag of China is flown behind a pair of surveillance cameras outside the Central Government Offices in Hong Kong on Tuesday, July 7, 2020. ""We should ban it,"" Hawley previously told Fox News' Sean Hannity. ""It tracks everything you do on your phone. It tracks everywhere you go, every text message you send, every email you write, and it's — all that information — all of it's available to the Chinese Communist Party. "" Cotton appeared to weigh in Monday on the Biden campaign joining TikTok, writing, ""Just like TikTok, Temu or any Chinese tech company must allow the Communist Party unfettered access to its data. This should be a non-starter for doing business in the United States."" Sen. Tom Cotton is pictured in the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, July 12, 2023. The app is vastly popular among young voter, and Biden's campaign team will be running the president's account. The campaign also has a presence on other social media platforms, including X, Instagram, Meta's Threads and former Trump's Truth Social. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government agency that reviews national security implications of foreign investments in the U.S. has been investigating TikTok since 2019. The Biden-Harris campaign said they will be posting content regularly on all platforms, including TikTok.

Biden said his administration is working on facilitating a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas that would bring a halt to the fighting in the Gaza Strip ""for at least six weeks,"" during his remarks Monday at the White House alongside King Abdullah II of Jordan. Biden met with the Jordanian monarch to discuss the ongoing war between Israel and the terror group as well as how to bring about a peace agreement between the Jewish state and Palestinian leaders. The two leaders met before addressing reporters at the White House Cross Hall with prepared remarks. ""The key elements of the deal are on the table. There are gaps that remain,"" said Biden.

NETANYAHU DECLARES ‘VICTORY IS WITHIN REACH’ AS HAMAS REDUCED TO ‘LAST REMAINING BASTION’ Biden speaks with Jordan's King Abdullah II in the Cross Hall of the White House on Monday.

He said the operation should not occur without a credible plan for ensuring the safety and support of more than one million Palestinians sheltering there who are ""exposed and vulnerable."" ""We cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah,"" the king said. ""It is certain to produce another humanitarian catastrophe."" On Monday, Israel said two Israeli hostages – Fernando Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70 – being held in Rafah were rescued. ""The hostages ... were held captive in harsh conditions. They were intentionally held in the middle of a civilian neighborhood inside a civilian building to try to prevent us from rescuing them. But we did,"" IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a video message. ""Fernando Marmon and Luis Har are now home in Israel. They have undergone medical examination and have been reunited with their families."" Biden noted that a Palestinian state could create conditions for Israel to have long-term peace with its Arab neighbors and long-lasting security. ""That effort was underway before the Oct. 7 attacks,"" Biden said. ""It's even more urgent today."" Jordan's King Abdullah II shakes hands with Biden in the Cross Hall of the White House on Monday.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-demand-transcript-bidens-interview-special-counsel-part-impeachment-inquiry,"Biden takes jab at special counsel report with joke about his memory Biden on Monday joked about his memory and age during a speech to the National Association of Counties in Washington, D.C. FIRST ON FOX: House Republican leading the impeachment inquiry against Biden are demanding the Justice Department turn over the transcript and any recordings of Biden interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur in his investigation into Biden's mishandling of classified documents. Hur, who released his report to the public last week after months of investigating, did not recommend criminal charges against Biden for mishandling and retaining classified documents and stated that he wouldn't bring charges against Biden even if he were not in the Oval Office. Biden RETAINED RECORDS RELATED TO UKRAINE, CHINA; COMER DEMANDS 'UNFETTERED ACCESS' AMID IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY Biden Those records included classified documents about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan and other countries, among other records related to national security and foreign policy, which Hur said implicated ""sensitive intelligence sources and methods."" Hur did not recommend any charges against the president but did describe him as a ""well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory"" — a description that has raised significant concerns for his 2024 reelection campaign. On Monday, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan and House Ways & Means Committee Chair Jason Smith penned a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland to request that he turn over the transcript and any recordings of Biden's October 2023 interview with Hur and the special counsel team. The three committee leaders are leading the impeachment inquiry against Biden. SPECIAL COUNSEL CALLS Biden 'SYMPATHETIC, WELL-MEANING, ELDERLY MAN WITH A POOR MEMORY,' BRINGS NO CHARGES Comer had asked Hur if any of the classified records that Biden held were related to the countries with which his family allegedly conducted business. The NewYork Times editorial board said Biden's press conference in response to Special Counsel Robert Hur's report made voter' trust in the president's mental strength worse. Comer told Fox News Digital last week that he wants ""unfettered access to these documents to determine if Biden’s retention of sensitive materials were used to help the Biden’ influence peddling."" The letter sent to Garland and obtained by Fox News Digital on Monday detailed the concerns that ""Biden may have retained sensitive documents related to specific countries involving his family’s foreign business dealings."" Rep. James Comer ""Further, we seek to understand whether the White House or Biden’s personal attorneys placed any limitations or scoping restrictions during the interview that would have precluded a line of inquiry regarding evidence directly linking the President to troublesome foreign payments,"" they wrote. COMER DEMANDS ANSWERS ON WHETHER Biden CLASSIFIED RECORDS MENTION COUNTRIES RELATED TO FAMILY BUSINESS DEALS ""Additionally, the Committee on the Judiciary requires these documents for its ongoing oversight of the Department’s commitment to impartial justice and its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Biden’s presumptive opponent, Donald J. Trump, in the November 2024 presidential election,"" they continued. Rep.

""Although Mr. Hur reasoned that Biden’s presentation ‘as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory’ who ‘did not remember when he was vice president’ or ‘when his son Beau died’ posed challenges to proving the President’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the report concluded that the Department’s principles of prosecution weighed against prosecution because the Department has not prosecuted ‘a former president or vice president for mishandling classified documents from his own administration.’"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., left, and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-asks-supreme-court-extend-delay-election-case-claiming-presidential-immunity,"Trump: If Biden won’t be charged, I shouldn’t be charged Fox News’ Madeleine Rivera reports on former Trump accusing the Justice Department of exercising a double standard. Former Trump is asking the SupremeCourt to extend the delay in the trial stemming from Special Counsel Jack Smith’s 2020 election interference case, arguing that he has presidential immunity to protect him from prosecution. Trump attorneys on Monday afternoon filed an emergency appeal with the SupremeCourt just days after a D.C. appeals court ruled the former president and 2024 GOP front-runner is not immune from prosecution in Smith's case. Trump NOT IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN 2020 ELECTION CASE, FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RULES The request is for temporary relief, to stay or block the appeals court mandate from taking effect, which would give the Trump legal team more time to file an appeal to the SupremeCourt on the merits of whether a former president deserves immunity from criminal prosecution for actions while in office. Former Trump speaks in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 9, 2024. The trial stemming from Smith's case against Trump is on hold pending resolution of the immunity question. The Justice Department may ask for expedited consideration of this initial emergency appeal. ""If the prosecution of a President is upheld, such prosecutions will recur and become increasingly common, ushering in destructive cycles of recrimination,"" the request states. ""Criminal prosecution, with its greater stigma and more severe penalties, imposes a far greater ‘personal vulnerability’ on the President than any civil penalty."" The request adds, ""The threat of future criminal prosecution by a politically opposed Administration will overshadow every future President’s official acts — especially the most politically controversial decisions."" The request states that the president's ""political opponents will seek to influence and control his or her decisions via effective extortion or blackmail with the threat, explicit or implicit, of indictment by a future, hostile Administration, for acts that do not warrant any such prosecution."" The U.S. SupremeCourt ""This threat will hang like a millstone around every future President’s neck, distorting Presidential decision-making, undermining the President’s independence, and clouding the President’s ability ‘to deal fearlessly and impartially with’ the duties of his office.'"" Trump's lawyers added, ""Without immunity from criminal prosecution, the Presidency as we know it will cease to exist."" Trump TRIAL DELAYED IN CASE STEMMING FROM SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S JAN. 6 INVESTIGATION A Trump spokesperson described the filing as a ""powerhouse filing."" Special Counsel Jack Smith ""As Trump’s powerhouse SupremeCourt filing explains, if immunity is not granted to a President, every future President who leaves office will face the prospect of being wrongfully indicted by the opposing party,"" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""Without complete immunity, the President of the United States will not be able to function properly. Even while the President is still in office, his political opponents will use the threat of future prosecution as a weapon, effectively blackmailing and extorting him to influence his most sensitive and important decisions."" The spokesperson added, ""The SupremeCourt should grant the requested stay and put an end to Deranged Jack Smith’s repeated attempts to corruptly short-circuit the ordinary and correct functioning of our justice system."" The filing comes after Washington, D.C., federal Judge Tanya Chutkan earlier this month officially delayed the trial, which was set to begin on March 4-- a day before the critical Super Tuesday primary contests, when Alabama, Alaska, American Samoa, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Vermont vote to select a GOP nominee. Smith charged the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights. Those charges stemmed from Smith’s investigation into whether Trump was involved in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, and any alleged interference in the 2020 election result.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was transferred to the critical care unit at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Sunday night after being transported to the hospital earlier in the day. Austin was transported to the hospital by his security detail on Sunday for symptoms suggesting an emergent bladder issue, according to a statement released by the Department of Defense from his doctors. Following a series of tests and evaluations, Austin was admitted into the critical care unit Sunday night for supportive care and close monitoring, the statement added. DEFENSE SEC. AUSTIN BACK IN HOSPITAL FOR BLADDER ISSUE, TRANSFERS POWERS TO HICKS: PENTAGON OFFICIALS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was transferred to the critical care unit at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Sunday night after being transported to the hospital earlier in the day. ""At this time, it is not clear how long Secretary Austin will remain hospitalized,"" the statement said. ""The current bladder issue is not expected to change his anticipated full recovery. His cancer prognosis remains excellent. Updates on the Secretary's condition will be provided as soon as possible."" Austin's powers have been temporarily transferred to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks as of Sunday afternoon. The defense secretary's planned trip to Brussels this week for meetings on Ukraine and NATO has been canceled, and the Wednesday Ukraine Defense Contact Group will meet virtually, the department said Monday. In December, Austin was admitted to Walter Reed and underwent prostate cancer surgery. He developed an infection a week later and was readmitted to the hospital. Hicks filled in at the time while she was on a previously scheduled leave. WHITE HOUSE ESTABLISHES GUIDELINES FOR CABINET NOTIFICATIONS FOLLOWING AUSTIN'S HOSPITALIZATION CONTROVERSY Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was admitted into the critical care unit Sunday night for supportive care and close monitoring. Biden , other senior administration officials and the American public were not told for days about his hospitalization or his cancer. Austin was admitted to Walter Reed on Jan.1, but the Pentagon failed to inform the public, press and Congress until Jan. 5. Officials also acknowledged that the White House had not been informed about Austin's hospitalization until Jan. 4. ""I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,"" Austin said during a press briefing on Feb. 1, regarding his hospitalization for prostate cancer treatment.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-expected-back-court-classified-documents-hearing-special-secure-florida-facility,"Trump legal charges could be significantly impacted by Biden classified docs case: John Ratcliffe Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe breaks down the Biden classified documents case, the Trump ballot ban case before the SupremeCourt and the rise in Chinese nationals crossing the southern border. Former Trump is reportedly expected to appear in person Monday for a hearing in the classified documents case against him to be held in a specially equipped secure room in Florida. Trump is to be present for the hearing presided over by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon that will be under seal and held in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility or SCIF, designed for viewing classified documents, in Fort Pierce, Florida, ABC News reported, citing court documents. However, Trump co-defendants, aide Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, are not expected to be in attendance because they do not have the necessary clearance to access classified information. A court filing detailing the schedule said that Cannon, of the Southern District of Florida, will hear arguments Monday from attorneys for Trump, Nauta and De Oliveira on ""defense theories of the case"" and how ""any classified information might be relevant or helpful to the defense,"" according to the outlet. Special Counsel Jack Smith will then present arguments to Cannon when Trump attorneys are no longer present. Cannon requested that both parties set aside Tuesday for further proceedings ""as necessary."" Trump and Smith’s legal teams have frequently disagreed during pretrial hearings over how much discovery should be redacted or entirely shielded from public view in court filings. Last week, Smith filed a motion urging Cannon to reconsider her prior ruling requiring that his team file a cache of documents on the public docket. Trump DEMANDS DOJ 'IMMEDIATELY' DROP CHARGES AGAINST HIM IN CLASSIFIED DOCS CASE AFTER Biden DECISION GOP 2024 presidential hopeful former Trump speaks at a ""Get Out the Vote"" Rally in Conway, SouthCarolina, on Feb. 10, 2024. Smith said in the motion last week that federal authorities were looking into a series of threats made online to a potential witness connected to the classified documents investigation and asked the judge to allow his team to file an exhibit under seal. ""The exhibit describes in some detail threats that have been made over social media to a prospective Government witness and the surrounding circumstances, and the fact that those threats are the subject of an ongoing federal investigation being handled by a United States Attorney's Office,"" the filing said. ""Disclosure of the details and circumstances of the threats risks disrupting the investigation."" Trump told Fox News Digital last week that Smith needs to ""immediately"" drop all charges against him in his classified records case following the decision not to bring charges against Biden for his retention of sensitive national security documents. Special Counsel Jack Smith arrives to give remarks on a recently unsealed indictment including four felony counts against former Trump on Aug. 1, 2023, in Washington, D.C. Trump was indicted on four felony counts for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Special Counsel Robert Hur's report was made public last week. Hur did not recommend criminal charges against Biden for mishandling and retaining classified documents and stated that he would not bring charges against Biden even if he were not in the Oval Office. WHITE HOUSE SLAMS HUR REPORT: 'GRATUITOUS AND INAPPROPRIATE CRITICISMS OF THE PRESIDENT' Those records included classified documents about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan, among other records related to national security and foreign policy, which Hur said implicated ""sensitive intelligence sources and methods."" The Hur report also sparked further concern over Biden age and mental faculties, as the special counsel noted serious discrepancies in the 81-year-old president's memory. Walt Nauta, personal aide to former Trump, arrives at the Alto Lee Adams Sr. US Courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida, on Aug. 10, 2023. Trump, on the other hand, was charged out of Smith's investigation related to his retention of classified materials. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 37 felony charges out of Smith's probe. The charges include willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and false statements. Trump, the 2024 GOP front-runner, was then charged with an additional three counts as part of a superseding indictment out of Smith’s investigation — an additional count of willful retention of national defense information and two additional obstruction counts. Trump pleaded not guilty. Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos De Oliveira arrives for a court appearance at the James Lawrence King Federal Justice Building, July 31, 2023, in Miami.

FIRST ON FOX - Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is unveiling his endorsement criteria for other political hopefuls he dubs ""The American Truth Pledge."" Speaking with Fox News Digital, Ramaswamy said he has received ""a flood of inbound requests for endorsements"" after he suspended his 2024 campaign last month and threw his support behind former Trump. But in order for them to earn his endorsement, they must share ""some basic ideals"" that were major themes of his presidential bid in putting ""America First."" ""I don't want to be making these decisions in a one-off manner,"" Ramaswamy said in an interview. ""I want to be making them in a systematic manner to say that if somebody gets endorsement, for me, it means that we are jointly endorsing some basic ideals that we stand behind."" RAMASWAMY SAYS DEMS MAY SWAP Biden WITH MICHELLE OBAMA FOLLOWING DAMNIMG SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT Former GOP hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy unveiled his ""American Truth Pledge"" endorsement criteria. The ""American Truth Pledge"" has four broad categories. The first reads ""The people we elect to run government should actually run the government,"" the second being ""The first and only moral duty of US leaders is to US citizens,"" the third being ""Public service is about serving the public, not oneself,"" and the final one reading ""The absence of national pride is an existential threat to our nation’s future — we must fill that void."" RAMASWAMY: ‘SINISTER FORCES AT PLAY' IF HALEY DOESN'T DROP OUT OF PRESIDENTIAL RACE: ‘THAT GETS UGLY’ Within the categories are bullet points of things Ramaswamy campaigned on like reducing the size of the federal government by 75% and backing a requirement for high school seniors to pass a civics test in order for them to vote. ""If people are on board with the planks of a lot of the vision of what I shared across my campaign for president, that's going to be the basis for the endorsements that I make,"" Ramaswamy said. Ramaswamy says those seeking his endorsement must share many of the ideals he campaigned on in the GOP primary. He continued, ""And so when I do endorse people in races across this country, large and small, that way people across this country can know what that means. It's not just that I have a pal or a friend who I think is a good guy or gal. It means that we stand for a shared set of ideals, by the way, which happened to be the ideals that this country was founded on in 1776."" RAMASWAMY PROPOSES DEBATE WITH HARRIS ON AI AS SPECULATION SWIRLS OVER Trump'S RUNNING MATE The biotech entrepreneur defied expectations when he first joined the race in February 2023 with virtually zero name recognition, outlasting big name Republican like SouthCarolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Vice President Mike Pence. US entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy endorses Republican presidential candidate former US Trump during a campaign event at the Atkinson Resort and Country Club in Atkinson, New Hampshire, on January 16, 2024.

Comey moment? An anonymous Biden official revealed some behind-the-scenes reaction to Special Counsel Robert Hur's report on the president's mishandling of classified materials. The special counsel determined that no charges should be brought against the president. But it also delivered devastating statements about the president's memory. ""It felt like a Comey moment for me,"" one Biden official reportedly told Politico, referring to the moment then-FBI Director James Comey released a letter, weeks before the 2016 election, stating that he would be investigating classified materials from Hillary Clinton that appeared to have been mishandled. Biden defended himself Thursday night in a raucous press conference , where he said his memory was ""fine."" A short time later, he referred to the president of Egypt as the president of Mexico. Biden held a press conference in response to Special Counsel Robert Hur's description of his age and memory. Even left-leaning and centrist media outlets blasted the strange press conference .

Feds decline to charge ‘elderly man with poor memory’ Special Counsel Robert Hur described Biden as a ""sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,"" and said he would bring no criminal charges against the president despite finding evidence he ""willfully"" retained and disclosed classified materials. Despite the lack of an indictment, plenty of people are calling the report highly damning of the president's mental state. Biden could not recall when his son Beau died, or the year he left the vice president's office, in interviews with the special counsel. Hur determined that charges weren't warranted, despite the potential that some documents could have ""risked serious damage to America's national security."" The special counsel ""also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""

Despite that, she suffered a landslide loss against another option on the ballot as about two thirds of Republican voter selected ""None of these candidates."" Nikki Haley hosts a rally in Conway as part of her swing in the Palmetto State leading up to the State's primary, in Conway SC, United States on January 28, 2024. Nevada's Tuesday primary had a Democrat and a Republican ballot, but the GOP isn't awarding any delegates from the election. Instead, Nevada Republican will hold its traditional caucuses on Thursday — where Haley will not be on the ballot. Haley's did not spend any measurable money or resources on campaigning in Nevada, but the symbolic loss was quickly used against her . A number of Trump's supporters took to X to rub salt in Haley's wound, including former 2020 Trump campaign official Marc Lotter, who wrote: ""Nikki Haley lost New Hampshire by 11% to Trump.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-bidens-anger-defensiveness-inflamed-anxiety-his-memory-issues,"Jen Psaki hits media coverage of Biden special counsel report: 'Banging your head against the wall' Former WH Press Secretary Jen Psaki hammered the media coverage of the Special Counsel report on Biden’s handling of classified documents on Sunday. Biden took a setback and turned it into a debacle. It’s not like it had never occurred to anyone that an 81-year-old president seeking a second term was problematic. There has been a growing debate about whether Biden has the mental acuity and physical stamina for the job. Even a majority of Democrat say in polls that he shouldn’t run again. I have been saying for a couple of years now, every chance I get, that it’s a mistake for the president’s advisers to shield him from the media. It makes him look disengaged. It takes him out of the news cycle. It leaves a void that is filled by Trump . It’s a surrender of the world’s biggest bully pulpit. The guy even turned down a Super Bowl interview for the second straight year, passing up a massive audience. MEDIA BUILDS UP AROUND TAYLOR SWIFT, SUPER BOWL LVIII AS Biden SEEKS SWIFT’S ENDORSEMENT What Biden inner circle is doing, of course, is protecting him from making gaffes. Instead, he puts out statements, which get little play. Even when the military launched retaliatory airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, the commander-in-chief remained silent. Biden sits in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Feb. 9, 2024, in Washington, D.C. My view is that making mistakes is a small price to pay for being on camera, providing video that drives television and the web. Biden may be working hard behind the scenes, but if voter don’t see you out there leading, they will wonder why you vanished – especially with your likely opponent constantly engaging with journalists. Taking a couple of questions from reporters and providing terse answers, often over the roar of a helicopter, just doesn’t cut it. Biden had a tough time on the memory front last week. He spent 30 painful seconds trying to think of ""Hamas"" until a reporter supplied the name. He mixed up Emmanuel Macron and the late Francois Mitterand. Then, telling the same anecdote, he described what German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had told him in 2021, except the leader died four years earlier. Then came the special counsel’s report. The good news – no indictment for mishandling classified documents – was immediately overshadowed by Robert Hur’s description of the president. The most stinging quote: ""a well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" So poor that no jury would convict him. INFIGHTING CONTINUES AT NEW YORK TIMES AS STAFFERS COMPLAIN ABOUT LGBTQ COVERAGE Biden, said Hur, couldn’t remember what years he had served as VP or the year that his son died. The president, Kamala Harris and the White House all said that Hur, originally a Trump appointee, had no business including such gratuitous insults. Attacking the prosecutor is a well-worn tactic, also practiced by the likes of Trump and Bill Clinton. No matter. A special counsel had given an official stamp of approval to public concerns and anxieties about the president’s mental fitness and his staff had no business letting the boss do five hours of interviews on the two days after Hamas massacred Israelis. But this is when Biden made things far, far worse. Privately cursing and furious, according to several media accounts, he decided to hold a rare news conference – the press was given a 20-minute warning – and poured kerosene on the fire. Biden sounded angry, petty and defensive – a ""crotchety grandpa,"" in the words of NewYork Times columnist Maureen Dowd. He expressed outrage: ""There's even a reference that I don't remember when my son died. How dare he raise that?"" Much of the mainstream media, along with many allies in the Democrat Party, had a come-to-Jesus moment last week, realizing Biden’s memory is a significant problem for the 81-year-old as he seeks re-election. And he turned his ire against the press, by turns combative and mocking. ""I'm well-meaning, and I'm an elderly man, and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been president. I put this country back on its feet,"" Biden said. As for his memory, ""take a look at what I've done since I became president. None of you thought I could pass any of the things I got passed. How'd that happen? You know, I guess I just forgot what was going on."" NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS SUGGEST Biden'S MEMORY COULD BE HUGE FACTOR IN FUTURE CRISIS CNN’s M.J. Lee uncorked a long and confrontational question before being cut off by the president: ""While many American people have been watching and they have expressed concerns about your age –"" ""That is your judgment,"" Biden snapped. ""That is your judgment. That is not the judgment of the press."" But it certainly showed up in poll after poll. ""They expressed concerns about your mental acuity,"" Lee said. ""They say that you are too old. Mr. President, in December you told me that you believe there are many other Democrat who could defeat Trump. So why does it have to be you now? What is your answer?"" Trump speaks on Feb. 9, 2024, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. ""Cause I'm the most qualified person in this country to be president of the United States and finish the job I started,"" he shot back. Oh, and he described Egyptian leader Abdel al-Sisi as the president of Mexico. It was a train wreck. His worst traits were on display. What might have been a two-day flap over the report turned into a chaotic melodrama, with reporters shouting to be recognized. This has the feeling of a turning point. Even though the 77-year-old Trump has had his missteps, confusing Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi, Biden seems more frail in the way he walks and talks, but it is too late for the Democrat to change horses now. The president has nine months to convince the country that he’s up to the job. They say Biden, having largely [shielded] away from interviews and press conferences, needs to be out in public far more. ""They want to see him engage with the press and voter in the off-script and punchy exchanges he’s been known for in the past, which they believe will help chip away at concerns about the president’s mental acuity. They say that it’s worth the risk of potential slip-ups that could reinforce the image that he’s declining."" Welcome aboard to everyone who thinks Biden should do more media. I wonder if he’ll take the advice.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-impeachment-courts-gridlock-reigns-washington,"DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says he won’t resign if impeached Republican were forced to shelve the priority after dissensions from a few GOP lawmakers. The government of the most powerful country on earth is no longer functioning . Every attempt to do just about anything goes down in flames. This happens periodically in a capital built on a divided government established by the founders. But when you meld that with the hyper-partisan atmosphere that is now embedded in our culture – set against a momentous presidential election – things seem more dysfunctional than ever. Biden KNEW THE BORDER BILL WAS ON LIFE SUPPORT AND WANTED TO BLAME Trump: HOWARD KURTZ Neither side trusts the other. The paramount concern is the blame game, making sure the opposition party takes a hit when things fall apart. At the same time, two major lawsuits, including one being heard by the SupremeCourt today , will shape the 2024 election in ways we’ve never had to contemplate before. The Trump team will try to convince the high court that Maine and Colorado acted illegally when they kicked the former president off the ballot. The appellate court ruling, which must be appealed to SCOTUS by Monday, says Trump can’t be shielded from prosecution by unlimited immunity, especially after leaving office. Republican presidential candidate former Trump speaks after meeting with members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at their headquarters in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2024. Who would ever have imagined that such battles would be fought for the first time in American history? Then again, we’ve never had an ex-president accused of criminal wrongdoing in four separate indictments–with the added twist that analysts agree the charges have boosted Trump campaign among the majority of Republican who view him as being unfairly persecuted. The long-running battle over the southern border is equally divisive. Now there’s no question that this is a major liability for Biden , who has failed for more than three years to prevent record-setting waves of illegal migrants from flooding into the country. Why he hasn’t done more, on a problem that even big-city Democrat mayors say is damaging, is hard to fathom. It is, after all, the signature issue that helped Trump get elected in 2016. WHAT BULLY PULPIT? WHY Biden STAYS OFF TELEVISION DURING BIG BREAKING NEWS So both parties, at least in the Senate, made an all-out attempt to hammer out a resolution. After four long months, they finally settled on compromise language involving asylum, parole and other thorny issues. Biden made more concessions than most thought he would–including the power to shut down the border if illegal crossings exceeded 5,000 a day. The Border Patrol union backed the measure, as did the Wall Street Journal editorial page. And more than just immigration was at stake. Foreign policy had to be baked into the cake. The president saw the measure as a tradeoff, with border security greasing the skids for long-stalled military aid to Israel and Ukraine. But Trump, the unquestioned leader of the party, said the bill would be a death knell for Republican and urged them to oppose it, to hold off until he took office. Trump invited them to ""blame me."" Biden said his likely opponent wanted the campaign issue more than a solution. Once the bill’s text was released, Republican started abandoning it in droves. There was little question that Trump was the motivating force. He is the party’s undisputed leader and on the verge of the nomination. JEFFERIES DEFEND SURPRISE APPEARANCE BY TEXAS DEMOCRAT IN FAILED MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT VOTE When Mitch McConnell, who strongly supports U.S. assistance to Ukraine, conceded the bill couldn’t pass, it was over. Ted Cruz called for McConnell to be ousted as minority leader. Speaker Mike Johnson , just a few months into the job, does not want aid to Ukraine, but brought to the floor a stand-alone measure to provide billions to Israel. That failed by a sizable margin. Now there’s chatter that Johnson could suffer the same fate as Kevin McCarthy. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., criticized the Senate's bipartisan $118 billion border security and foreign aid package after the text of the agreement was released. What’s more, Johnson revived an effort to impeach Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas – the first such attempt to oust a Cabinet officer in 150 years. The media and those on the Hill thought it would be a slam dunk. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But the maneuver failed by two vote, with three dissenting Republican saying it wasn’t fair to impeach Mayorkas for carrying out Biden policies. So even that exercise in scapegoating was botched. Not that he would have been convicted by the Democrat-controlled Senate. There’s a long way to go between now and November, both in Congress and the courts. But right now Washington is in a state of paralysis.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/tony-bobulinski-impeachment-investigation/index.html,"A former Biden family business associate levied critical but unproven allegations against Biden in a closed-door House interview Tuesday, resurrecting claims he has lobbed since 2020. Over the past several years, Tony Bobulinski has seemingly shared his story with anyone who would listen, including the Trump campaign. But his loftiest claims — that Biden was deeply involved in his son’s overseas business deals — are still uncorroborated and have been undercut by other key witnesses. “Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family’s business; he was an enabler, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability,” Bobulinski told House Oversight Committee investigators on Tuesday, according to a copy of his opening statement provided to CNN. He further said he believed the multi-million-dollar business deals secured by Biden son and brother only materialized “because Biden was in high office.” He said, “the Biden family business was Biden, period,” and specifically mentioned Biden alleged role in a lucrative proposed deal with a Chinese energy conglomerate. CNN has not independently verified the underlying evidence Bobulinski says supports his claims. Bobulinski went public in the final weeks of the 2020 race, only after unsuccessfully peddling his material to reporters, including at the conservative-leaning Wall Street Journal. When the newspaper covered Bobulinski’s public remarks, its story made clear that the China deal never closed, and that corporate records “show no role for Biden.” In his opening statement Tuesday, Bobulinski said he “personally met” with Biden in Los Angeles in May 2017 “multiple times to discuss the broad contours of our business dealings.” House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, praised Bobulinski’s testimony as well as criticized Democrat on the committee for how they participated in the interview. “We will soon release the transcript to provide the American people with transparency about Biden involvement in his family’s shady schemes and Democrat’ efforts to smear Mr. Bobulinski for blowing the whistle,” Comer said in a statement. While the interview was ongoing, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, slammed Bobulinski’s credibility, saying he was trying to spin two “encounters” with Biden into substantive business meetings. “He had two encounters with Biden in back-to-back days in May of 2017 that seemed extremely casual,” Raskin said. “They could not be described as meetings. And by his own account, they did not involve discussion of Biden and business. So, this is then a witness who I think can be charitably described as out of control.” “He offers absolutely no testimony that indicates any criminal activity by Biden. He offers no suggestion or evidence that Biden was involved in HunterBiden’s businesses,” Raskin added. Even after first going public in 2020, none of the federal stakeholders including the Justice Department, FBI or IRS have contacted him for his testimony, he said Tuesday. He approached the FBI in October 2020, and sat for an interview, but they never followed up, he said, and neither has the special counsel who is currently prosecuting HunterBiden. Another business associate involved with Bobulinski and the president’s son recently poured cold water on Bobulinski’s claims in a separate interview with committee investigators. The witness, Rob Walker, told House Republican in January he did not believe Bobulinski was a credible actor and would never consider working with him again. Walker framed Bobulinski’s allegations as “dumbfounded” and “nonsensical.” He speculated that Bobulinski’s motivations were “political.” “I think he had come to realize that Hunter had moved on without him and he was probably a little pissed also,” Walker added, “So that probably added a little fuel to Tony’s fire.” Walker recalled Bobulinski called him in October 2020 to discuss the possibility of HunterBiden’s laptop and did not disclose at the time the conversation was being recorded or that it would be shared with Fox News. In the recording, Walker was quoted saying, “You’re just going to bury all of us, man.” In his January interview with lawmakers, Walker elaborated that he was not worried about criminal liability, but rather was concerned that Bobulinski’s antics would make everyone involved look bad. “I thought it was ridiculous that he was going to be – he was going to say something and that made no sense and was stupid and was just going to embarrass everybody,” Walker said. Bobulinski’s claims also stand in stark contrast to a growing list of other Biden family business associates who have stated that Biden, as a private citizen and as vice president, was never involved in his any of his family’s foreign business dealings. Raskin had raised serious questions about Bobulinski’s credibility ahead of Tuesday’s interview. Republican quickly pounced on Bobulinski’s claims as they seek to implicate the president in his family’s foreign business dealings as part of their impeachment inquiry, and many have praised him going into Tuesday’s interview. But Democrat called out Republican for using Bobulinski’s allegations to paint the president as central to an elaborate criminal operation, while also questioning his ability to serve in light of special counsel Robert Hur’s final report , which painted a picture of a forgetful commander in chief. “Pick a side,” said Democrat Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas. “Either he is a criminal mastermind or he is old and feeble. Or it’s neither one of them.” Perhaps the most compelling piece of evidence ever offered by Bobulinski is an email from May 2017 that he exchanged with HunterBiden and some of their fellow business partners. In the message, they discuss an equity arrangement for a forthcoming deal involving Chinese energy interests. One of the emails suggests there might be “10 held by H for the big guy,” referring to a 10% equity stake held by HunterBiden for his father. House Republican have seized on this email, arguing that it proves their thesis that Biden was in business with his son, and that he made millions from China. But HunterBiden’s lawyers have countered that the proposed equity breakdown from the email was “never included in any agreement” and that the breakdown was actually proposed by Bobulinski, and never even garnered any response from HunterBiden. He was teed up for a highly anticipated interview with the GOP-run Senate Judiciary Committee, weeks before the 2020 election. But that was scrapped when he, instead, met with FBI investigators. Despite providing information to the FBI, federal prosecutors haven’t cited his materials in the sweeping tax indictment filed against HunterBiden. The Justice Department has accused HunterBiden of tax evasion and other financial crimes over many years. But prosecutors haven’t backed up the Republican’ claims about the Biden family’s supposed influence-peddling schemes. This story has been updated with additional developments.","['biden', 'family', 'business', 'associate', 'levied', 'critical', 'unproven', 'allegations', 'biden', 'closeddoor', 'house', 'interview',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/alejandro-mayorkas-impeachment-vote/index.html,"The House of Representatives, by an extremely narrow margin, voted Tuesday to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in almost 150 years. The result came one week after the stunning loss House Republican suffered when they last tried to impeach Mayorkas and GOP defections and an absence sank the initial floor vote, a move Republican had hoped to use to spotlight the Biden administration’s handling of the southern border. The impeachment comes as House Republican have faced building pressure from their base to hold Biden and his departments and agencies accountable over immigration and border security policies. House Republican claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

Tuesday’s vote was 214 to 213. Three Republican – Ken Buck of Colorado, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Tom McClintock of California – voted with Democrat against the measure. The Department of Homeland Security said that House Republican “will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution” following the vote to impeach. “House Republican will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution for political gain rather than working to solve the serious challenges at our border,” DHS spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said in a statement. “Secretary Mayorkas and the Department of Homeland Security will continue working every day to keep Americans safe,” the statement said. Last week, the absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republican the vote to approve the measure. Ken Buck, Tom McClintock, and Mike Gallagher are three House Republican who voted against impeaching Mayorkas. AP, Getty, Reuters The embarrassing initial defeat of the Mayorkas impeachment effort – which was quickly followed by another floor failure over a standalone Israel aid package – only crystalized the GOP’s yearlong struggle to govern amid a rambunctious and anemic majority . In the fallout of the failed impeachment vote, Republican lawmakers openly aired their frustrations and pointed fingers as to who is to blame, with some questioning their own leadership’s decision-making. “I had many people reach out to me via text message and say, ‘What the hell are you guys doing up there?’ I think our base is a little frustrated,” GOP Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas told CNN. “We may have the gavel, but we’re not acting like we’re in the majority.” “I was embarrassed for our conference, for our party, because we can do better than we did last night,” said GOP Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas. The meltdown – just the latest in a long string of chaotic moments under this GOP majority – is raising fresh concerns over how Republican will navigate the fast approaching government funding deadline and their ability to maintain control of the House after November. “It was a lousy day. Two bad play calls back to back. Both active choices to schedule them. It was a huge mistake,” said GOP Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, an ally to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. “The speaker is a very nice man,” he said of Speaker Mike Johnson, but added, “He’s gotta learn from his mistakes.” White House spokesman Ian Sams called the failed impeachment vote a “baseless, unconstitutional impeachment stunt” and said there is “bipartisan agreement” that it should fail. When presented with a bipartisan legislative solution negotiated with Senate Republican however, GOP House members flatly rejected it , which contributed to the ultimate squashing of the deal. Even with Mayorkas impeached in the House, it is highly unlikely that he will be charged in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office said in a statement, “The House impeachment managers will present the articles of impeachment to the Senate following the state work period. Senators will be sworn in as jurors in the trial the next day. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray will preside.” “This sham impeachment effort is another embarrassment for House Republican,” Schumer said in a statement. “The one and only reason for this impeachment is for Speaker Johnson to further appease Trump.” While Republican have been investigating Mayorkas’ handling of the border since they reclaimed the House majority, momentum to plot a swift impeachment of the secretary picked up steam last month as key swing-district Republican expressed fresh openness to the idea amid a recent surge of migrant crossings at the southern border . Mayorkas has sent a letter to House Republican to defend his record in public service in advance of the vote. “My reverence for law enforcement was instilled in me by my parents, who brought me to this country to escape the Communist takeover of Cuba and allow me the freedoms and opportunity that our democracy provides,” Mayorkas said. Mayorkas wrote that “the problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new” and called on Congress to help provide a legislative solution to the “historically divisive issue.” He praised the bipartisan group of senators he has worked with for its willingness to put their differences aside to try to find solutions at the border. Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee have repeatedly bashed their Republican colleagues for their efforts to impeach Mayorkas and have released a report calling the GOP effort “a sham.” Instead of formally launching an impeachment inquiry with a House floor vote, the GOP effort to impeach Mayorkas has been unilaterally run through the Homeland Security Committee as opposed to the House Judiciary Committee, where impeachment articles typically originate, though it is not constitutionally required. In the investigative phase, Homeland Security Committee Republican held 10 hearings, published five interim reports and conducted 11 transcribed interviews with current and former Border Patrol agents. But since launching the inquiry, the GOP-led panel has held only two hearings and has decided to move forward with impeachment articles without giving the secretary an opportunity to testify. Republican invited Mayorkas to testify at an impeachment hearing on January 18. But the DHS secretary said he was hosting Mexican Cabinet members to discuss border enforcement, and he asked to work with the committee on scheduling a different date, according to a letter obtained

It is unlikely Mayorkas will be charged in the Democrat-controlled Senate, and Senate Democrat are still weighing how to respond. Republican leadership alleges the agency leader committed “high crimes and misdemeanors ,” including “willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law” and allegedly making “false statements.” A previous impeachment attempt failed in the House last Tuesday . This is only the second time in US history a member of the president’s Cabinet has been impeached. The first time was in 1876 when Secretary of War William Belknap was impeached in the House but acquitted in the Senate. Here’s how each member of the House voted.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/steve-scalise-interview/index.html,"House Majority Leader Steve Scalise defended Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to hold last week’s failed vote on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, telling CNN in an interview the vote was a “tough judgement call” and that it may have helped lock in GOP lawmakers on the fence. “They felt it was important, there were some members that you know, might have been going back and forth, and to lock them in,” Scalise said ahead of a second vote to impeach Mayorkas scheduled for Tuesday evening . “I know these are all tough judgment calls, but to make sure that you lock everybody into who’s a ‘yes,’ and now we know we’re one vote short, and let’s go get that done,” Scalise added. Scalise missed last week’s impeachment vote – which failed in an embarrassing defeat, 214-216, with three House Republican voting against it – but he’s back in Washington on Tuesday and in “complete remission” following successful stem cell treatment for a form of blood cancer. So long as there are no more unforeseen absences, Scalise’s return will make him the decisive vote allowing Republican to impeach Mayorkas. The vote is occurring the same night that NewYork is holding a special election to replace expelled former Republican Rep. George Santos, giving Democrat the opportunity to make the GOP’s razor-thin majority in the House even tighter. While Republican won the district in 2022 with Santos, Scalise sought to downplay expectations, noting that Republican candidate Mazi Pilip is going up against former Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi in a congressional district that Biden carried in 2020. “The whole Democrat apparatus of the state of NewYork is supporting Suozzi in a Democrat-leaning seat,” Scalise said. “So, if we’re able to pull this off, it would be a real kind of shock-the-world moment and show that the Republican can win in tough places.” If Democrat win Tuesday night, Scalise would not say whether Republican would regret that Santos, who is facing federal charges, was kicked out of Congress. “At the end of the day, that happened, the House did its will, you can’t undo that. So, the real question is, can we still hold the seat?” Scalise asked. “Santos was a surprise when he flipped that seat. So you know, we’re going to be working hard to hold it. And the Democrat are surely pulling out every stop to try to get it as well.” Scalise backed Johnson’s vow not to take up the Senate’s $95.3 billion foreign aid bill that passed 70-29 early Tuesday morning . While GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell called on Johnson to hold a vote on the measure, which includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, the House speaker has said that the package must also include border security – even though House Republican swiftly rejected a border compromise struck by the Senate earlier this month. Scalise said that the Senate deal did not have any key policies from the Republican immigration bill that passed the House last year. “That bill is still sitting over in the Senate, but those policies have to be part of any kind of deal,” Scalise said. “We’ve been clear from the beginning that you’ve got to actually focus on securing America’s border, especially when you’re talking about Ukraine.” Scalise said that Johnson had requested a meeting with Biden on the border, but that the president had rejected it. “If the President really does want Ukraine funding, shouldn’t he be sitting down with the speaker now?” Scalise said. Scalise said that an immigration bill was “not just about getting, you know, a few people in a room together and saying let’s pass a bill that we can all agree on” – a reference to the Senate’s negotiations, which included Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma. Asked what message it would send to allies around the world not to pass an aid package to Ukraine, Scalise argued that the US has already provided billions. “We already passed billions of dollars in funding for Ukraine, so we clearly support their efforts to push back on the Russians’ aggression,” Scalise said. “The question is right now, can we also get an agreement on securing America’s border? And shouldn’t that be the front-and-center debate right now? Shouldn’t the president be engaged in that debate with the House Republican majority?” Scalise defended former Trump’s comments on NATO over the weekend – when the former president said that he once told a NATO country’s leader he’d encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” if the country didn’t pay their fair share in defense – saying that when he ran in 2016, Trump successfully prodded European countries to spend more on defense. NATO members are supposed to commit 2% of their GDP to defense spending, though many countries in the alliance do not meet that goal. “Trump was good in pointing out that if this is about America helping protect Europe, shouldn’t Europe be paying their fair share more than anybody?” Scalise asked. “So you’ve even seen countries like Poland that are approaching 2% because they recognize now how important this relationship is, and that you can’t just count on the US to fund the whole thing when the agreement was every country pays their fair share,” Scalise said. “That, I think, is what Trump continues to talk about. Biden hadn’t pushed those countries to pay their fair share.” Scalise declined to weigh in on a symbolic resolution from Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz and other Trump allies declaring that Trump never incited an insurrection or rebellion on January 6. Scalise said that he hadn’t read the resolution – another example of Trump allies seeking to rewrite the narrative about January 6 – and that it would go through the committee process. The House majority leader was critical of the legal cases against Trump blending into the presidential election, saying there shouldn’t be efforts to kick Trump off the ballot or trials right before Election Day. Asked about the GOP impeachment inquiry into Biden, Scalise said that process was continuing. “We have a process that’s playing out with Biden, it’s an impeachment inquiry that we’re in the middle of right now,” Scalise said, noting Republican continued to collect testimony this week. Scalise said that the stem cell treatment he received for his blood cancer forced him to isolate for six weeks while his immune system recovered, but he’s happy to be back in Washington. “I feel great,” Scalise said. “Being out for six weeks was tough, but it’s really good to be back.” This story has been updated with additional developments.","['house', 'majority', 'leader', 'steve',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/trump-hush-money-hearing-will-attend/index.html,"Trump is expected to attend Thursday’s hearing in the NewYork hush money criminal case, according to Steve Sadow, Trump lead attorney for the Georgia election subversion case. Trump had considered traveling to Georgia on Thursday for a hearing in the criminal case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis but is now planning to attend the hearing in NewYork, multiple sources familiar with the matter said. His expected court appearance comes just before the former president could face another consequential legal decision – this time on the fate of his business empire in NewYork. Both hearings are scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. ET. Fulton County DA Fani Willis appears for a hearing on November 21, 2023. Dennis Byron/Pool/Getty Images Related article Fulton County DA could be disqualified from Trump case if she financially benefitted from relationship with top prosecutor Initially, Trump was intrigued by the idea of traveling to Georgia if Willis was forced to take the stand and answer questions under oath about allegations she engaged in an improper romantic relationship with her top deputy, Nathan Wade, one of the sources told CNN. A judge on Monday did not rule out the possibility that Willis will have to testify but made clear that is contingent on what other witnesses say first. Trump advisers made the case that the NewYork hearing is more important as it is a criminal case that directly impacts him, according to a source familiar with internal discussions. Trump was charged last March with falsifying business records to commit or conceal another crime. Prosecutors allege that the former president engaged in a cover up scheme to hide reimbursement payments made to his former attorney, Michael Cohen who had paid hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public about a past affair with Trump before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges and denied the affair. The hearing in Fulton County is largely viewed by those advisers as procedural despite the possibility of Willis taking the stand and facing disqualification. As always, senior advisers warned that Trump could still change his mind last minute and decide to attend the hearing in Georgia, however that is not currently the plan. Trump civil fraud trial decision expected Friday Trump, barring unforeseen circumstances, will also learn on Friday how much the judge overseeing the civil fraud case in NewYork is ordering him and his real estate business to pay for fraudulently inflating financial statements for a decade, a person familiar with knowledge of the decision said. Judge Arthur Engoron initially said he hoped to issue the ruling at the end of January, following a three-month trial. Since then, the monitor overseeing the Trump Organization issued a report, and the judge inquired about news articles of a possible perjury plea deal by former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. It appears any delays caused by those two events have now been resolved. The NewYork attorney general’s office sued Trump alleging he engaged in a decadelong fraud by inflating the value of properties to obtain better rates on loans and insurance. They also allege Trump and others violated numerous other NewYork laws related to the issuance of false financial statements. The state is seeking more than $370 million and to ban Trump from doing business in NewYork state . They are also seeking to ban his two adult sons from running a business in the state for five years. Trump and his adult sons have denied any wrongdoing and said no one was harmed by the alleged fraud.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/lloyd-austin-hospital/index.html,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was released from the hospital Tuesday afternoon after being treated for a bladder issue and is expected to return to the Pentagon “later this week,” the Defense Department said. He resumed his full duties from home at 5 p.m., approximately 48 hours after he had first transferred his responsibilities to his deputy, Kathleen Hicks. Austin will “recuperate and perform his duties remotely from home for a period before returning to work at the Pentagon later this week,” the Pentagon said in a statement. Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said earlier Tuesday that Austin was “in good condition” and that the Pentagon anticipated he would be released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center later in the day. The bladder issue that hospitalized Austin on Sunday was not related to the prostate cancer diagnosis he received in Decembe﻿r, Singh said. Doctors at Walter Reed said it was related to the surgery to treat the cancer. Complications from the procedure first sent Austin to the hospital on New Year’s Day, where he stayed for two weeks. The cause of the recent bladder issue was identified and was treated with a non-surgical procedure on Monday, doctors said. The secretary, Singh said, still anticipates participating in and providing opening remarks at the virtual Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday. Austin’s recent hospitalization came just weeks after he was admitted in January following complications from a procedure to treat his prostate cancer. He was intensely criticized for a dayslong delay in notifying the White House of that hospitalization, for which he has said he takes full responsibility. “I want to be crystal clear: We did not handle this right. And I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility,” Austin said at a news conference this month. “I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.” An administration official told CNN on Tuesday that Biden and Austin spoke by phone on Tuesday, and the president wished “him well in his recovery.” A statement from Austin’s doctors on Monday said Austin underwent “non-surgical procedures under general anesthesia to address his bladder issue.” They added that they believed he would make a “successful recovery.” They have also said Austin is “expected to make a full recovery” from his cancer diagnosis","['defense', 'secretary', 'lloyd', 'austin', 'released', 'hospital', 'tuesday', 'afternoon', 'treated', 'bladder', 'issue', 'expected', 'return', 'pentagon', '“later', 'week”', 'defense', 'department', 'resumed', 'full', 'duties', 'home', '5', 'pm', 'approximately', '48', 'hours', 'first', 'transferred', 'responsibilities', 'deputy', 'kathleen', 'hicks', 'austin', '“recuperate', 'perform', 'duties', 'remotely', 'home', 'period', 'returning', 'work', 'pentagon', 'later', 'week”', 'pentagon', 'statement', 'deputy', 'pentagon', 'press', 'secretary', 'sabrina', 'singh', 'earlier', 'tuesday', 'austin', '“in', 'good', 'condition”', 'pentagon', 'anticipated', 'released', 'walter', 'reed', 'national', 'military', 'medical', 'center', 'later', 'day', 'bladder', 'issue', 'hospitalized', 'austin', 'sunday', 'related', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'received', 'decembe\ufeffr', 'singh', 'doctors', 'walter', 'reed', 'related', 'surgery', 'treat', 'cancer', 'complications', 'procedure', 'first', 'sent', 'austin', 'hospital', 'new', 'year’s', 'day', 'stayed', 'two', 'weeks', 'cause', 'recent', 'bladder', 'issue', 'identified', 'treated', 'nonsurgical', 'procedure', 'monday', 'doctors', 'secretary', 'singh', 'still', 'anticipates', 'participating', 'providing', 'opening', 'remarks', 'virtual', 'ukraine', 'defense', 'contact', 'group', 'wednesday', 'austin’s', 'recent', 'hospitalization', 'came', 'weeks', 'admitted', 'january', 'following', 'complications', 'procedure', 'treat', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'intensely', 'criticized', 'dayslong', 'delay', 'notifying', 'white', 'house', 'hospitalization', 'takes', 'full', 'responsibility', 'want', 'crystal', 'clear', 'handle', 'right', 'handle', 'right', 'president', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'team', 'american', 'public', 'take', 'full', 'responsibility”', 'austin', 'conference', 'month', 'apologize', 'teammates', 'american', 'people”', 'administration', 'official', 'tuesday', 'biden', 'austin', 'spoke', 'phone', 'tuesday', 'president', 'wished', '“him', 'well', 'recovery”', 'statement', 'austin’s', 'doctors', 'monday', 'austin', 'underwent', '“nonsurgical', 'procedures', 'general', 'anesthesia', 'address', 'bladder', 'issue”', 'added', 'believed', 'make', '“successful', 'recovery”', 'austin', '“expected', 'make', 'full', 'recovery”', 'cancer', 'diagnosis']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/new-york-special-election-what-to-watch/index.html,"The special election to replace former Rep. George Santos in NewYork’s 3rd Congressional District, an emerging battleground that could serve as a bellwether for other suburbs this fall, appears to be headed for a neck-and-neck finish after two months of campaigning bolstered by millions in outside spending. The district, which encompasses Nassau County on Long Island and northeast Queens, is largely well-educated and affluent – the kind of place Democrat now expect to win – but because of its ideological diversity, a recent trend toward the GOP and a deeply rooted county Republican Party machine, it has become a true Election Day wild card. Rep. Tom Suozzi, Democrat candidate for NewYork's 3rd Congressional District, and Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., left, conduct the ""Women For Suozzi Rally,"" in Port Washington, NewYork, on Saturday, February 3. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/AP Related article NewYork Democrat are worried about Tuesday’s special election. They have good reason to be Tuesday’s outcome could provide lessons for both parties as the general election season nears and both the presidential contest and the race for control of the House are expected to turn, in large part, on the views of suburban voter. In the near term, victory for Democrat Tom Suozzi, who previously represented the district in Congress after running Nassau County for most of the 2000s, would provide a lift for Biden – who won the district by 8 points in 2020 – and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, who will likely need the seat if he’s to become speaker next year. Victory for Republican Mazi Pilip, a largely unknown county legislator from Great Neck, would signal the potential for more GOP gains across the country – and provide some comfort to a slate of freshmen GOP House members from NewYork who will be defending their seats in November. Suozzi’s election as Nassau County executive in 2001 broke Republican’ 30-year lock on the position. After losing his bid for a third term in 2009, then falling in Democrat primaries for statewide office, Suozzi was elected to the US House in 2016. He was reelected two more times before leaving the seat for another unsuccessful campaign for governor. But his brand remains strong on Long Island, which led the party to handpick him as the nominee after the special election was called. Pilip is lesser known in the district but has the powerful county party – which also controls most local offices in Nassau – driving her campaign, which, if successful, would provide the clearest proof yet that Republican are once again the political kings of Long Island. She would also be the first Black Republican to represent NewYork in Congress. Here’s what to watch for: The three I’s and abortion Immigration, inflation, Israel and the SupremeCourt’s overturning of Roe v. Wade framed the political landscape on Long Island while Santos served his final days in office last year. A couple of months on, they remain – along with the cost of housing – the big issues facing the candidates. Immigration, though, has become – if not the most important – then the most talked about issue in the campaign. Pilip has repeatedly hammered Suozzi over a past clash with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and sought to direct anger over the migrant crisis in nearby NewYork City his way. In their only debate last week, Pilip said Suozzi “voted to open the borders” and, along with Biden, “created the migrant crisis” during his time in Congress. Though that might seem like a bit of a stretch given Suozzi’s position, frustration with border policy is a potent political tool – especially on Long Island, where voter largely get their news from city outlets and view the city’s problems as previews of their own. Inflation remains an important topic, but less so than perhaps a year or so ago when prices were soaring. Israel has been a point of discussion, if not debate. Suozzi is a staunch supporter, as is Pilip, who emigrated there and served in the Israel Defense Forces before coming to the US. Abortion, though, could yet again emerge as an X-factor. Suozzi supports abortion rights and wants to codify Roe v. Wade. Pilip is more difficult to pin down. She calls herself “pro-life” but has said, “When it comes to abortion, every woman should have the choice to make that decision” and that she would not vote for a federal ban. During the debate, Suozzi pressed her repeatedly to stake out a clearer position. After a long back-and-forth, though, the question remained unsettled. The Suozzi brand vs. the GOP machine Suozzi has deep roots in the district. He is a moderate – campaigning, governing and legislating as one. If there had been a primary for the nomination, he probably would have attracted a more liberal challenger. So Pilip’s and GOP allies’ attacks suggesting he’s a “ Squad ” wannabe didn’t land with too many voter here. But there is another brand to consider: the Democrat. The party has lost races at almost every level on Long Island beginning in 2021, and Republican are following a similar playbook this year, hammering Suozzi over NewYork City’s migrant crisis , along with rising cost-of-living and housing concerns. Neither candidate is advertising their party affiliation on the thousands of lawn signs across the county, and both have steered clear of national party leaders, at least publicly. However, the singular question entering Election Day is whether Suozzi’s generally positive reputation is enough to overcome a powerful GOP machine that is primed to drive – perhaps literally, in some cases – its supporters to the polls. The weather! Early voting numbers showed registered Democrat turning out at a higher clip, but operatives in both parties aren’t investing much in the information. Democrat tend to vote early; Republican usually prefer casting their ballots on Election Day. The twist Tuesday is that the NewYork City metropolitan area saw a surge of snow early morning from a strong and fast-moving nor’easter . Long Island is relatively condensed – in comparison with a place like Iowa, at least – but the snow and sleet could potentially disadvantage Republican. Congressional Leadership Fund, a leading House GOP super PAC, hired multiple snow plows to help with get-out-the-vote efforts Tuesday, the group said. Speaking outside a polling place in Massapequa on Tuesday, Pilip said her campaign and allies would provide rides for people who want to get to the polls. “This is a day we have been working very hard for the last eight weeks,” she said. Suozzi also said his campaign was also offering rides to the polls, with about 30 people out as drivers. “The weather’s falling on the Democrat and Republican. Nice and bipartisan – just the way I like things,” he said while campaigning in Uniondale. Remember George Santos? The shunned charlatan has been mostly out of sight and mind since being expelled from Congress last year over assorted personal lies, misconduct and alleged crimes. And for all the hoopla surrounding his brief stint as the district’s nominal “representative,” the specter of Santos is not expected to play a big role in the outcome. That’s in part because Suozzi has mostly ignored the sage, figuring that’s not what will influence the swing voter he needs to win back his old seat. Democrat operatives also believe that any Santos bounce was baked into the campaign a long time ago – with previously unengaged Democrat voter angry over his deceptions and primed now to vote and, in many cases, volunteer for Suozzi. Pilip has obviously not spent too much time talking about Santos, but Republican are banking on an idea that, as the county becomes increasingly Trump-pilled, conservatives might turn out if for no other reason than to stick it to the Democrat, who, in this telling, drove the duly elected Republican out of office. Note: Almost all local GOP officials and officeholders called for Santos to resign, and the vote to expel him from Congress was a rare bipartisan success.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/rfk-jr-democrats-trump-attacks/index.html,"The Democrat Party has ramped up its attacks on independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in recent days, marking the first significant attempt by either party to shape voter sentiment around his candidacy ahead of a potential rematch of the 2020 election. The Democrat National Committee has taken multiple steps in recent days to portray Kennedy as a spoiler who would help Republican frontrunner Trump defeat Biden , arguing Kennedy is funded primarily by wealthy donors aligned with the former president. Last week, the DNC filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Kennedy’s campaign had illegally coordinated with American Values 2024, a PAC backing his White House bid. Kennedy’s campaign has denied coordinating with the group. In a call with reporters outlining the complaint, DNC adviser Ramsey Reid blamed Trump and his donors for turning Kennedy into a “stalking horse” by funding the PAC. “We’re concerned that Trump is disrespecting the Democrat process. It’s pretty clear that Trump and his megadonors are propping up RFK Jr. as a stalking horse,” Reid said. Robert F.

Mellon gave approximately $15 million to American Values 2024 last year. In 2020, he gave $20 million to America First Action Inc., one of the leading outside groups backing Trump reelection. On Saturday, as Kennedy held a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the DNC advertised on four billboards around the area accusing Kennedy of being “powered by MAGA/Trump.” And after the Kennedy-aligned PAC released a new TV ad during the Super Bowl that repurposed an old spot from the 1960 campaign of President John F. Kennedy, the candidate’s uncle, the DNC issued a statement highlighting the PAC’s funding from Mellon. “It’s fitting that the first national ad promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s candidacy was bought and paid for by Trump largest donor this cycle,” DNC rapid response director Alex Floyd said in a statement released shortly after the ad aired Sunday. Kennedy’s team pushed back on the Democrat attacks, saying that donors “from across the political spectrum are supporting the Kennedy campaign as they are tired of the corruption in the two-party system.” “Instead, donors want an independent candidate who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, end the forever wars, unravel corporate capture, and the end chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN. DNC adviser Lis Smith told CNN the party’s latest efforts are meant to educate voter on the connections between Trump and Kennedy, while acknowledging the critical role Kennedy could play in the general election. “It’s clear that Trump and his allies view him as a useful stalking horse who could help throw the election to Trump in November,” Smith said. While his independent campaign faces steep odds of success, Kennedy’s candidacy could influence the outcome of a Biden-Trump rematch if he garners enough support in critical states. In the 2020 election, Biden flipped three states – Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin – by margins of less than 1%. Recent national polling of a Trump-Biden rematch suggests the race could be narrowly decided again. A CNN/SSRS poll released earlier this month showed Trump with 49% support among registered voter, compared with 45% for Biden. It’s unclear as of now how Kennedy would affect a potential general election between Biden and Trump – whether he’d draw more support from historically Republican or Democrat voter, or whether he’d receive enough total support to influence the election either way. An NBC News poll released this month found 34% of registered voter saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy. But Kennedy’s allies have targeted Biden and Democrat as they look to gain traction in the race, a sign they’re ready to meet the DNC’s escalating attacks straight ahead. In a statement released after the Super Bowl ad, American Values 2024 co-founder Mark Gorton criticized the DNC for its efforts targeting Kennedy. “The only argument the DNC has left is that Biden is not Trump. When RFK Jr. gets on the ballot, the American public will have the ability to choose a candidate who is not Trump, who has integrity, bravery, a proven track record of fighting corporate corruption, and the ability to stand up to the corporate interests that have taken over the Biden administration. The American people are waking up, and the DNC’s only hope is to prevent them from having a choice,” Gorton said.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/congress-trump-nato-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — Lawmakers from both parties last December may have been anticipating former Trump’s current NATO trash talk when they quietly slipped language limiting a president’s power to pull the US out the alliance into the annual defense policy bill , which passed with bipartisan support. Trump boasted at a weekend campaign rally that as president he told an unidentified NATO leader that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” with member countries who are in arrears on defense spending. The whole point of NATO is supposed to be that members act to defend each other if attacked. Biden seized on Trump recent NATO bashing, suggesting in Tuesday remarks from the White House that Trump was the first president who “bowed down” to a Russian dictator, which Biden said was “dumb,” “shameful,” “dangerous” and “un-American.” Add that criticism to a chorus of alarm from NATO and European officials after Trump comments and in the midst of House Republican’ blockage of additional aid for Ukraine. Trump desire to pull out of NATO The post-World War II alliance of Western democracies was built around NATO, but Trump has long complained that the US is getting a raw deal with the organization, paying too much and getting too little. Trump ultimate goal, writes CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen , has long been to pull the US out of NATO, which was formed in 1949 to contain the threat of the Soviet Union and the spread of communism and is now organized around deterring Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN’s Jim Sciutto, in a forthcoming book , quotes a former official in both the Trump and Biden administrations who predicts a Trump election win in November would mean “the US will be out of NATO.” Sciutto also writes about how Trump nearly pulled the US from the alliance during a 2018 NATO meeting. At the same time, Trump tried to claim credit, arguing it is his tough talk and not the threat of Russian invasion that has caused NATO member countries to increase their defense budgets in recent years. What’s to stop him? If Trump wins the 2024 election and does turn on NATO, he would run into that new language from Congress, which says the president “shall not suspend, terminate, denounce, or withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty” without either a supermajority vote in the Senate or an act passed by the full Congress. When I asked the former US Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker about what Trump could do to undermine NATO as president, he first pointed out that Trump was boasting about his interaction with an unnamed world leader rather than promising future action. Kurt Volker testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on November 19, 2019, in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The Constitution, Volker noted, says the Senate must be involved with ratifying treaties but it is silent on the subject of withdrawing from a treaty. Any court battle could take years. Alternatives to withdrawal Rather than attempting to withdraw from NATO, a second Trump presidency could allow his allies to pursue a policy of making NATO “ dormant ,” an idea pushed by at least one Trump-allied think tank. Nobody knows exactly what that would look like, Volker said, but the president has immense power over how the US interacts with its allies. “There’s lots of things that you can do administratively as the commander in chief that would still be very disruptive for NATO,” Volker said. A president could reduce the number of exercises Americans take part in with NATO allies, further reduce troop presence in Europe, withhold payments to the NATO infrastructure or cut down on the US military budget. The US would still be bound, under this type of scenario, by the pledge to defend other NATO nations, but it would not be prepared. “It’s not just enough to say, yes, we will fight together,” said Volker. “You actually have to have the capabilities.” Americans lead NATO by design If Trump wins the election this year and then seeks as president to reduce American military participation, he could, in theory, recall the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower first held the job after NATO’s founding, and ever since, the top NATO commander has always been an American admiral or general. NATO’s power to deter attacks on other countries rests in large part on American nuclear weapons, and so it is appropriate that an American service member sits atop the NATO structure, according to Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. This December 1957 photo shows heads of government, including US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, attending the annual ""family portrait"" during NATO top-level meetings at the Palais de Chaillot. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Pulling American generals out of NATO might force other NATO countries to seek their own nuclear deterrents. Part of the reason Europeans have not pursued a collective European military is by American design and a result of security provided by NATO, Bergmann said. Countries are eager to be protected by Article 5 of NATO’s charter, which is the principle that an attack on one member is an attack on all of the members. Sweden and Finland have both worked hard to join after Russia invaded non-member Ukraine. Finland joined in 2023, and Sweden is inching closer to accession . That provision that Trump dislikes has only been invoked one time, after 9/11, when the US and NATO allies invaded Afghanistan after terror attacks brought down the World Trade Center and struck the Pentagon. More members hit 2% benchmark Trump frequently complains that NATO members other than the US don’t pay dues, which is a misstatement of facts . Members are supposed to spend a minimum of 2% of their GDP on defense, but it is just a guideline that doesn’t require payments to NATO or the US. Multiple NATO countries do not hit that benchmark, although spending has risen since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “That argument is weaker and weaker, because allies are indeed spending more and doing more,” Volker said. NATO’s charter is a relatively short and simple document. Its section on how a country withdraws from the alliance is further evidence of how central the US is to the organization: A country wishing to withdraw must notify the US a year before it plans to withdraw. No country, by the way, has ever withdrawn from NATO, although France did not take part in NATO’s military operations from the mid-1960s until 2009. A difficult relationship to unbreak If Trump is reelected and chooses to hollow out NATO or make US participation dormant, it would sever ties that future presidents might have trouble repairing. “It’s just like any relationship,” said Bergmann of the likelihood of permanent damage if Trump were to materially alter the NATO alliance. “This would be seen as the US basically having a massive affair and like cheating on Europe. Could the marriage be restored? Well, potentially. But it would require, I think, a lot of effort on the part of future administrations.” Marco Rubio is not worried Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was a sponsor of the new law meant to prohibit a president from leaving NATO. Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, he dismissed the threat posed by Trump. “He’s telling a story,” Rubio said, adding, “He doesn’t talk like a traditional politician, and we’ve already been through this. You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.” “I have zero concern, because he’s been president before. I know exactly what he has done and will do with the NATO alliance,” Rubio said, although he added, “But there has to be an alliance.”","['version', 'appeared', 'cnn’s', 'matters', 'newsletter',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/new-york-special-election-biden-trump/index.html,"Democrat, when confronted with Biden ’s poor polling numbers, often counter with some form of the following: “Polls are polls, but when people vote, Democrat are doing well.” The idea being that Democrat have done well in major special and off-year elections since the 2022 midterms. The special election in NewYork’s 3rd Congressional District to succeed the infamous George Santos offers perhaps the best chance to test Democrat’ theory ahead of the presidential election. Does former Rep. Tom Suozzi win in yet another example of Democrat defying national polling trends? Or does Nassau County Legislator Mazi Pilip secure victory, showing how Republican are winning pivotal races in places Biden comfortably won in 2020? Yes, we’re looking at just one election on Long Island, but it’s a fascinating one. As we enter Election Day, the race seems far too close to call. A Newsday/Siena College poll released last week put Suozzi at 48% and Pilip at 44%, a result well within the margin of error. Throw in forecasted bad weather in this Nassau County and eastern Queens district, and we really can’t be certain who will emerge victorious. The fact that the race is tight makes sense if you look at the district’s recent voting record . I mentioned that Biden carried the seat in 2020, but local Republican have been dominating since. They did well in 2023’s local races . GOP candidates for governor and US Senate won the district by margins between 4 and 12 points in 2022, as did Santos. This means that even a narrow Suozzi victory would be impressive for Democrat given how well Republican have done in other elections in the area. Indeed, outside of Long Island, Democrat did well in last year’s big elections. They won the Kentucky gubernatorial election , maintained their majority in the Virginia Senate and flipped the Virginia House . The candidate favored by Democrat won a Wisconsin SupremeCourt race , which gave the more liberal justices a majority on that court. A lot of analysts have been skeptical about making too much of these results. Turnout in off-year elections is often low. Voters who have been showing up for these off-year races have been more Democrat-leaning than their share of all registered voter in the same states and districts     . Trump speaks at a campaign event at the Hyatt Hotel in Coralville, Iowa, on December 13. Scott Olson/Getty Images Related article Why Trump should be hoping for high voter turnout Of course, we’re now in a presidential election year, and there are also signs that these off-year results may have been pointing at something important. Yes, the turnout may have been more Democrat than among all registered voter. But the turnout in the presidential election may be as well. Most national pollsters are gauging responses from registered voter. Not all registered voter will cast a ballot in the presidential election. When pollsters such as Ipsos and The NewYork Times have honed on either those certain to vote or those likely to vote this year, Biden has done significantly better against his likely Republican opponent, Trump . Ipsos, for example, recently showed a 5-point lead for the former president among registered voter becoming a tie among those certain to vote. A Suozzi win would further prove the point that Democrat do well when voter are treated to an actual campaign. On the other hand, a win by Pilip would give us a different narrative. This is the only federal election since the midterms that has been remotely competitive. All the other competitive races were state elections, and voting patterns between US House and presidential elections are far more correlated than they are for state offices and presidential elections. While it would be easy to dismiss a Pilip win by saying that Long Island has swung to the right since 2020, the rest of the country may have as well. Remember that in the last high-turnout election, Republican won control of the US House . They did so while winning the House popular vote by 3 points. That Republican victory represented a 6-point swing from the 2020 House elections . Moreover, that 3-point Republican edge in 2022 looks a lot like Trump current advantage over Biden among registered voter nationally. In other words, it’s possible that the national environment hasn’t moved all that much from the last time Republican secured an important win. So a victory by Pilip would suggest that perhaps things aren’t all that different from where we were in 2022. This would mean that we have a closely divided electorate, but one with which Republican are favored. Either way, you can bet your last dollar that both sides will try to spin the NewYork special election result. What else would you expect when there’s been more than $10 million spent on ads , which I can report have been playing nonstop on local television.","['democrat', 'confronted', 'biden', '’s', 'poor', 'polling', 'numbers', 'often', 'counter', 'form', 'following', '“polls', 'polls', 'people', 'vote', 'democrat', 'well”', 'idea', 'democrat', 'done', 'well', 'major', 'special', 'offyear', 'elections', 'since', '2022', 'midterms', 'special', 'election', 'newyork’s', '3rd', 'congressional', 'district', 'succeed', 'infamous', 'george', 'santos', 'offers', 'perhaps', 'best', 'chance', 'test', 'democrat’', 'theory', 'ahead', 'presidential', 'election', 'rep', 'tom', 'suozzi', 'win', 'yet', 'another', 'example', 'democrat', 'defying', 'national', 'polling', 'trends', 'nassau', 'county', 'legislator', 'mazi', 'pilip', 'secure', 'victory', 'showing', 'republican', 'winning', 'pivotal', 'races', 'places', 'biden', 'comfortably', '2020', 'yes', 'we’re', 'looking', 'one', 'election', 'long', 'island', 'fascinating', 'one', 'enter', 'election', 'day', 'race', 'seems', 'far', 'close', 'call', 'newsdaysiena', 'college', 'poll', 'released', 'last', 'week', 'put', 'suozzi', '48', 'pilip', '44', 'result', 'well', 'within', 'margin', 'error', 'throw', 'forecasted', 'bad', 'weather', 'nassau', 'county', 'eastern', 'queens', 'district', 'really', 'can’t', 'certain', 'emerge', 'victorious', 'fact', 'race', 'tight', 'makes', 'sense', 'look', 'district’s', 'recent', 'voting', 'record', 'mentioned', 'biden', 'carried', 'seat', '2020', 'local', 'republican', 'dominating', 'since', 'well', '2023’s', 'local', 'races', 'gop', 'candidates', 'governor', 'us', 'senate', 'district', 'margins', '4', '12', 'points', '2022', 'santos', 'means', 'narrow', 'suozzi', 'victory', 'impressive', 'democrat', 'given', 'well', 'republican', 'done', 'elections', 'area', 'indeed', 'outside', 'long', 'island', 'democrat', 'well', 'last', 'year’s', 'big', 'elections', 'kentucky', 'gubernatorial', 'election', 'maintained', 'majority', 'virginia', 'senate', 'flipped', 'virginia', 'house', 'candidate', 'favored', 'democrat', 'wisconsin', 'supremecourt', 'race', 'gave', 'liberal', 'justices', 'majority', 'court', 'lot', 'analysts', 'skeptical', 'making', 'much', 'results', 'turnout', 'offyear', 'elections', 'often', 'low', 'voters', 'showing', 'offyear', 'races', 'democratleaning', 'share', 'registered', 'voter', 'states', 'districts', 'trump', 'speaks', 'campaign', 'event', 'hyatt', 'hotel', 'coralville', 'iowa', 'december', '13', 'scott', 'olsongetty', 'related', 'article', 'trump', 'hoping', 'high', 'voter', 'turnout', 'course', 'we’re', 'presidential', 'election', 'year', 'signs', 'offyear', 'results', 'may', 'pointing', 'something', 'important', 'yes', 'turnout', 'may', 'democrat', 'among', 'registered', 'voter', 'turnout', 'presidential', 'election', 'may', 'well', 'national', 'pollsters', 'gauging', 'responses', 'registered', 'voter', 'registered', 'voter', 'cast', 'ballot', 'presidential', 'election', 'pollsters', 'ipsos', 'newyork', 'times', 'honed', 'either', 'certain', 'vote', 'likely', 'vote', 'year', 'biden', 'done', 'significantly', 'better', 'likely', 'republican', 'opponent', 'trump', 'ipsos', 'example', 'recently', 'showed', '5point', 'lead', 'president', 'among', 'registered', 'voter', 'becoming', 'tie', 'among', 'certain', 'vote', 'suozzi', 'win', 'prove', 'point', 'democrat', 'well', 'voter', 'treated', 'actual', 'campaign', 'hand', 'win', 'pilip', 'give', 'us', 'different', 'narrative', 'federal', 'election', 'since', 'midterms', 'remotely', 'competitive', 'competitive', 'races', 'state', 'elections', 'voting', 'patterns', 'us', 'house', 'presidential', 'elections', 'far', 'correlated', 'state', 'offices', 'presidential', 'elections', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'pilip', 'win', 'saying', 'long', 'island', 'swung', 'right', 'since', '2020', 'rest', 'country', 'may', 'well', 'remember', 'last', 'highturnout', 'election', 'republican', 'control', 'us', 'house', 'winning', 'house', 'popular', 'vote', '3', 'points', 'republican', 'victory', 'represented', '6point', 'swing', '2020', 'house', 'elections', 'moreover', '3point', 'republican', 'edge', '2022', 'looks', 'lot', 'like', 'trump', 'current', 'advantage', 'biden', 'among', 'registered', 'voter', 'nationally', 'words', 'possible', 'national', 'environment', 'hasn’t', 'moved', 'much', 'last', 'republican', 'secured', 'important', 'win', 'victory', 'pilip', 'suggest', 'perhaps', 'things', 'aren’t', 'different', '2022', 'mean', 'closely', 'divided', 'electorate', 'one', 'republican', 'favored', 'either', 'way', 'bet', 'last', 'dollar', 'sides', 'try', 'spin', 'newyork', 'special', 'election', 'result', 'else', 'expect', 'there’s', '10', 'million', 'spent', 'ads', 'report', 'playing', 'nonstop', 'local', 'television']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/trump-appeal-scotus-delay-tactic-analysis/index.html,"Trump filing to the SupremeCourt over his claim for sweeping presidential immunity begins with a quote from Yogi Berra. “This application is déjà vu all over again,” the former president’s lawyers write, noting that special counsel Jack Smith had tried and failed to get the nine justices to decide the question on a fast-track basis in December. But another of the late and revered NewYork Yankees catcher’s phrases offers a better summation of Trump interminable delay-at-all-costs legal strategy designed to defer a reckoning until after November’s election — “It ain’t over till it’s over.” The ex-president asked the SupremeCourt on Monday to step in to temporarily block a US Court of Appeals decision that last week eviscerated his claims that a president is effectively above the law while in office and shielded from prosecution afterwards. The filing is Trumpian in its audacity. In essence, it argues that it would be unfair to millions of voter if the ex-President cannot get his message out in the 2024 election because he is on trial over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The former president was less concerned about the rights of voter when he sought to thwart their choice to eject him from office in 2020. After an unprecedented effort by Trump to interrupt the cherished tradition of peaceful transfers of power three years ago, Trump attorneys nevertheless insist the real “stunning breach of precedent and historical norms” is that the lower court ruled that presidential immunity for official acts does not exist at all. While Trump argues he was using presidential power in a legitimate effort to bring to light electoral fraud, there is nothing in the Constitution that gives the president the right or duty to officially administer elections, count vote or contact local election officials as the ex-president is alleged to have done. The coming days could decide when the first Trump trial takes place The text of Trump filing to the court at times feels somewhat frivolous. In tone and depth, it contrasts to the tightly argued repudiation of his claims for immunity last week by three appeals court judges that was widely praised by legal scholars. And it reflected the extraordinarily broad and improbable vision of almost unconstrained presidential power to which Trump warmed in office and that he appears to relish regaining if he wins November’s election ahead of a term he has vowed would be devoted to retribution against his enemies. “This brief, this petition for a stay, is pretty weak,” Ty Cobb, a former counsel in Trump White House, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “I don’t think the SupremeCourt is going to find these arguments compelling in any way.” Trump latest request comes at a critical moment because the steps that the SupremeCourt takes in coming days will likely decide whether this case — one of the most potentially damaging of the four criminal trials that await Trump — will go to a jury before the election. This is not just a matter of seeking accountability for the ex-president’s bid to stay in power despite losing the last election to Biden. It could also sway the destiny of the White House since some polls, including a national NBC News survey this month , suggest that some Trump voter may not support him if he’s a convicted felon when they go to vote. In what is expected to be a close election, even small-scale defections from Biden could weigh on the result. Trump legal team has a good reason to try to run out the clock. Therefore its moves should be assessed as much for their political impact as for the quality of litigation in an election season that has merged Trump legal and campaign strategies. Trump asked the SupremeCourt to put the entire case on hold to allow him to pursue the full extent of his rights as an appellant, potentially to include a so-called en banc appeal to a full bench of appeals court judges and then ultimately to the high court, a process that could take many weeks or months. But it is not certain that the SupremeCourt, which last week heard oral arguments on another Trump case — over his expulsion from Colorado’s ballot — will even agree to take his latest request. The special counsel has until February 20 to respond to Trump petition, though Smith is likely to file much earlier. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the real world impact of the new petition was that it would “almost certainly dictate whether or not Trump goes on trial on Jack Smith’s election case before or after the 2024 election.” First, the SupremeCourt must decide whether to grant a stay, but Honig said, “The bigger question is: Will the SupremeCourt ultimately take this case? If they do not take the case it’s going to go back down to the district court, and I think we are very likely looking at a trial this summer. If they do take the case and set it on something close to a normal schedule, I think in all likelihood that would push the timeline here out until after the 2024 election — that’s how big the stakes are.” Norm Eisen, another CNN legal analyst, said that the court would likely grant some kind of stay, but that even if it did decide to take the case, the court could put it on an expedited schedule. “The long-term odds for success are poor. But it’s a delay game at this point,” Eisen said. But Trump and Smith both know time is short with a trial threatening to coincide with the heat of the presidential election. “The really precarious situation that Jack Smith finds themselves in and the Justice Department find themselves in is that every day matters at this point, given the calendar and the political calendar,” Ankush Khardori, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I don’t expect them to countenance the whole delaying tactic, at least I hope that they will not, but we are now starting to cut it pretty close here.” Trump extraordinary collision of legal peril As is often the case, Trump had a crowded legal docket on Monday. The historic spectacle of a former president making an unprecedented request for blanket immunity — that appears to fly in the face of founding US principles of constraining unaccountable executive power — only emerged after an earlier court appearance. The former president took part in a closed hearing in Florida as his lawyers haggled with Smith’s team for access to classified material pertinent to the case over his hoarding of secret government documents at his resort home. As with Smith’s Washington case, Trump team is seeking to delay the trial currently scheduled for May. The former president is also expected in court on Thursday in Manhattan, in a hearing related to a hush money payment sent to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. That case is now expected to be the first of Trump four criminal trials to go ahead at the end of March — after the judge in the federal elections case postponed the start of her proceeding pending the ex-president’s appeals. Trump is hoping meanwhile that Fani Willis, the district attorney leading his Georgia election subversion case, could be dismissed following the disclosure of a personal relationship with a lead prosecutor. A hearing is set for Thursday after a judge presiding over the case said Willis could be disqualified if she financially benefited from the relationship. And in yet another fateful development in court his week for Trump, a NewYork judge is expected to issue his ruling on Friday over how much Trump will have to pay over ill-gotten gains related to a civil fraud trial targeting the former President, the Trump Organization and his adult sons. A large chunk of Trump fortune is at risk in the case as well as his capacity to do business in NewYork state. This stunning roster of cases is an oppressive load for any defendant — let alone one running for president – but it does not even complete the full extent of his legal liabilities. However, it raises the prospect of a dark period ahead for Trump if he doesn’t win the 2024 election and is not able to use presidential power to halt trials or reverse convictions in any of the federal proceedings against him.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/fact-check-trump-nato/index.html,"For a third straight presidential election campaign, former Trump is being serially inaccurate about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military alliance. Trump caused a transatlantic uproar this weekend by claiming at a Saturday campaign rally that he had once told the president of a “big” NATO country that if that country didn’t pay its “bills,” he would not protect the country from a Russian invasion and would even “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want.” Trump incendiary remarks contained a familiar false claim. His assertion about NATO allies supposedly having failed to pay “bills” is not true, as fact-checkers at CNN and elsewhere have pointed out for years. And Trump has for years made a variety of other false claims about spending by NATO and its members. Here is a fact check of five of his repeated statements. Spending by NATO members Trump has long claimed that various NATO members have failed to pay their “ bills ,” “ dues ” or “ NATO fees ,” that they “ owe us a tremendous amount of money ” or that they “ owe NATO billions of dollars .” Facts First: All of these Trump claims are false. While a majority of NATO members do not meet the alliance’s target of each member spending a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, the 2% target is a “guideline ” that does not create bills, debts or legal obligations if it is not met. In fact, the guideline doesn’t require payments to NATO or the US at all. Rather, it simply requires each country to spend on their own defense programs. When Trump was president, the guideline was written in forgiving language that made clear that it was not a firm commitment. That version of the guideline, created at a NATO summit in Wales in 2014, said members that had yet to reach 2% would “aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade with a view to meeting their NATO Capability Targets and filling NATO’s capability shortfalls.” In other words, the members that were below 2% in 2014 didn’t even have to promise to hit the target by 2024 – simply to make an effort to do so by then. NATO does require members to make direct contributions to fund the organization’s own operations. But there is no sign that members have failed to make those contributions, which constitute a tiny fraction of the allies’ defense spending, and Trump has made clear that his talk of debts  is about the 2% guideline. Stephen Saideman , the Paterson Chair in International Affairs at Carleton University in Canada, said in a Monday email that the word “inaccurate really does not cover Trump protection racket/country club perception of dues owed to the US.” “The money, as you and everyone else knows, is not sent from member states to the US or NATO. The commitment is for each country to spend enough on their own militaries – 2% of GDP, 20% of defense spending on equipment – so that the alliance as a whole is capable and can credibly deter Russia and do whatever else the alliance agrees to,” Saideman said. As of 2023, 11 of 30 NATO members were meeting the 2% target, NATO estimates show . That was up from three members in 2014. Erwan Lagadec , a research professor at George Washington University’s ﻿Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, noted in a Monday email that NATO members agreed to firmer language related to the 2% target in 2023, formally declaring that “we make an enduring commitment to invest at least 2% of our Gross Domestic Product annually on defence.” Lagadec said that “arguably for the first time the Allies HAVE made a hard commitment to reaching 2% rather than merely ‘trying to get there if possible.’” He noted, though, that even this stronger declaration “doesn’t provide a deadline” to hit 2%. Regardless, it will not create actual debts to the US or NATO. NATO members’ spending before Trump took office As president, Trump claimed that NATO members’ spending had declined “every single year” until he took office in 2017. He sometimes claimed there had been 15 , 16 or 18 years of declines. Facts First : Trump claims that NATO members’ spending had declined every year until he took office are false. Official NATO data show that non-US members’ defense spending increased in each of the two years prior to Trump presidency – by 1.6% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016. The increases came after NATO members recommitted to the 2%-of-GDP guideline at the 2014 summit in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region . Non-US members’ defense spending increases in each year of the Trump era were bigger than their increases in 2015 and 2016 – the increases were 5.9% in 2017, 4.3% in 2018, 3.6% in 2019 and 4.6% in 2020 – and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg gave Trump at least partial credit . But Trump is wrong when he claims he reversed a downward trend. “If you look at the year-on-year data, the turning point away from the nadir of European defense spending happened in 2014, pre-Trump, and clearly due to Crimea,” Lagadec said. Saideman said that while it’s possible he is undervaluing Trump impact because he generally dislikes Trump, “Putin deserves most of the credit for defense spending increases in Europe.” He said, “Everyone was cutting their defense budgets after the 2008 economic crisis and as countries started pulling out of Afghanistan, and all that changed with the seizure of Crimea.” And he argued that any increases sparked by Trump are likely less about his efforts to cajole allies than about those allies’ concerns about the US no longer keeping its commitments given what has sounded from Trump like “genuine hostility to the alliance and to the allies.” Under Biden, non-US NATO members increased their defense spending by 2.8% in 2021 and an estimated 2.0% in 2022, then by an estimated 8.3% in 2023. That large 2023 spike was “clearly in reaction to the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine” in 2022, Lagadec said. The US share of NATO spending As president, Trump repeatedly claimed that, before him, the US was “ paying for 100% of NATO ” or “ paying close to 100% .” Facts First : Trump claims are false. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members – a large majority, but not “100%” or “close to 100%.” And Trump claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover NATO’s organizational expenses and are set based on each country’s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016 . The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 68% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany; Lagadec said the US share was reduced from 22% “to placate Trump” and is a “sweetheart deal” given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance’s total GDP . What previous presidents told NATO members As president, Trump repeatedly claimed that before he pressured NATO members to increase their defense spending, US presidents did not even ask them to do so. He singled out former President Barack Obama in his comments at the rally on Saturday. After referring to NATO members Trump said he pressured himself, he continued: “And then I hear that they like Obama better. They should like Obama better. You know why? Because he didn’t ask for anything.” Facts First : Trump claims are false. Both Obama and his predecessor, President George W. Bush , repeatedly pressed other NATO members to spend more on defense, though t heir public language was less confrontational than Trump. At a news conference in Belgium in 2014, Obama said , “ If we’ve got collective defense, it means that everybody has got to chip in. And I have had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO – not all, but many. The trend lines have been going down.” In a speech in Germany in 2016, Obama said , “Every NATO member should be contributing its full share – 2% of GDP – towards our common security, something that doesn’t always happen. And I’ll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense.” In a speech to Canada’s Parliament in 2016, he said , “As your ally and as your friend, let me say that we’ll be more secure when every NATO member, including Canada, contributes its full share to our common security.” In a speech in the Czech Republic in 2002, before a NATO summit, Bush said that every NATO member needs to make a military contribution to the alliance, and “f or some allies, this will require higher defense spending.” Bush and top administration officials continued for the rest of his presidency to push for increased spending. While visiting Romania in 2008, Bush said , “Building a strong NATO alliance also requires a strong European defense capacity. So at this summit, I will encourage our European partners to increase their defense investments to support both NATO and EU operations.” The cost of NATO’s headquarters While criticizing NATO both during and after his presidency, Trump has claimed that NATO spent $3 billion on its headquarters building in Belgium. Facts First: Trump $3 billion figure is not close to accurate. NATO told CNN in 2020 that the headquarters building was constructed for a sum under the approved budget of 1.178 billion euro, or about $1.27 billion at Monday exchange rates – certainly an expensive facility, but less than half what Trump has claimed.","['third', 'straight', 'presidential', 'election', 'campaign', 'trump', 'serially', 'inaccurate', 'north', 'atlantic', 'treaty', 'organization',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/family-palestinian-american-detained-israeli-forces-alleges-mistreatment/index.html,"The family of Samaher Esmail, a Palestinian-American detained in the West Bank by the Israel Defense Forces, alleged on Tuesday that she has been beaten and denied medication while in Israeli custody, according to a statement released on their behalf. The family also said that US officials have not been granted consular access to her more than a week after her detention. The family said that Esmail, 46, was “dragged” from her home by IDF members and “beaten badly in Israeli custody.” They also said her home was destroyed in the raid. “Despite having had her prescription medication from the moment they arrested her, the IDF has declined to administer it,” the family statement said. “Despite having a clear obligation to grant Consular access, the Netanyahu government has declined daily requests from the U.S. Embassy for permission to visit Ms. Esmail.” The IDF confirmed Esmail’s detention, saying she was “arrested for incitement on social media,” but did not respond to the allegations of mistreatment raised by the family. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said he could not speak to the specific claims made by the family, citing privacy laws. “In any of these circumstances, whether it be in Israel or elsewhere, we seek consular access, we seek access to the individual and we talk to their family when appropriate,” he said at a department press briefing Tuesday. “We try to ensure that detainees or people who are arrested are treated fairly, are treated humanely, have full access to due process, have access to counsel,” he continued. “As is often the case, due to privacy considerations that are just in the law that don’t give me any wiggle room at all, I’m unable to speak in detail about this,” Miller said, but noted that his lack of ability to speak about the case should not be misinterpreted “as a lack of activity by the United States.” In a statement to CNN Tuesday, the IDF said Esmail was arrested during “a battalion operation that took place in the area of the village of Silwad to arrest terror suspects” on February 5. “All those arrested in the operation were transferred to the security forces for further treatment,” the IDF said. The IDF did not address the family’s claims about Esmail’s mistreatment in custody and referred further questions to the Israel Prison Service, to whom CNN has reached out. The IDF response also did not provide further details about the alleged “incitement on social media.” According to the family, Esmail was detained because of “10-year-old Facebook posts and political cartoons she shared.” Posts from Esmail’s Facebook seen by CNN show cartoons favorably depicting Hamas and two photos of her holding a gun. Family spokesperson Jonathan Franks said the gun is in Louisiana, where Esmail also resides and legally owns the firearm. “Ms. Esmail’s opinions may be disfavored in Israel proper, but the inescapable reality is they were protected speech which no rational person could consider an incitement to violence,” the statement released by Franks on behalf of the family said. The statement said she has not been formally charged with a crime. According to the statement, Esmail was presented to a military commission on Monday and was granted bail, but the IDF appealed the ruling. “Ms. Esmail’s ‘arrest’ is just more evidence that the Israeli government of the day is out of control. The fact that the U.S. Embassy has been denied access to Ms. Esmail for eight days is outrageous, and one wonders if the Israeli government doesn’t want a U.S. consular officer to see the bruises that Ms. Esmail’s lawyer says cover her body,” the family said. They called on the US to do more to obtain consular access to Esmail. “The United States is not without tools to obtain consular access to Ms. Esmail and to end her ordeal. It just has to find the moral courage to do so, which has been, thus far, a tall order,” the statement said. Esmail is not the only American to have been detained in the Palestinian territories recent days. Two other Americans, Hashem Alagha, 20, and Borak Alagha, 18, were detained by Israeli forces during a raid of a home in Gaza last week, according to a family member in the United States. Miller was also unable to give updates on their case, citing privacy laws. In addition to the detentions, two Palestinian-Americans have been killed in less than a month in the West Bank. 17-year-old Mohammad Ahmed Mohammad Khdour was shot in the head by Israeli forces on Saturday while traveling by car in the town of Biddu, according to the organization “Defense for Children – Palestine.” Last month, another American, 17-year-old Tawfic Abdel, was fatally shot in the head, according to Palestinian news agency WAFA. On that case, Miller noted that there is an ongoing investigation into the death, and if “that investigation finds that there should be accountability, we expect there to be accountability.” “We are still at the information-gathering process with this second case, but as is always the case, if the information leads us to believe there should be further investigation or accountability measures, we’ll, of course, call for those for those both publicly and privately,” he said","['family', 'samaher', 'esmail', 'palestinianamerican', 'detained', 'west', 'bank', 'israel', 'defense', 'forces',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/senate-foreign-aid-bill-ukraine/index.html,"The Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine and Israel in a vote early Tuesday morning, setting up a showdown with the House as Speaker Mike Johnson has said he does not plan to bring the bill to the floor. The foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine, among other priorities. The US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024. Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article How each member of the Senate voted on foreign aid package The bill passed the Senate despite Johnson’s criticism of the legislation and former Trump signaling opposition to the bill by arguing the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is in the form of a loan. The Senate vote was 70 to 29 with 22 Republican voting in favor, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “History settles every account,” McConnell said in a statement following the vote. “And today, on the value of American leadership and strength, history will record that the Senate did not blink.” The bill includes $60 billion to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia, $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel, $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance and $4.8 billion to support regional partners in the Indo-Pacific region in addition to other policy provisions, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Johnson told reporters on Tuesday that he is not planning to put the package on the House floor, setting up a major clash between the two chambers. “I certainly don’t,” Johnson said when asked if he plans to put the bill on the floor. “Right now, we’re dealing with the appropriations process, we have immediate deadlines upon us and that’s where the attention is in the House in this moment.” Biden called on House Republican to hold a vote on the bill in remarks from the White House, saying that a “minority of the most extreme voices in the House,” should not be permitted to block the bill. The president issued a stark warning, cautioning that if lawmakers fail to act, Russian President Vladimir Putin, “won’t limit himself just to Ukraine, and the costs for America and our allies and partners are going to rise.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Schumer, McConnell and “every US Senator who has supported continued assistance to Ukraine as we fight for freedom, democracy, and the values we all hold dear” in a statement Tuesday. “For us in Ukraine, continued US assistance helps to save human lives from Russian terror. It means that life will continue in our cities and will triumph over war,” Zelensky said on X. “American assistance brings just peace in Ukraine closer and restores global stability, resulting in increased security and prosperity for all Americans and all the free world.” Bill faces Johnson’s opposition in the House The Senate passed the legislation after Republican blocked a broader bill last week that would have combined foreign aid with a bipartisan border deal. Republican had initially demanded that border security be part of the bill, but went on to reject the bipartisan border deal amid forceful attacks on the measure by Trump and top House Republican. In a statement on Monday, Johnson criticized the foreign aid bill over its lack of border provisions, saying, the Senate “should have gone back to the drawing board to amend the current bill to include real border security provisions that would actually help end the ongoing catastrophe.” Johnson had previously opposed the broader bill that did include border provisions. The speaker has characterized those provisions as insufficient, despite the fact that they were the product of bipartisan negotiations and included restrictive border measures. “The House will have to figure out a path forward and they’ll have to do it their way, but we needed to start the process and we’ve done that,” Senate GOP Whip John Thune told reporters on Tuesday. House Democrat Leader Hakeem Jeffries vowed to use “every available legislative tool to get comprehensive national security legislation over the finish line” in a letter to colleagues. Democrat are limited in their options, however, if Johnson does not bring the bill to the floor. Democrat would need to get the support of a majority of the House — or 218 members when every seat is filled — to sign on to an effort to circumvent GOP leadership and force a floor vote. That effort, known on Capitol Hill as a discharge petition, rarely succeeds and would be difficult to pull off. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer celebrated passage of the legislation, saying in remarks on the floor, “It’s been years, perhaps decades, since the Senate passed a bill that so greatly impacts not just our national security, not just the security of our allies, but the security of western democracy.” “I believe that if Speaker Johnson brought this bill to the House floor, it will pass with the same strong bipartisan support,” Schumer said. Trump stance on foreign aid looms The Senate continued to move forward on the bill even as Trump argued the US should not grant foreign aid unless it is a loan, signaling opposition to the legislation. Trump has also indicated he would encourage Russian aggression against any NATO member country that doesn’t pay enough. A number of Senate Republican either defended or downplayed Trump NATO comments on Monday. “I’m 100% behind him,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville said of Trump saying NATO members should be paying their dues or risk Putin invading their country. The Alabama Republican also suggested European allies should be “very worried” about an invasion, saying they should protect themselves and not rely on the US, adding the country “can’t protect everybody.” Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said European allies who are worried about Trump comments need to “get over it.” “You know, they need to get over it. They need to stand up and be tough. We need to secure our own border first. We need to take care of things here at home first. When we secure our own border, when we take care of home, great. Let’s help other people as well,” the Republican from Kansas said. In the Senate, consideration of the bill crawled along for days as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky vowed to drag out the timeline in protest over the legislation. Paul continued to dig in on Sunday, saying that he will hold out until “hell freezes over.” He indicated he is ready to hold the floor by speaking on the issue of national debt and other matters. “I love to talk. That’s one of my favorite things to do,” he said. “We do this for a purpose,” Paul said. “I don’t like being here","['senate', 'passed', '953', 'billion', 'foreign', 'aid', 'bill', 'assistance',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/paul-whelan-blinken-phone-call/index.html,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Monday with Paul Whelan , an American who has been detained in Russia for more than five years, the top US diplomat said Tuesday. “Our intensive efforts to bring Paul home continue every single day. And they will until he and Evan Gershkovich and every other American wrongfully detained is back with their loved ones,” Blinken said at an event on hostage diplomacy at the Wilson Center. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Tuesday that Blinken “assured Paul Whelan, as he has in his previous calls, that we’re with you. We have not forgotten you. We continue to work to try to secure your release and we will continue to work to try to secure your release.” “Your release is a top priority, not just for the secretary, but for Biden as well,” Miller said. This is at least the third time the top US diplomat has spoken by phone with the ex-Marine, who has been declared wrongfully detained by the US State Department. The two also spoke in August 2023 and December 2022. Whelan told CNN that in the August call, he told Blinken “point blank that leaving me here the first time painted a target on my back and leaving me here the second time basically signed a death warrant.” Whelan has consistently urged the Biden administration to do its utmost to secure his release, expressing frustration at being left behind in two prior prisoner swaps with Russia. The US has said Russian officials refused to negotiate for his release in those swaps. On the fifth anniversary of his detention, Whelan called on Biden to “please use every resource available to secure my release as you would do if your own son had been taken hostage.” “I’m more than past ready to return home and I’m counting on the US government to come for me and soon. The time is now to take decisive action and bring this debacle to a close,” Whelan told CNN from his prison camp in Mordovia. In the more than half a dozen phone conversations Whelan has had with CNN, he has expressed both confidence that the US government is working to secure his release and immense frustration that those efforts have not yielded success. Miller reiterated on Monday that the US has “put a significant offer on the table” to try to secure Whelan and Gershkovich’s release. “In fact, more than once we have put offers on the table to secure their release, and we will continue to engage to try to pursue, or try to obtain their release,” he said at a press briefing.","['us', 'secretary', 'state', 'antony', 'blinken', 'spoke', 'monday', 'paul', 'whelan', 'american', 'detained', 'russia', 'five', 'years', 'top', 'us', 'diplomat', 'tuesday', '“our', 'intensive', 'efforts', 'bring', 'paul', 'home', 'continue', 'every', 'single', 'day', 'evan', 'gershkovich', 'every', 'american', 'wrongfully', 'detained', 'back', 'loved', 'ones”', 'blinken', 'event', 'hostage', 'diplomacy', 'wilson', 'center', 'state', 'department', 'spokesperson', 'matt', 'miller', 'tuesday', 'blinken', '“assured', 'paul', 'whelan', 'previous', 'calls', 'we’re', 'forgotten', 'continue', 'work', 'try', 'secure', 'release', 'continue', 'work', 'try', 'secure', 'release”', '“your', 'release', 'top', 'priority', 'secretary', 'biden', 'well”', 'miller', 'least', 'third', 'top', 'us', 'diplomat', 'spoken', 'phone', 'exmarine', 'declared', 'wrongfully', 'detained', 'us', 'state', 'department', 'two', 'spoke', 'august', '2023', 'december', '2022', 'whelan', 'august', 'call', 'blinken', '“point', 'blank', 'leaving', 'first', 'painted', 'target', 'back', 'leaving', 'second', 'basically', 'signed', 'death', 'warrant”', 'whelan', 'consistently', 'urged', 'biden', 'administration', 'utmost', 'secure', 'release', 'expressing', 'frustration', 'left', 'behind', 'two', 'prior', 'prisoner', 'swaps', 'russia', 'us', 'russian', 'officials', 'refused', 'negotiate', 'release', 'swaps', 'fifth', 'anniversary', 'detention', 'whelan', 'called', 'biden', '“please', 'use', 'every', 'resource', 'available', 'secure', 'release', 'son', 'taken', 'hostage”', '“i’m', 'past', 'ready', 'return', 'home', 'i’m', 'counting', 'us', 'government', 'come', 'soon', 'take', 'decisive', 'action', 'bring', 'debacle', 'close”', 'whelan', 'prison', 'camp', 'mordovia', 'half', 'dozen', 'phone', 'conversations', 'whelan', 'expressed', 'confidence', 'us', 'government', 'working', 'secure', 'release', 'immense', 'frustration', 'efforts', 'yielded', 'success', 'miller', 'reiterated', 'monday', 'us', '“put', 'significant', 'offer', 'table”', 'try', 'secure', 'whelan', 'gershkovich’s', 'release', '“in', 'fact', 'put', 'offers', 'table', 'secure', 'release', 'continue', 'engage', 'try', 'pursue', 'try', 'obtain', 'release”', 'press', 'briefing']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/biden-trump-nato-comments/index.html,"Biden on Tuesday slammed Trump after the former president said he would encourage Russia to invade countries that don’t meet their NATO obligations, saying such comments amount to bowing down to Vladimir Putin. The remarks – Biden latest criticism of Trump from the White House – are some of his harshest criticism of his likely rival on foreign policy to date. Speaking Saturday at a rally in SouthCarolina, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense. Biden said those comments sent a “dangerous and shocking” signal. “Can you imagine a former president of the United States saying that?” Biden asked incredulously from the State Dining Room. “The whole world heard it. The worst thing is he means it.” Biden began his speech by encouraging the House of Representatives to “immediately” hold a vote on the Senate-passed, $95 billion supplemental aid package that would provide assistance to Ukraine, Israel and US partners in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. More than $60 billion from the Senate package would have been allocated to Ukraine, as the country prepares to mark the second anniversary of its full-scale invasion by Russia. Previous attempts to pass an aid package – combined with a border security bill – were scuttled after Trump came out in opposition. Trump comment drew immediate consternation, not only from the American foreign policy establishment but from NATO allies, who have watched warily as Russia proceeds with its invasion of Ukraine. For Biden, who has spent much of his career working on issues related to transatlantic security, the remark was particularly galling. When he heard about the remarks afterward, the president was aghast, according to a person familiar with the matter. He later issued a statement through his campaign decrying the sentiment. The White House criticized Trump comments shortly after they were made. “Encouraging invasions of our closest allies by murderous regimes is appalling and unhinged – and it endangers American national security, global stability, and our economy at home,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement on Saturday. Trump arrives on stage during a Get Out The Vote rally at Coastal Carolina University on February 10 in Conway, SouthCarolina. Win McNamee/Getty Images But Biden criticism of Trump from the White House went a step further. In a speech that mentioned Trump by name at least a half-dozen times, Biden sought to forcefully rebut questions about American commitment to its allies. “No other president in our history has bowed down to a Russian dictator,” Biden went on. “Let me say this as clearly as I can: I never will. For God’s sake, it’s dumb. It’s shameful. It’s dangerous. It’s un-American.” On Tuesday, Biden spent a significant portion of his speech on Ukraine aid going after Trump for the remark, which he said undercut longstanding US values. “When America gives its word, it means something. When we make a commitment, we keep it and NATO is a sacred commitment,” Biden said. “Trump looks at this as if it’s a burden,” he added. He said Trump viewed the defense alliance as a “protection racket” and didn’t understand its role in protecting freedom and security. “For Trump, principles never matter. Everything is transactional,” Biden said. He said American adversaries “all cheered” when they heard Trump comments. “I will not walk away. I can’t imagine any other president walking away,” Biden said.","['biden', 'tuesday', 'slammed', 'trump', 'president', 'encourage', 'russia', 'invade', 'countries', 'don’t', 'meet', 'nato', 'obligations', 'saying', 'comments', 'amount', 'bowing', 'vladimir', 'putin', 'remarks', 'biden', 'latest', 'criticism', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'harshest', 'criticism', 'likely', 'rival', 'foreign', 'policy', 'date', 'speaking', 'saturday', 'rally', 'southcarolina', 'trump', 'encourage', 'russia', '“whatever', 'hell', 'want”', 'nato', 'member', 'country', 'doesn’t', 'meet', 'spending', 'guidelines', 'defense', 'biden', 'comments', 'sent', '“dangerous', 'shocking”', 'signal', '“can', 'imagine', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'saying', 'that”', 'biden', 'asked', 'incredulously', 'state', 'dining', 'room', '“the', 'whole', 'world', 'heard', 'worst', 'thing', 'means', 'it”', 'biden', 'began', 'speech', 'encouraging', 'house', 'representatives', '“immediately”', 'hold', 'vote', 'senatepassed', '95', 'billion', 'supplemental', 'aid', 'package', 'provide', 'assistance', 'ukraine', 'israel', 'us', 'partners', 'indopacific', 'region', 'well', 'humanitarian', 'assistance', 'palestinians', 'gaza', 'strip', '60', 'billion', 'senate', 'package', 'allocated', 'ukraine', 'country', 'prepares', 'mark', 'second', 'anniversary', 'fullscale', 'invasion', 'russia', 'previous', 'attempts', 'pass', 'aid', 'package', 'combined', 'border', 'security', 'bill', 'scuttled', 'trump', 'came', 'opposition', 'trump', 'comment', 'drew', 'immediate', 'consternation', 'american', 'foreign', 'policy', 'establishment', 'nato', 'allies', 'watched', 'warily', 'russia', 'proceeds', 'invasion', 'ukraine', 'biden', 'spent', 'much', 'career', 'working', 'issues', 'related', 'transatlantic', 'security', 'remark', 'particularly', 'galling', 'heard', 'remarks', 'afterward', 'president', 'aghast', 'according', 'person', 'familiar', 'matter', 'later', 'issued', 'statement', 'campaign', 'decrying', 'sentiment', 'white', 'house', 'criticized', 'trump', 'comments', 'shortly', 'made', '“encouraging', 'invasions', 'closest', 'allies', 'murderous', 'regimes', 'appalling', 'unhinged', 'endangers', 'american', 'national', 'security', 'global', 'stability', 'economy', 'home”', 'white', 'house', 'spokesperson', 'andrew', 'bates', 'statement', 'saturday', 'trump', 'arrives', 'stage', 'vote', 'rally', 'coastal', 'carolina', 'university', 'february', '10', 'conway', 'southcarolina', 'win', 'mcnameegetty', 'biden', 'criticism', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'went', 'step', 'speech', 'mentioned', 'trump', 'name', 'least', 'halfdozen', 'times', 'biden', 'sought', 'forcefully', 'rebut', 'questions', 'american', 'commitment', 'allies', '“no', 'president', 'history', 'bowed', 'russian', 'dictator”', 'biden', 'went', '“let', 'say', 'clearly', 'never', 'god’s', 'sake', 'dumb', 'shameful', 'dangerous', 'unamerican”', 'tuesday', 'biden', 'spent', 'significant', 'portion', 'speech', 'ukraine', 'aid', 'going', 'trump', 'remark', 'undercut', 'longstanding', 'us', 'values', '“when', 'america', 'gives', 'word', 'means', 'something', 'make', 'commitment', 'keep', 'nato', 'sacred', 'commitment”', 'biden', '“trump', 'looks', 'burden”', 'added', 'trump', 'viewed', 'defense', 'alliance', '“protection', 'racket”', 'didn’t', 'understand', 'role', 'protecting', 'freedom', 'security', '“for', 'trump', 'principles', 'never', 'matter', 'everything', 'transactional”', 'biden', 'american', 'adversaries', '“all', 'cheered”', 'heard', 'trump', 'comments', 'walk', 'away', 'can’t', 'imagine', 'president', 'walking', 'away”', 'biden']"

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/nikki-haley-joe-biden-resign/index.html,"Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Tuesday said she thinks Biden should resign, as it would be in “the best interest of the country.” Asked by radio host Hugh Hewitt during an interview if she believes the president should step down, Haley responded: “Yes, I do.” “I think the Democrat Party knows that and I think that it is not just in the best interest of their party. It’s in the best interest of the country. What I will tell you – and I have said this from the very beginning – the party that gets rid of their 80-year-old candidate is the party that will win,” Haley said. “We cannot have a country in disarray and a world on fire and have two presidential candidates in their 80s when we need someone who’s going to put eight years into making sure that we are disciplined, focused on getting our economy, the border, preventing war, and getting our country back on track,” she added. Haley has made similar calls for years – she cited Biden foreign policy as a reason he should step aside in early 2022, and last month, after it was revealed that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did not disclose a hospitalization, she said Biden should be “fired” over the controversy. But Tuesday’s remark is especially pointed as Haley is trying to gain traction ahead of a crucial GOP primary in her home state of SouthCarolina and as questions over Biden fitness for office have been renewed in the wake of special counsel Robert Hur’s report, which, although it did not charge the president with a crime, painted a picture of apparent lapses in memory after Biden failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information. The former SouthCarolina governor has frequently taken digs at Biden, who is 81, and former Trump, 77, over their age, arguing they are both too old to serve another four years as president. Haley, 52, has also been adamant about calling for term limits and mental competency tests for any politician over the age over the age of 75.","['republican', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'nikki', 'haley', 'tuesday', 'thinks', 'biden', 'resign', '“the', 'best', 'interest', 'country”', 'asked', 'radio', 'host', 'hugh', 'hewitt', 'interview', 'believes', 'president', 'step', 'haley', 'responded', '“yes', 'do”', 'democrat', 'knows', 'best', 'interest', 'best', 'interest', 'country', 'tell', 'beginning', 'gets', 'rid', '80yearold', 'candidate', 'win”', 'haley', '“we', 'cannot', 'country', 'disarray', 'world', 'fire', 'two', 'presidential', 'candidates', '80s', 'need', 'someone', 'who’s', 'going', 'put', 'eight', 'years', 'making', 'sure', 'disciplined', 'focused', 'getting', 'economy', 'border', 'preventing', 'war', 'getting', 'country', 'back', 'track”', 'added', 'haley', 'made', 'similar', 'calls', 'years', 'cited', 'biden', 'foreign', 'policy', 'reason', 'step', 'aside', 'early', '2022', 'last', 'month', 'revealed', 'defense', 'secretary', 'lloyd', 'austin', 'disclose', 'hospitalization', 'biden', '“fired”', 'controversy', 'tuesday’s', 'remark', 'especially', 'pointed', 'haley', 'trying', 'gain', 'traction', 'ahead', 'crucial', 'gop', 'primary', 'home', 'state', 'southcarolina', 'questions', 'biden', 'fitness', 'office', 'renewed', 'wake', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'hur’s', 'report', 'although', 'charge', 'president', 'crime', 'painted', 'picture', 'apparent', 'lapses', 'memory', 'biden', 'failed', 'properly', 'protect', 'highly', 'sensitive', 'classified', 'information', 'southcarolina', 'governor', 'frequently', 'taken', 'digs', 'biden', '81', 'trump', '77', 'age', 'arguing', 'old', 'serve', 'another', 'four', 'years', 'president', 'haley', '52', 'adamant', 'calling', 'term', 'limits', 'mental', 'competency', 'tests', 'politician', 'age', 'age', '75']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/house-republicans-robert-hur/index.html,"House Republican have reached out to special counsel Robert Hur to discuss having him testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee about his report on Biden’s handling of classified documents, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Hur’s report released last week did not charge the president with a crime, but it painted a picture of a forgetful commander in chief who failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information – a depiction that could hurt Biden politically and that Republican have seized on. Hur has retained Bill Burck as his personal attorney. While there is no date on the calendar, they are looking toward the end of February, one of the sources told CNN. The Justice Department declined to comment. House Republican leading the impeachment inquiry also asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to turn over the transcript of the special counsel’s interview with the president in a new letter on Monday. The Republican committee chairs are also asking the Department of Justice to supply Congress with “any recordings, notes, or summaries” of the special counsel’s interview with the president. Beyond that, Republican request the Justice Department turn over classified documents related to Ukraine as they continue to attempt to draw connections between Biden official actions as vice president and his son’s foreign business dealings at the time. “There is concern that Biden may have retained sensitive documents related to specific countries involving his family’s foreign business dealings” House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, Oversight Chair James Comer and Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith wrote in the letter. The two special counsels appointed during the Trump presidency, Robert Mueller and John Durham, both testified to Congress once they submitted their reports to the Justice Department. After expressing some reluctance, Mueller agreed to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees in July 2019 about his investigation, delivering halting and stilted responses that mostly stuck to his report. The negotiations for Mueller’s appearance stretched out for weeks, ultimately leading to an agreement where Mueller appeared after he was subpoenaed. Last June, Durham testified to the House Judiciary Committee about his investigation and report into the FBI’s probe into Trump and Russia, and he spoke behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee. Hur’s special counsel report found that Biden willfully retained classified information, including top secret documents, and knew he was in possession of some documents as far back as 2017. He also shared some of that information with the ghostwriter of his 2017 memoir. The special counsel decided not to charge the president in the case – primarily because he found that nothing proved a willful intent by Biden to illegally hold onto classified information and the president cooperated with the investigation. Yet, in a politically damaging line of reasoning, Hur wrote that one reason Biden wasn’t going to be prosecuted was because he would present to a jury as an elderly man “with a poor memory.” Biden lawyers objected to the description – calling it “investigative excess” and accusing Hur of flouting Justice Department rules and norms. The report is sure to become an issue in the 2024 campaign – where Biden likely opponent, Trump, is facing criminal charges for his handling of classified material, even though Hur made clear how different the two cases were.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-supreme-court-immunity-filing/index.html,"Trump on Monday asked the SupremeCourt to step into the charged dispute over whether he may claim immunity from prosecution, once again pressing the nine justices to resolve a question that could undermine his campaign for a second term. Trump asked the SupremeCourt to temporarily block a scathing and unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down last week that flatly rejected his claims of immunity from election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. “Conducting a months-long criminal trial of Trump at the height of election season will radically disrupt Trump’s ability to campaign against Biden,” Trump attorneys wrote in their request. RENO, NEVADA - DECEMBER 17: Republican presidential candidate former U.S. Trump delivers remarks during a campaign rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center on December 17, 2023 in Reno, Nevada. Former U.S. Trump held a campaign rally as he battles to become the Republican Presidential nominee for the 2024 Presidential election. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Related article Takeaways from the scathing appeals court ruling denying immunity to Trump The DC Circuit’s ruling “threatens immediate irreparable injury to the First Amendment interests of Trump and tens of millions of American voter, who are entitled to hear Trump’s campaign message as they decide how to cast their ballots in November.” The emergency filing instantly shoves the SupremeCourt into the unusual position of having to juggle two politically fraught matters involving the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Four days ago, the court heard a historic argument over whether Trump should be disqualified from the ballot for his actions on January 6, 2021. The special counsel’s office has until February 20 to respond, but Smith – who is eager to speed up the proceedings – is likely to file much sooner. How the SupremeCourt acts on Trump request will have huge influence on whether – and how quickly – the former president will be put on trial for criminal allegations as he seeks the Republican nomination and presidency again. Trump took the unusual step of saying he might seek to two avenues to appeal the earlier decision: An appeal to the SupremeCourt and, potentially, a separate rehearing before the full DC Circuit. That move underscored Trump unusual position in a case where he was incentivized to file at the SupremeCourt but also wants to preserve his ability to keep the immunity question before the appeals court. “Former Trump is making it rather clear that his goal is to stretch out these proceedings as much as possible,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN SupremeCourt analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. While that won’t necessarily stop the justices from treating the filing as an appeal, “it underscores Trump unambiguous endgame here, which is to play out the string for as long as the courts will let him,” Vladeck added. A panel of three DC Circuit judges set an aggressive timeline for Trump to appeal, nudging him directly to the SupremeCourt and effectively requiring him to make his request by Monday. A key part of Trump legal strategy has been to delay his criminal cases until after the 2024 election. The fight over Trump immunity had already prompted US District Judge Tanya Chutkan to postpone a trial date previously set for March 4. Chief Justice John Roberts, who handles emergency appeals from the DC Circuit, will likely set out a schedule quickly that will offer clues about the timing. Smith, eager to avoid further delay in starting a trial, is expected to push for a quick resolution. Generally, it takes the vote of five justices to grant a stay. At issue is a striking 57-page unanimous opinion from the DC Circuit on Tuesday that allowed Trump to face charges for actions he took while in office and brushed aside his claims that former presidents are immune from such prosecution. “We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter,” the court wrote. “Former Trump lacked any lawful discretionary authority to defy federal criminal law and he is answerable in court for his conduct.” Broadly, Trump argued in court that presidents might be hesitant to act if they were concerned about the prospect of criminal charges after they left office. His criminal indictment in the 2020 election interference probe, if allowed to stand, would have a “chilling effect” on future administrations, he said. But US Circuit Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Florence Pan and J. Michelle Childs rejected all of Trump arguments that those principles conferred sweeping protections to a former president. The judges were clear that the allegations against Trump are serious and left no question they believe the charges can be prosecuted. The panel repeatedly eviscerated Trump alleged behavior after the 2020 presidential election as unpresidential and constituting an assault on American institutions. The case has already made its way to the SupremeCourt once before. In December, the justices rejected a request from Smith to leapfrog the DC Circuit and decide the immunity question on an expedited basis. At that time, the court did not explain its reasoning and there were no noted dissents. Trump lawyers referenced the earlier decision in the very first line of their brief, quoting the renowned late Yankees catcher Yogi Berra. “This application is ‘déjà vu all over again,’” Trump attorneys wrote. During more than two hours of oral arguments Thursday in the separate ballot case, most of the justices appeared willing to side with Trump on the question of whether he can appear on the ballot or if his actions on January 6 made him ineligible under the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban.” The court may have to decide how it wants to handle the former president’s immunity claim at the same time it is drafting an opinion in the ballot case. Together, the cases have thrust the court into the middle of this year’s presidential election in a way it has largely managed to avoid since its decision in Bush v. Gore effectively decided the 2000 election between former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Al Gore.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/fafsa-processing-delays/index.html,"The Department of Education said Tuesday that it’s taking steps to speed up college financial aid awards for the upcoming 2024-25 school year after a bumpy rollout of the new Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA. It’s the first time students and their families are using a simpler version of the FAFSA to apply for student loans and grants. With the new form, more students are expected to be eligible for more financial aid – but the rollout has been plagued with delays. First, the form – which is usually released on October 1 – wasn’t widely available until early January. Then, after making a last-minute change to the financial aid calculation, the Department of Education said that it won’t be able to transfer students’ financial information to colleges until the first half of March – more than a month later than expected . The Department of Education has been facing criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for the delays. A group of Republican sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office last month asking for an investigation. On Monday, more than 100 Democrat lawmakers called on Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to urgently address the operational problems. “Any delays in financial aid processing will most impact the students that need aid most,” wrote the lawmakers in a letter led by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democrat Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia. Department of Education officials have repeatedly said that overhauling the FAFSA has been a major, complicated undertaking that has been made more challenging by a lack of resources. In 2022, the Biden administration requested additional funding to handle a bigger workload, but Congress left its budget the same as the year before . Steps to speed up financial aid awards On Tuesday, the Department of Education announced three steps to help free up time for colleges to prepare financial aid packages before students must make a decision about where to enroll next school year. First, the agency will select fewer FAFSA filers for an added, often lengthy, process called verification to confirm that everything on the form is accurate. In past years, about one-third of applicants were selected for the audit-like process. Previously, the Department of Education waived some kinds of verification for students submitting the FAFSA for the 2021-22 award year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Second, the department is going to suspend all new routine program reviews, which are usually conducted to confirm a college is eligible to receive federal funds. In past years, several hundred college programs were reviewed annually. The agency will still conduct the review for programs related to the most serious issues like suspected fraud. Third, the Department of Education is giving colleges more flexibility to recertify eligibility for federal aid by temporarily waiving a requirement to apply 90 days before the expiration date. “The flexibility will give more time back to those institutions at this critical moment, so they can focus on getting students the aid they need,” Cardona said on a call with reporters Monday. Last week, the Department of Education also announced that it will be providing personnel, funding, resources and technology to some colleges and universities to help them get financial aid packages to students as quickly as possible. What is the FAFSA and how has it changed? The FAFSA determines eligibility for federal Pell grants and federal student loans – and in most cases, the financial aid provided by colleges as well. The form has long been due for an update, and the new version released at the end of last year is a culmination of changes approved by Congress in 2019 and 2020. In previous years, the FAFSA could be as long as 108 questions. With the new form, some applicants will have to answer as few as 18 questions, which would take less than 10 minutes to complete, according to the Department of Education . Some information is now directly taken from a filer’s tax return so that the applicant doesn’t have to hunt down numbers on old tax returns. With the new FAFSA, an increased number of families is expected to be eligible for financial aid. In fact, the Department of Education estimates that 610,000 more students will qualify for a Pell grant on an annual basis. The Pell grant program is a key way the federal government helps students from low-income families go to college by providing eligible students with money they don’t have to pay back. And an estimated 1.5 million more students will be eligible for the maximum Pell grant amount, which typically changes each year. The Pell grant is worth up to $7,395 during the current school year.","['department', 'education', 'tuesday', 'taking', 'steps', 'speed', 'college', 'financial', 'aid', 'awards', 'upcoming', '202425', 'school', 'year', 'bumpy', 'rollout', 'new', 'free', 'application', 'federal', 'student', 'aid', 'known', 'fafsa', 'first', 'students', 'families', 'using', 'simpler', 'version', 'fafsa', 'apply', 'student', 'loans', 'grants', 'new', 'form', 'students', 'expected', 'eligible', 'financial', 'aid', 'rollout', 'plagued', 'delays', 'first', 'form', 'usually', 'released', 'october', '1', 'wasn’t', 'widely', 'available', 'early', 'january', 'making', 'lastminute', 'change', 'financial', 'aid', 'calculation', 'department', 'education', 'won’t', 'able', 'transfer', 'students’', 'financial', 'information', 'colleges', 'first', 'half', 'march', 'month', 'later', 'expected', 'department', 'education', 'facing', 'criticism', 'lawmakers', 'sides', 'aisle', 'delays', 'group', 'republican', 'sent', 'letter', 'government', 'accountability', 'office', 'last', 'month', 'asking', 'investigation', 'monday', '100', 'democrat', 'lawmakers', 'called', 'education', 'secretary', 'miguel', 'cardona', 'urgently', 'address', 'operational', 'problems', '“any', 'delays', 'financial', 'aid', 'processing', 'impact', 'students', 'need', 'aid', 'most”', 'wrote', 'lawmakers', 'letter', 'led', 'independent', 'sen', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'vermont', 'democrat', 'rep', 'bobby', 'scott', 'virginia', 'department', 'education', 'officials', 'repeatedly', 'overhauling', 'fafsa', 'major', 'complicated', 'undertaking', 'made', 'challenging', 'lack', 'resources', '2022', 'biden', 'administration', 'requested', 'additional', 'funding', 'handle', 'bigger', 'workload', 'congress', 'left', 'budget', 'year', 'steps', 'speed', 'financial', 'aid', 'awards', 'tuesday', 'department', 'education', 'announced', 'three', 'steps', 'help', 'free', 'colleges', 'prepare', 'financial', 'aid', 'packages', 'students', 'must', 'make', 'decision', 'enroll', 'next', 'school', 'year', 'first', 'agency', 'select', 'fewer', 'fafsa', 'filers', 'added', 'often', 'lengthy', 'process', 'called', 'verification', 'confirm', 'everything', 'form', 'accurate', 'past', 'years', 'onethird', 'applicants', 'selected', 'auditlike', 'process', 'previously', 'department', 'education', 'waived', 'kinds', 'verification', 'students', 'submitting', 'fafsa', '202122', 'award', 'year', 'due', 'covid19', 'pandemic', 'second', 'department', 'going', 'suspend', 'new', 'routine', 'program', 'reviews', 'usually', 'conducted', 'confirm', 'college', 'eligible', 'receive', 'federal', 'funds', 'past', 'years', 'several', 'hundred', 'college', 'programs', 'reviewed', 'annually', 'agency', 'still', 'conduct', 'review', 'programs', 'related', 'serious', 'issues', 'like', 'suspected', 'fraud', 'third', 'department', 'education', 'giving', 'colleges', 'flexibility', 'recertify', 'eligibility', 'federal', 'aid', 'temporarily', 'waiving', 'requirement', 'apply', '90', 'days', 'expiration', 'date', '“the', 'flexibility', 'give', 'back', 'institutions', 'critical', 'moment', 'focus', 'getting', 'students', 'aid', 'need”', 'cardona', 'call', 'reporters', 'monday', 'last', 'week', 'department', 'education', 'announced', 'providing', 'personnel', 'funding', 'resources', 'technology', 'colleges', 'universities', 'help', 'financial', 'aid', 'packages', 'students', 'quickly', 'possible', 'fafsa', 'changed', 'fafsa', 'determines', 'eligibility', 'federal', 'pell', 'grants', 'federal', 'student', 'loans', 'cases', 'financial', 'aid', 'provided', 'colleges', 'well', 'form', 'long', 'due', 'update', 'new', 'version', 'released', 'end', 'last', 'year', 'culmination', 'changes', 'approved', 'congress', '2019', '2020', 'previous', 'years', 'fafsa', 'long', '108', 'questions', 'new', 'form', 'applicants', 'answer', '18', 'questions', 'take', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'complete', 'according', 'department', 'education', 'information', 'directly', 'taken', 'filer’s', 'tax', 'return', 'applicant', 'doesn’t', 'hunt', 'numbers', 'old', 'tax', 'returns', 'new', 'fafsa', 'increased', 'number', 'families', 'expected', 'eligible', 'financial', 'aid', 'fact', 'department', 'education', 'estimates', '610000', 'students', 'qualify', 'pell', 'grant', 'annual', 'basis', 'pell', 'grant', 'program', 'key', 'way', 'federal', 'government', 'helps', 'students', 'lowincome', 'families', 'go', 'college', 'providing', 'eligible', 'students', 'money', 'don’t', 'pay', 'back', 'estimated', '15', 'million', 'students', 'eligible', 'maximum', 'pell', 'grant', 'amount', 'typically', 'changes', 'year', 'pell', 'grant', 'worth', '7395', 'current', 'school', 'year']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/supreme-courts-easy-out-on-trump-ballot-battle-could-lead-to-post-election-chaos/index.html,"When it comes to deciding whether former Trump should be booted from Colorado’s ballot , the easiest path the SupremeCourt could take now may wind up causing the most chaos early next year. That’s the dire warning from a group of legal experts who fear the court may punt on the biggest question of the blockbuster case challenging Trump eligibility for a second term – whether the former president took part in an insurrection – and rule that it’s up to Congress, not states, to enforce the “insurrection ban” included in the 14th Amendment. The SupremeCourt listens to oral arguments from Jason Murray, the attorney representing a group of Colorado voter challenging Trump's eligibility for the 2024 ballot, on February 8. Bill Hennessy Related article John Roberts has a united court on Trump. Now comes the hard part In interviews and court documents, legal scholars have used phrases like “catastrophic constitutional crisis,” “political instability” and “horrendously ugly” to caution the justices against taking the easy way out of a dispute they predict could “come back with a vengeance” next year if Trump wins the election. “This is volatile stuff,” said Gerard Magliocca, law professor at Indiana University and one of the nation’s foremost experts on the ban. Based on their questions during more than two hours of oral arguments Thursday, a broad majority appeared sympathetic to Trump claim that Colorado did not have the authority to remove him. But that wouldn’t answer the question of whether Congress can decide he’s ineligible to serve. If the justices decide states cannot enforce the ban – and if Trump wins the general election in November – it could prompt a fight over whether Congress must enforce it. Democrat lawmakers, the theory goes, would challenge Trump eligibility when electoral vote are counted next January. “If the court says only that states cannot enforce against presidential candidates, that is not the same as saying that Trump is eligible to serve,” said Magliocca, who backed the Colorado voter challenging Trump. “The court would be taking no view on that question. And that means that if Trump wins, people will feel free to go to Congress on January 6, 2025, and ask them to declare him ineligible.” The ballot case is separate from Trump claim of immunity from criminal prosecution, which landed at the SupremeCourt on Monday . Trump asked the high court in that case to block a ruling from the DC Circuit that rejected his claim of immunity from election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. In the ballot litigation, Trump is appealing a decision from the Colorado SupremeCourt in December that he incited the attack on the US Capitol as electoral vote were being counted in 2021. Arguments at the US SupremeCourt last week focused less on whether there was an insurrection and more on technical questions about whether states may enforce the ban. A decision could come at any time. Many experts speculate Chief Justice John Roberts may be eager to deal with the ballot case quickly and with something close to unanimity. If he is seeking a ruling that can capture support from conservative and liberal justices, he would most likely avoid discussion of whether Trump took part in an insurrection. Video Ad Feedback Why Van Jones thinks the SupremeCourt hearing was 'frustrating' 02:33 - Source: CNN Before arguments took place, some scholars were sounding an alarm about a decision that doesn’t resolve fundamental questions about Trump role on January 6, 2021. A brief filed last month by three prominent election law experts warned of a worst-case scenario they said would “fan the flames of public conflict.” “Even worse for the political stability of the nation is the prospect that Congress may actually vote in favor of his disqualification after he has apparently won election in the Electoral College,” the lawyers wrote. “Neither Mr. Trump nor his supporters, whose vote effectively will have been discarded as void, are likely to take such a declaration lying down.” And, they wrote, the rules about what happens next if Congress were to find Trump ineligible are “dangerously unclear.” How to avoid January 6 election chaos The court could avoid the uncertainty by clearly holding, for instance, that Trump wasn’t involved in an insurrection or that the 14th Amendment’s ban doesn’t apply to former presidents. Trump argued that when the insurrection ban referred to someone serving as an “officer of the United States,” that language meant federal officials appointed by the president, not the presidency itself. It might also embrace one of Trump earlier arguments that his words at a rally outside the White House before the Capitol attack were protected by the First Amendment. “Any of those… rulings would not leave the issue open to Congress,” said Edward Foley, director of the election law program at The Ohio State University and one of the authors of the brief filed at the SupremeCourt last month. A political fight over eligibility would likely be limited to Congress, but it could sweep the SupremeCourt back into the thicket, as well. “Depending on just how horrendously ugly the situation could get, the court might feel compelled to become involved,” Foley said.

including during a brief exchange between Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson , nominated by Biden, and Jason Murray, the lawyer representing the voter challenging Trump. “If we think that the states can’t enforce this provision for whatever reason in this context, in the presidential context, what happens next in this case?” Jackson asked. “Is it done?” Murray said the current case would be over but warned the underlying issue could “could come back with a vengeance.” Ultimately, Murray said, members of Congress “may have to make the determination after a presidential election if Trump wins about whether or not he is disqualified from office.” If Trump wins in November, it’s possible some Democrat would try to reject vote cast for Trump, said Derek Muller, a law professor at Notre Dame who has

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/us-concerns-russia-north-korea-relations/index.html,"North Korea watchers in Washington have fixated recently on Pyongyang’s abrupt destruction last month of a key monument dedicated to reunifying the Korean Peninsula — a move that some outside analysts view as a precursor to war with South Korea amid typically bellicose rhetoric from leader Kim Jong Un. But US officials and North Korea analysts who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity say the uproar over the reunification arch obscures a far greater strategic threat: North Korea’s burgeoning partnership with Russia. Intelligence officials in Washington are increasingly concerned about the growing ties between North Korea and Russia, and the long-term implications of what appears to be a new level of strategic partnership between the two nations, according to multiple officials familiar with the latest intelligence. Russia has repeatedly fired North Korean-supplied short-range ballistic missiles at Ukrainian targets in recent weeks. In January, high-ranking North Korean and Russian diplomats met in Moscow in advance of what North Korean state media says is a forthcoming visit to Pyongyang by Russian President Vladimir Putin himself — his first in more than 20 years. The Biden administration is concerned enough that national security adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issue with the Chinese foreign minister during a January meeting, a senior White House official told reporters late last month. If North Korea is able to use a tighter relationship with Russia to loosen China’s influence, officials fear, that could remove what some believe has been an important handbrake on Pyongyang’s nuclear testing program. “I think [Kim] is constantly looking for some kind of an edge,” a senior defense official said. A senior administration official told reporters in late January, “We are deeply concerned about the recent testing of weapons. We are deeply concerned about the growing relationship between Russia and the DPRK [Democrat People’s Republic of Korea] and what that might mean for Mr. Kim’s intentions.” Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said Pyongyang has long sought to balance Chinese influence over its affairs by pursuing dialogue with other nations — including the Soviet Union and, later, the United States. North Korea’s newly forged transactional partnership with Moscow is best understood as Kim seizing an opportunity to give himself maneuvering room with China, Lewis and others said. Risks to the US The risks that relationship poses to US interests are numerous, according to multiple analysts both inside and outside of government. Although Lewis and others believe the US often overestimates the degree of control Beijing has over North Korea, it does have influence and seeks to ensure stability on the peninsula. But North Korea is “terrified that the Chinese are going to functionally take over the country, not with an army, but culturally and financially,” Lewis said. Russia is “a very natural alliance that allows them to reduce their dependency on China,” he said. An infusion of Russian cash — and potentially Russian technology — in exchange for North Korean missiles could also jumpstart North Korea’s defense industrial base, allowing Pyongyang to update its stockpiles of conventional munitions and giving its economy a much-needed boost. That, in turn, could accelerate its missile development program. Trade with Russia could also further weaken the sanctions regime the US has placed on North Korea, also accelerating its economy and potentially bolstering its arms development program. And perhaps most alarmingly, North Korean missiles on the Russian battlefield could act as an advertisement for further sales to other rogue regimes. “These are credible battlefield tools, and should North Korea succeed in selling these, it would enable them to build more and help in their domestic deployment — and, of course, have a snowball effect to find even more customers,” said Sydney Seiler, the national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council until 2023. Lewis, Seiler and others cautioned that none of these outcomes are foretold. As always with North Korea, deciphering how the hermit kingdom may respond is like reading chicken bones. But within government, officials are watching the dynamic closely. For weeks, a blog post on an influential North Korea watchers website written by two former analysts circulated within the US government. It warned that Pyongyang’s decision to abandon reunification was a clear signal that North Korea had made the “strategic decision to go to war.” The problem, according to more than half a dozen US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence, was that the piece was wrong. “I do not think [Kim] has made a strategic decision to conflict,” the senior defense official said. “I have not seen anything indicative of strategic conflict.” Kim doesn’t seem to be preparing an attack Five US officials told CNN the US has seen no signs Kim is preparing for a potential attack on South Korea, or a broader provocation involving nuclear weapons. If anything, some analysts believe, North Korea’s public statements signal that North Korea is abandoning its reunification policy in pursuit of peace on the peninsula. Kim’s “No. 1 priority is the sustainment of his regime,” the defense official said. “That’s not a shift — that’s been a strategic priority of his entire family since the Korean War.” Lewis, Seiler and others said Kim is very consistent in publicly messaging his intentions. In speeches announcing the abandonment of reunification, Kim made clear that he was not seeking war with South Korea. “Kim went out of his way to explicitly say that one implication of rejecting reunification was that he was also rejecting reunification by force — so the clear message was that North Korea would not initiate a war with South Korea,” Lewis said, adding that it was “the weirdest reassurance in history.” That does not mean Pyongyang might not launch lower-level attacks short of all-out war, analysts said — something North Korea occasionally does for reasons that can be opaque to US intelligence. Pyongyang often uses military exercises in the region conducted by the US, South Korea and Japan beginning this time of year as an opportunity to engage in what the US terms “provocative” actions. “But it’s not war. We’re not headed to war,” Seiler said. “We are headed to what I think would be a higher-tension season, but if we stay the course, we’ll come out the other end OK.” In 2010, North Korea shelled a South Korean island, and the two sides exchanged artillery fire that killed troops on both sides. But the conflict never escalated. The senior defense official said that, for now, the US does not see any indicators that North Korea is preparing for anything like that, but noted, “I get paid to think about such possibilities.” North Korea is also unlikely to step back from its missile development program — something that defense officials watch with alarm, even as they broadly believe Pyongyang views the program as defensive rather than offensive. Officials still believe North Korea could be poised to carry out another nuclear test. And Pyongyang has made notable improvements in the solid fuels used for shorter- and longer-range missiles. Because solid fuels can be stored in the field for weeks at a time, US officials are concerned the improved technology will allow North Korea to move its missiles around and hide them from foreign surveillance more easily. “Their increasing and continual launching of missile tests — that I think is the most concerning part,” the senior defense official said. “I worry about errant missiles going off to potentially hit a populated area. Even if not deliberate, that’s an action that could be devastating.”","['north', 'korea', 'watchers', 'washington', 'fixated', 'recently', 'pyongyang’s', 'abrupt', 'destruction', 'last', 'month',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-endorse-michael-whatley-lara-trump-rnc/index.html,"Trump has endorsed North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley to succeed Ronna McDaniel as Republican National Committee chair. Alongside endorsing Whatley, Trump said in a statement that he will also throw his support behind Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, for the role of co-chairwoman at the RNC. Trump endorsement solidifies his effort to bring about a leadership change and exert control over the committee. As part of the plan, Chris LaCivita, Trump co-campaign manager, has been tapped to serve as the RNC chief operating officer but will continue in his current role. “For these reasons, I think my friend Michael Whatley should be the RNC’s next leader. Michael h﻿as been with me from the beginning, has done a great job in his home state of North Carolina, and is committed to election integrity, which we must have to keep fraud out of our election so it can’t be stolen,” Trump said in a statement. Michael Whatley, North Carolina Republican Party Chairman, speaks during a campaign event for Trump in Dallas, North Carolina, in October 2020. Al Drago/Reuters Related article Likely frontrunner for RNC chair parroted Trump 2020 election lies “My very talented daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, has agreed to run as the RNC Co-Chair. Lara is an extremely talented communicator and is dedicated to all that MAGA stands for. She has told me she wants to accept this challenge and would be GREAT!” he also said. The endorsements from Trump come after weeks of behind-the-scenes jockeying to lead the RNC as tensions between the GOP front-runner and the committee spilled into public view. Trump and his top advisers had recently become dissatisfied with McDaniel’s leadership, resulting in pressure for the chairwoman to step down. That pressure became apparent when the former president met with McDaniel for two hours at Mar-a-Lago just days after the RNC’s annual winter meeting. As CNN previously reported , McDaniel had offered to leave her position following the SouthCarolina primary later this month to allow the former president to install his own party chair, according to two party advisers. It’s not unusual for a party nominee to quickly move to change leadership and install key lieutenants in their national committee after becoming either the de facto or official nominee. While Trump has not yet secured his party’s nomination, he is the far-and-away front-runner in the GOP primary. Polls show the former president leading former Gov. Nikki Haley in the upcoming SouthCarolina Republican primary. Trump endorsement carries substantial weight among the 168 Republican National Committee members, who elect a new chair and co-chair. Haley’s campaign responded to the endorsements Monday night, saying that Trump “is rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.” “Under Trump and current RNC leadership, Republican lost elections in 2018, 2020, and 2022, and now the RNC is effectively bankrupt,” campaign manager Betsy Ankney said in a statement, adding that Haley would push for everyone at the RNC to be fired. Whatley had emerged in recent days as a favorite of Trump for the chairmanship. SouthCarolina Republican Party Chairman Drew McKissick and Florida Republican National Committeeman Joe Gruters had also been mentioned, but Trump and his team strongly signaled their preference for Whatley. A CNN KFile review of Whatley’s comments following the 2020 presidential election found that he promoted lies and supported using the courts to overturn the results. Whatley, who has since acknowledged Biden is the country’s legitimate president, serves as general counsel at the RNC overseeing litigation and what the organization calls its “election integrity” efforts.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/cq-brown-nato-trump/index.html,"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown said Monday that “US credibility is at stake” in the wake of comments from former Trump that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO partners that don’t meet spending guidelines on defense. Asked by “NBC Nightly News” about Trump admission that he would not abide by the collective-defense clause at the heart of NATO if reelected, Brown said that the alliance is strong and has been around for 75 years. “I think we have a responsibility to uphold those alliances,” Brown told NBC’s Lester Holt in an interview airing Monday evening. “US credibility is at stake with each of our alliances, and US leadership is still needed, wanted, and watched.” “The US is committed,” Brown added. “And that’s the message I communicate, and that’s the message that’s been received.” Brown’s remarks come as Trump, the 2024 Republican front-runner, has come under fire for his comments over the weekend indicating he does not intend to defend NATO allies from Russian attack if he is reelected. Trump speaks as he holds a campaign rally at Coastal Carolina University ahead of the SouthCarolina Republican presidential primary in Conway, SouthCarolina, on February 10. Sam Wolfe/Reuters Related article Trump will pull US out of NATO if he wins election, ex-adviser warns At a rally in SouthCarolina Saturday, Trump recalled a conversation he had while president with “one of the presidents of a big country,” who asked him whether the US would defend them from a Russian invasion even if they “don’t pay.” “No, I would not protect you,” he recalled saying. “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.” According to NBC , Brown said that he realizes there will be “various dialogue in discussions at the political level,” but that he will focus on “continuing to build and strengthen our relationship with NATO.” “My job is to make sure that we are doing everything we can with our NATO allies on the military aspect,” he said, “and I’ll continue to do that throughout.” Brown, who was sworn in as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff last fall, serves as the principal military advisor to the president. The military officer who serves in the role does so at the pleasure of the president, meaning that if Trump were reelected this year, Brown could serve as his chairman unless he appointed another officer. Gen. Mark Milley , Brown’s predecessor and Trump chairman of the Joint Chiefs throughout his tenure, was a frequent target of Trump ire, and the two have taken verbal - sometimes subtle - shots at each other after Trump left the White House. In late September, at the change of command ceremony between Milley and Brown, the outgoing chairman made it a point to underscore where his loyalty and the loyalty of the military should lie. “We don’t take an oath to a king, or a queen, or a tyrant or a dictator. And we don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,” Milley said at the time, in a veiled reference to Trump. “We take an oath to the Constitution and we take an oath to the idea that is America – and we’re willing to die to protect it.” Milley chose to deliver the scathing criticism of his former boss in his last address as the nation’s top general as he stood next to Biden. In a continuation of the acrimonious feud between the two, Trump fired back on social media, calling Milley a “moron” and “STUPID & VERY DANGEROUS!” Brown addressed recent criticism of his boss Monday following mention of apparent memory lapses in special counsel Robert Hur’s report , calling Biden “pretty sharp.” Asked whether he was surprised by the comments made about the president’s memory, Brown said he was, adding they were “not characteristic of what I’ve seen.” “He’s got a very good grasp of the issues,” Brown said. “He asks, I think, very pertinent questions.” Iran likely ‘not looking for a broader conflict’ with US As the US is navigating increasingly high tensions in the Middle East — from Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria, the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, and Israel’s campaign in Gaza against Hamas — Brown echoed comments made by other US officials that deterrence is key. Broadly, the US is focused on deterring “any further aggression,” Brown said, while also protecting American forces. Asked whether he believed Iran wants a war with the US, Brown responded, “I don’t know that they do.” “Having watched Iran operate, they will do things through their militia groups and others to put pressure, to achieve their objectives,” the chairman said. “At the same time, not looking for a broader conflict with the United States.” There have been at least 170 attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq, Syria and Jordan since October 17. The Pentagon said Monday that those attacks have resulted in 186 wounded or killed in action — including 130 traumatic brain injuries. Three US soldiers were killed in a drone attack in January on a US outpost in Jordan","['chairman', 'joint', 'chiefs', 'staff', 'gen', 'cq', 'brown', 'monday', '“us', 'credibility', 'stake”', 'wake',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/biden-netanyahu-israel-gaza/index.html,"Biden has grown increasingly frustrated behind the scenes with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, telling advisers and others that the prime minister is ignoring his advice and obstructing efforts to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, according to people familiar with the matter. So far, Biden has stopped short of directly criticizing Netanyahu in public. But he has become increasingly critical of Israel’s tactics, saying last week he believes the campaign in Gaza is “over the top,” one of his sharpest condemnations to date of the military effort against Hamas. In private, Biden has been more willing to offer unvarnished thoughts on Netanyahu, including his deep irritation that the Israeli prime minister has not followed through on American recommendations to de-escalate military tactics in Gaza. Some officials now wonder how much longer Biden will withhold public criticism of Netanyahu as the war rages on. The president’s comments last week on Israel’s tactics reflected sentiments he has been voicing behind the scenes for a while, one person familiar with the matter said. US officials had hoped that by January, Israel would have transitioned to a lower-intensity, hyper-localized targeting campaign. The tension between the Biden administration and Netanyahu’s government has only intensified in recent days over Israel’s preparations for a ground incursion into Rafah, where thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled over the course of the war. Video Ad Feedback On GPS: What do Israelis think of the war? 06:14 - Source: CNN US officials have been direct in their conversations with Israeli counterparts that the estimated 1.3 million people currently in Rafah simply “have nowhere to go,” according to a senior administration official. The Biden administration is highly skeptical about whether Netanyahu’s direction to Israel’s military for an “evacuation of the population” out of Rafah before Israel forces go in is even remotely feasible. “We have made very clear that an operation under current conditions is not something that we could envision,” the US official said. In the call, Biden told Netanyahu an operation in Rafah “should not proceed” without ensuring the safety of the more than 1 million people sheltering there, the White House said. Biden has long had his differences with Netanyahu and officials acknowledge their relationship is complex. But in recent days, a series of actions and comments have angered some American officials, who like Biden are losing patience with Netanyahu’s resistance to US advice and recommendations. That includes publicly rejecting as “crazy” a Hamas counter proposal on a deal to release hostages and pause the fighting, even as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in the region to try to advance the agreement. The majority of a 45-minute phone call between Biden and Netanyahu on Sunday was about the hostages deal, according to an official. Biden and his team have also been irritated by Netanyahu’s public rejections of a two-state solution, long a lynchpin of American policy in the region. Biden and Netanyahu, who have known each other for more than four decades, have found themselves frequently at odds, both before the October 7 Hamas attacks and after. Biden has bemoaned Netanyahu’s far-right governing coalition and told donors last year that his counterpart’s political predicament was making it difficult for the prime minister to alter his approach to Gaza. The president is also under pressure from progressive Democrat to do and say more about the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza, including through now-frequent protests at his public events. Still, White House officials have long said the president believes any differences with his counterpart are best aired behind the scenes rather than in public. Biden has made light of his disagreements with Netanyahu, recounting an inscription he wrote on an old photograph of the two men: “Bibi, I love you, but I don’t agree with a damn thing you have to say.” “It’s about the same today,” Biden said in December. Since then, however, frustrations have only mounted over Israel’s military campaign and tactics when it comes to negotiating a deal to secure the release of hostages. Biden offered his Israeli counterpart and the people of Israel his unwavering support in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 attack, even flying to the war zone to show what he said was his and the United States’ unequivocal support for their ally. Netanyahu, meanwhile, offered Biden praise over the weekend as the president was combatting questions about his age and mental acuity. In an interview, the Israeli prime minister said he found Biden “very clear, very focused” when asked about special counsel Robert Hur’s description on Biden as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” In an interview with ABC News, Netanyahu said he’s had over a dozen “extended phone conversations” with Biden. “He also came on a visit to Israel during wartime, which was a historic first, and I found him very clear and very focused,” Netanyahu said. “We managed to agree on the war aims and on many things. Sometimes disagreements, but they weren’t born of a lack of understanding on his part or on my part,” Netanyahu said.","['biden', 'grown', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'behind', 'scenes', 'israeli',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/meet-5-democrats-floated-possible-biden-replacements,"White House won't commit to having Biden's doctor answer press questions Rep. Mark Green joins ""Fox & Friends"" to argue that the special counsel's report on Biden's mental acuity needs to be released and discusses the House's second upcoming attempt to impeach DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The scrutiny aimed at Biden following the damaging report released last week by Special Counsel Robert Hur has breathed new life into the belief that Democrat will ultimately replace him as the party's nominee ahead of the 2024 general election. In building his argument for why no charges were recommended following an investigation into Biden's mishandling of classified documents, Hur detailed in part that Biden's defense of any potential charges could possibly be that ""Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" The report cited examples when investigators said the president's memory lapsed , including when his older son, Beau, died, and caused heightened concern among Democrat who previously backed the president despite Republican attacks on his ability to serve. Here are five of the top names being mentioned as a potential replacement for Biden should he decide — or is pressured — not to run for a second term: Biden TAKS JAB AT HUR REPORT WITH JOKE ABOUT HIS MEMORY, RETURNS AFTER SPEECH: ‘ONE MORE THING I FORGOT’ From left: California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former first lady Michelle Obama, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Vice President Harris. 1. California Gov. Gavin Newsom Newsom has perhaps been the most mentioned name as a potential presidential nominee, given his outspoken criticism of national Republican figures as well as his high-profile clash with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at a debate hosted by Fox News last year. Democrat strategists and members of the media continually mention him as a future presidential hopeful, but that future could come sooner rather than later should Biden's plans change. Douglas Schoen, a former adviser to President Clinton, wrote in an op-ed last summer that Newsom ""wants to run for president in 2024"" but was backing Biden for reelection to garner support for himself. Biden'S MEMORY STRUGGLES COULD IMPERIL NATIONAL SECURITY, DEFENSE EXPERTS WARN: ‘NOT ONLY WEAK BUT CONFUSED’ ""Gavin Newsom wants to run for president in 2024, that much is clear. The California governor would not be campaigning for Biden in red states with 16 months until the presidential election if he wasn’t trying to prove his own political bona fides and build a future base of national support for himself,"" he wrote. A Washington Post columnist praised Newsom last year for running a ""shadow campaign"" for president, calling it a ""patriotic"" move, although Newsom has denied any such effort. He has, however, undertaken multiple international trips and engaged with foreign leaders. California Gov. Gavin Newsom 2. Vice President Harris Harris' presidential ambitions have been known since her first unsuccessful run for the White House in 2020, when she failed to gain support over her Democrat primary opponents, including Biden. Despite her low approval rating and frequent gaffes as vice president, she continues to insist she's ""ready to serve"" as commander in chief, if necessary. GOP SENATOR FUMES OVER Biden ADMIN PROVIDING VETERAN MEDICAL RESOURCES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS Media figures have also mentioned her as a potential replacement for Biden , including the hosts of ABC's daytime talk show, ""The View,"" who suggested she could be a better nominee than Biden in the wake of the Hur report. ""Why not the vice president? Why wouldn't Democrat put up the vice president?"" one host said. Biden signs an executive order beside Vice President Harris at the White House on Oct. 30, 2023. 3. Former first lady Michelle Obama Obama has been one of the more surprising names floated as a potential replacement for Biden, considering her lack of political experience, although the same could have been said for former Trump during his first White House run. Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, one of the first to float the theory that Obama would replace Biden, doubled down after the release of the Hur report. He has been joined by other media figures and former officials . WATCH: SUPER BOWL AD FEATURES MARINE DRILL INSTRUCTOR RUNNING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THROUGH BOOT CAMP ""The main obstacle stopping the Democrat Party is they have a Kamala Harris problem, which is to say that if they do sideline Biden, the natural person normally that would be the nominee could be the vice president of that same sitting president. But that vice president is unable, I think, to effectively carry forward that job,"" Ramaswamy told Fox News Digital . ""If race and gender are your basis for selecting someone for a job, and the identity of your party is tied to that temple of identity politics, then they will risk looking hypocritical if they sideline her after they sideline Biden. And I do think Michelle Obama offers them a convenient path out of that problem,"" he added. One media host noted over the weekend that Las Vegas odds makers give Obama a better shot at becoming president than Newsom, Harris, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Former first lady Michelle Obama 4. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Despite declining a run for the White House this year, Whitmer appeared to leave the door open for a future presidential run after her convincing reelection win during the 2022 midterm elections, a year that was expected to be a difficult one for Democrat. Whitmer first gained popularity during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, which later turned into a sharp divide over how she handled lockdowns in her state. Nonetheless, it put her on the charts as a national player in Democrat politics. TREASURY CONFIRMS TERMS LIKE ‘MAGA,’ ‘Trump,’ ‘KAMALA,’ ‘Biden’ USED IN PRIVATE BANK TRANSACTION SEARCHES In November, ""Real Time"" host Bill Maher took a swipe at Whitmer , accusing her of running a ""shadow campaign"" for president during an interview with Biden primary challenger Dean Phillips, but Maher did not say what made him believe that. Phillips told Maher that before he decided to run for president against Biden, he unsuccessfully tried to recruit Whitmer, saying she would make an ""outstanding president."" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 5. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear Beshear has been seen as a rising star within the party given his status as one of the most popular governors in the country, despite being a Democrat leading a red state. That status grew following a big reelection win last year over then-Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who was considered a rising GOP star. Multiple former officials and people familiar with Beshear's rise told Fox News Digital after his election victory last year that he would be someone to watch as a national political player for Democrat, and he didn't rule out any future aspirations. Media outlets across the country also sang Beshear's praises after his victory, suggesting his future was bright.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/stefanik-demands-new-york-ag-letitia-james-disbarred-trump-case,"Democrat are 'refusing' to hold Biden accountable for this border crisis: Rep. Elise Stefanik Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., discusses the border crisis, the release of the impeachment articles against DHS Secretary Mayorkas crisis, the inquiry against the president, and the investigation into antisemitism on college campuses. House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is calling for NewYork Attorney General Letita James to be disbarred over her handling of the Trump Organization civil fraud trial, according to a letter obtained by Fox News Digital. Stefanik filed an ethics complaint against James with NewYork state’s Committee on Professional Standards on Tuesday and accused the Democrat official of weaponizing political bias against former Trump. ""NewYork Attorney General Letitia James violated the Rules of Professional Conduct by conducting a biased investigation and prosecution of Trump and by attacking Trump through extrajudicial statements during a trial,"" Stefanik wrote. Trump ATTORNEY SOUNDS ALARM ON NY AG LETITIA JAMES AMID CIVIL FRAUD CASE: ‘SHE CAMPAIGNED ON Trump’ House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, left, is filing an ethics complaint against NewYork State Attorney General Letitia James. ""In just the first five weeks of the trial that began in October 2023 – before I stopped counting – Ms. James made over 50 highly inappropriate and prejudicial comments on social media. This complaint respectfully requests that the Attorney Grievance Committee conduct an investigation and issue an immediate interim suspension, disbar Ms. James as an attorney and counselor-at-law, or suspend Ms. James."" She accused James of having ""pursued a personal vendetta against Trump since he first was elected"" to the White House. WATCH: Trump LAYS INTO ‘CORRUPT' NEW YORK AG LETITIA JAMES FOR BEING ‘STUCK’ OFF CAMPAIGN TRAIL AT FRAUD TRIAL Rep. Elise Stefanik accused NewYork Attorney General Letitia James of acting with political bias in her case against former Trump. James had made clear even before taking office as attorney general in 2019 that she had her sights set on Trump. During her 2018 election night party, she vowed to shine light in ""every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn."" Last month, as part of her ongoing trial, James called for $370 million in fines against the former president and his co-defendants, as well as a total ban on his participation in NewYork’s real estate industry. Trump UNLOADS ON JUDGE, NY AG FOR TARGETING HIM ‘FOR POLITICAL REASONS’ DURING UNPRECEDENTED TESTIMONY ""It’s been her explicit mission since she announced her run for office to go after Trump. Such behavior not only undermines the integrity of the legal process but also violates the Rules of Professional Conduct to which James, as a licensed attorney, is bound,"" Stefanik told Fox News Digital. Rep. Elise Stefanik has generated buzz as a potential vice presidential pick for former Trump. Her conduct not only constitutes a breach of her professional responsibilities but also risks irreparable harm to the public's already eroding trust in our legal institutions."" Stefanik, the No. 3 House Republican, is among Trump most vocal allies in Congress. She has also generated speculation as a potential vice presidential pick for the former president’s re-election campaign. Elizabeth Elkind is a reporter for Fox News Digital focused on Congress as well as the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and politics.

More than half of Americans believe Biden got ""special treatment"" in the special counsel investigation into his mishandling of classified documents, according to a new poll. The Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 53% of Americans believe Biden got off easy because he is president. Roughly 29% of Democrat also agreed Biden got special treatment. The results come after Special Counsel Robert Hur chose not to recommend charges against Biden for mishandling classified documents, in part because Biden could present himself to the jury as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" Hur's report went on to describe significant memory issues for Biden, saying the president could not remember when his son, Beau, died. He also failed to remember what years he served as vice president under President Obama. Biden ALLIES GO ON DEFENSE BLITZ FOLLOWING HUR REPORT: 'BUCKET OF BS' More than half of Americans believe Biden got ""special treatment"" in the special counsel investigation into his mishandling of classified documents, according to a new poll. Biden's age and mental capacity have long been top issues for voter. Polls have found that large majorities of Americans believe he is too old to run for office, and Tuesday's Reuters poll is no different. Roughly 78% of respondents said he is too old to serve a second term, and 71% of Democrat agreed. Biden LEAD OVER Trump SHRINKS WITH THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES ADDED Ipsos conducted the poll from Feb. 9 through Feb. 12, surveying 1,237 U.S. adults. The poll used the probability-based Knowledge Panel to ensure respondents represented the U.S. population. The poll advertised a margin of error of 2.91%. Special Counsel Robert Hur's report detailed significant memory issues for Biden. Biden and the White House have dismissed concerns about his fitness for office. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated on Monday that the president's upcoming physical exam will not include a cognitive test. Jean-Pierre stated that Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, believes Biden proves his cognitive ability ""every day [in] how he operates and how he thinks."" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated on Monday that the president's upcoming physical exam will not include a cognitive test. Biden himself attempted to laugh off his memory issues on Monday.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vulnerable-house-dem-backpedals-refusing-condemn-phrase-extermination-jews,"Harvard under new fire for antisemitism task force pick Harvard law student Jonathan Frieden weighs in after a professor who previously signed a letter accusing Israel of wanting to ethically cleanse Gaza was picked for the university's antisemitism task force. FIRST ON FOX: A House Democrat facing what is expected to be a tough re-election battle refused to condemn a controversial phrase defined as code for the ""extermination"" of Israel during a clash on social media with her Republican opponent. Last week, Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-Conn., who has previously broken with many in her party to denounce antisemitism, got into a fierce back-and-forth with Republican House hopeful George Logan, who questioned where she stood on the phrase ""from the river to the sea,"" a common phrase being chanted by anti-Israel protesters amid the largely Jewish nation's war against Hamas terrorists . Logan first referenced the phrase by noting Biden's education secretary, Miguel Cardona, had declined to say whether the chant was antisemitic while speaking with reporters at a briefing earlier this month. SWING DISTRICT DEMOCRAT WITH CLOSE TIES TO LARGEST TEACHERS UNION SILENT ON CALLS TO RESCIND Biden ENDORSEMENT Representative Jahana Hayes speaks during a news conference regarding the baby formula shortage on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on May 17, 2022. ""Theres nothing unclear about ‘from the River to the Sea.’ This is an antisemitic chant promoting the destruction of Israel. As a member of [the House Committee on Education & the Workforce], where does [Hayes] stand?"" Logan wrote on X. ""STOP George,"" Hayes responded. ""You have no moral high ground. You’ve been completely silent about Trump and your MAGA cronies hateful antisemitic tropes. I’m not playing this game with you - people are dying. Stop using this topic as a political game. Count me out!"" ‘SQUAD’S' JAMAAL BOWMAN HONORED RADICAL BLACK ACTIVIST, CONVICTED MURDERER ON MIDDLE SCHOOL'S ‘WALL OF HONOR’ Republican strategist Liz Kurantowicz responded to Hayes, blasting her for not answering the question and declaring that calls for the destruction of Israel were ""not a game."" ""Same thing to you Liz- just stop! Trump called people vermin and is modeling dictators and you’ve been SILENT! And yes, I met with Muslim constituents & Jewish constituents who have been devastated by the events in Oct 7th. If George lived in the 5th- I’d meet with him too,"" Hayes wrote back, throwing a jab at Logan by accusing him of not residing in Connecticut's 5th Congressional District. Hayes told Fox News Digital, ""I have never used that phrase. The fact that it invokes so much pain is enough for me. My voting record denouncing antisemitism is clear. I condemn antisemitism in any form. I will not engage with Logan or any of the [Connecticut] GOP in using Israel or this crisis as a political game."" Nathan Sales , a former counterterrorism official, told Fox News last year that when pro-Palestinian protesters chant ""Palestine from the river to the sea,"" they are really calling for the ""extermination of the Jewish state.""

The Senate passed a $95 billion national security supplemental package to assist Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific after a tedious procedural process that came to an end early Tuesday morning. The final vote was 70 to 29, with 22 Republican voting yes. Democrat Sens. Peter Welch and Jeff Merkley, plus independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, voted no. The supplemental package does not include any border security provisions and comes as the national debt soars above $34 trillion. Calls to offset the spending with cuts elsewhere went unheeded. Several Republican spent hours — since the beginning of the weekend — collectively filibustering the package on the Senate floor. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, committed to filibustering the bill for four hours on Saturday and continued early Tuesday. The package includes $60 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, $9 billion in humanitarian assistance for Gaza and nearly $5 billion for the Indo-Pacific. Democrat brought the package up for a vote after Republican had blocked the $118 billion package that also included numerous border and immigration provisions — negotiated by a group of bipartisan senators and Biden officials — last Wednesday. U.S. NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER: SEE WHAT AMERICAN TAXPAYERS OWE IN REAL TIME The U.S. has already spent more than $100 billion in aid for Ukraine since its war against Russia began in Feb. 2022. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of NewYork; and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, pose for a photo before a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., prior to a meeting on July 27, 2023. ""I applaud the bipartisan coalition of Senators who came together to advance this agreement, and I urge the House to move on this with urgency. We cannot afford to wait any longer,"" Biden said in a statement Tuesday. ""The costs of inaction are rising every day, especially in Ukraine. Already, we are seeing reports of Ukrainian troops running out of ammunition on the front lines as Russian forces continue to attack and Putin continues to dream of subjugating the Ukrainian people. There are those who say American leadership and our alliances and partnerships with countries around the world do not matter. They do. If we do not stand against tyrants who seek to conquer or carve up their neighbors' territory, the consequences for America's national security will be significant."" In a press conference Tuesday morning, Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. praised the package as ""one of the most historic and consequential bills"" to ever pass in the upper chamber. ""The responsibility now falls on Speaker [Mike] Johnson, and House Republican to approve this bill swiftly,"" Schumer said. ""And I call on speaker Johnson to rise to the occasion to do the right thing."" However, a showdown between the two chambers is on the horizon, as Speaker Johnson, R-La., said in a statement Monday evening the House would not pass the Senate's foreign aid package, but instead draft their own bill with border security provisions included. ""The mandate of national security supplemental legislation was to secure America’s own border before sending additional foreign aid around the world,"" Johnson said. ""It is what the American people demand and deserve. Now, in the absence of having received any single border policy change from the Senate, the House will have to continue to work its own will on these important matters. America deserves better than the Senate’s status quo."" On Monday, a number of GOP senators were optimistic about a breakthrough to have their amendments addressed, primarily focused on stringent border security measures. However, none of the amendments were brought forward for consideration due to neither party agreeing to the list of filed amendments. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, introduced an amendment identical to the House's immigration bill, H.R. 2, which would restore most Trump-era restrictions, hire additional border patrol officers and tighten asylum screenings. SENATE REPUBLICANS PREPARE FOR LONG HAUL IN FIGHT OVER UKRAINE, ISRAEL AID Sen. Rand Paul speaks during the COVID Federal Response Hearing on Capitol Hill on June 16, 2022, in Washington, D.C. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a hawkish figure against continued aid to Ukraine, said on the floor before the final vote on Monday that the bill ""gives the finger to American taxpayers."" ""This bill gives the finger to all of America — this bill is Ukraine first, America last,"" he said. Republican Sens. Roger Marshall, JD Vance, and Josh Hawley were just a few other senators who spoke in opposition to the bill on Monday, continuing the filibuster. Meanwhile, GOP Sens. Mitt Romney and Thom Tillis were just a few who urged their colleagues to ""delay"" no further and pass the package. Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas became emotional in a floor speech in support of the bill. ""I believe in America first, but unfortunately America first means we have to engage in the world,"" Moran said. Which Republican voted yes on the foreign aid bill? – John Boozman – Shelley Moore Capito – Bill Cassidy – Susan Collins – John Cornyn – Kevin Cramer – Mike Crapo – Joni Ernst – Chuck Grassley – John Hoeven – John Kennedy – Mitch McConnell – Jerry Moran – Lisa Murkowski – James Risch – Mitt Romney – Mike Rounds – Dan Sullivan – John Thune – Thom Tillis – Roger Wicker – Todd Young Democrat brought the package up for a vote after Republican had blocked the $118 billion package that also included a slew of border and immigration provisions on Wednesday. Republican had previously said they would not approve funding for Ukraine unless the overwhelmed southern border was secured first. Conservatives joined with some liberal Democrat in shutting down the bill, so Schumer prepared a vote on the $95 billion foreign aid package without the border package as a backup plan. PENTAGON FINALLY RUNS OUT OF MONEY FOR UKRAINE, URGES 50 ALLIES TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING KYIV Biden welcomes Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, Dec. 21, 2022. Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had backed funding for Ukraine, but drew criticism from party members who urged lawmakers not to pass foreign aid without securing the border first. ""I know it’s become quite fashionable in some circles to disregard the global interests we have as a global power, to bemoan the responsibilities of global leadership,"" McConnell said on the floor on Super Bowl Sunday. Negotiators worked for months and last weekend finally released their text. In addition to the foreign aid package, the failed border package included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average","['senate', 'passes', '953b', 'foreign', 'aid', 'package', '7029', 'chad', 'pergram', 'reports', 'latest', 'bills', 'passage', 'join', 'access', 'content', 'plus',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/polls-close-in-special-congressional-election-seen-bellwether-ahead-likely-biden-trump-rematch,"GOP hopeful Mazi Pilip issues warning: 'This seat is about saving our country' NewYork congressional candidate Mazi Pilip joins 'Fox & Friends' ahead of her district's special election to share her final message as voter head to the polls. GARDEN CITY, N.Y. - The polls have closed in NewYork's 3rd Congressional District, in a closely watched special election for a vacant House seat once held by former Republican Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from the chamber in December. With the GOP hanging on to a razor-thin majority in the House, national Republican and Democrat have poured big bucks into a race in suburban NewYork City where immigration and border security , crime, and abortion are top issues, and where the election is seen as a bellwether ahead of the all-but-certain November White House rematch between Biden and former Trump. The Long Island district held for a decade by Democrat was flipped by Santos in the 2022 midterms. But Santos was kicked out of Congress less than a year into his tenure, after he was exposed for lying about his background and indicted for a slew of financial crimes. Former three-term Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi, who's running to reclaim his old seat, has repeatedly tied Republican candidate Mazi Pilip to Santos, as well as to former Trump. ELECTION DAY SNOWSTORM HITS AS CANDIDATES IN CRUCIAL SPECIAL HOUSE ELECTION MAKE CLOSING CASES Former U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi speaks during a campaign canvass kick off event, Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024, in Plainview N.Y. The race to replace disgraced former Rep. George Santos pits Democrat congressional candidate Suozzi against Republican Mazi Pilip in NewYork's 3rd district. ""Who knows what she really stands for? She's George Santos 2.0. It's the exact same nontransparent, phony baloney, just trying to get vote instead of saying what you really think,"" Suozzi charged on the eve of the election. And Suozzi, a former mayor and county executive, argued that Pilip – who is in her second term as a county lawmaker – ""is a far-right wing extremist"" who is ""totally in line with Mike Johnson and Trump ."" NEW YORK SPECIAL ELECTION CANDIDATES CLASH OVER BORDER CRISIS, ABORTION: 'YOU CREATED THIS ISSUE' Pilip, an Ethiopian Jew who fled to Israel at age 12 to escape persecution and who later enlisted and served in the Israeli military before immigrating to the United States, has linked Suozzi to Biden and blamed him for the migrant crisis. ""You know, he is the one who opened the southern border. He voted with Biden 100% of the time. He supported squad members 90% of the time, he is the one who caused the migrant crisis,"" Philip claimed in a Fox News interview on Sunday. Republican congressional candidate Mazi Pilip holds a campaign event in Franklin Square, NewYork, on Feb. 12, 2024, on the eve of a special U.S. House election in NY-03. Suozzi, a centrist and moderate Democrat, has kept his distance from Biden and his party when it comes to immigration. With Republican currently holding a fragile 219-212 majority in the House – with four vacancies – a pickup by the Democrat would put the GOP's grip on the chamber further in peril. The contest may also offer clues to how top issues like immigration and abortion will impact November's elections. ""Tom Souzzi rolled out the red carpet for illegal immigrants,"" claims a recent TV ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the main super PAC supporting House Republican. 7 Hamas attack on Israel as she aims to win voter unhappy with the far-left's criticism of the Jewish State and support for the Palestinians. But her support of Trump - who she has acknowledged she voted for in 2020 - may hurt her with moderate voter who are not fans of the former president. Suozzi - who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2022 rather than seek re-election to the House - is showcasing his support for Israel and a trip he made to the country last year. Republican congressional candidate Mazi Pilip speaks with reporters outside a polling location in Massapequa, NewYork, on Feb. 13, 2024, amid a  snowstorm during a special Congressional election in NY-03. While Suozzi, a campaign veteran, has welcomed his interactions with reporters, Pilip's public appearances have been carefully managed. The district, which includes a sliver of the outer portion of the NewYork City borough of Queens, is anchored in neighboring Nassau County. And it's the kind of suburban district where Democrat need to dominate in the 2024 elections as they aim to reclaim the House majority they lost in the 2022 midterms. But while Democrat have performed well in suburban districts in recent cycles, Republican have a history of coming out on top on NewYork's Long Island. While Biden carried the current confines of the district by eight points in his 2020 presidential election victory, Santos won the 2022 election for the open House seat by the same margin. Former Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi greets voter outside a polling location on Feb. 13, 2024 in Glen Cove, NewYork, in a special congressional election in NY-03. The final public opinion polls in the special election suggested that Souzzi was clinging to a slight single-digit edge over Pilip. Turnout is considered key in the outcome of this election. Democrat appeared to enjoy a slight edge in the nine-day early voting period, which ended on Sunday. And a winter snowstorm walloped the District on Tuesday morning, as polls opened. While the treacherous weather passed by early afternoon, it could impact Election Day voter turnout.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-senate-candidates-spar-over-dems-proposal-minimum-wage,"California Senate candidates discuss raising minimum wage to as high as $50 Three Democrat and one Republican discussed raising the minimum wage in Monday night’s Senate debate, with one Democrat being asked to defend her plan to raise it to $50. A Monday night debate in California between several candidates vying for an open Senate seat included a question about raising the minimum wage to $50, an idea that one Democrat candidate has floated. ""In the Bay Area, I believe it was the United Way that came out with a report that very recently $127,000 for a family of four is just barely enough to get by,"" Democrat Congresswoman Barbara Lee said when asked to defend her previous support of a $50 minimum wage and explain how it would be ""sustainable."" ""Another survey very recently, $104,000; for a family of one, barely enough to get by, low income because of the affordability crisis."" Lee has previously called for a $50 minimum wage, which would amount to around $104,000 per year of income. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour and ranges from $16 to $20 in California. FAST-FOOD PRICES SET TO RISE AT MCDONALD'S, CHIPOTLE AND OTHERS AS CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE HIKE LOOMS Rep. Barbara Lee ""Just do the math. Of course, we have national minimum wages that we need to raise to a living wage,"" Lee continued. ""We’re talking about $20, $25 — fine. But I have got to be focused on what California needs and what the affordability factor is when we calculate this wage."" Former baseball star Steve Garvey, the only Republican on the stage, told the moderators that the minimum wage ""is where it is and should be."" ""If you look at what California has done to fast-food franchises right now, increasing the minimum wage to $20, and what’s going to happen,"" Garvey said. ""That’s going to increase costs for hardworking Californians to go to a franchise to get a Big Mac for $9, it’s going to be $15."" LOS ANGELES DESSERT SHOP ANNOUNCES SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LOCATIONS, CITES COST OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA Rep. Adam Schiff Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff took issue with Garvey’s statement and said that so many people are living on the street because they are being paid ""poverty wages."" ""Try to find a house anywhere in California when you’re earning minimum wage,"" Schiff told Garvey. ""We have to raise people’s incomes."" SOME GOP LAWMAKERS WANT TO RAISE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE — BUT ONLY FOR VERIFIABLE AMERICAN CITIZENS California Senate candidate Steve Garvey Schiff and fellow Democrat candidate Katie Porter have floated support for minimum wages ranging from $20 to $25 per hour. California passed legislation last fall that will require a $20 per hour minimum wage at all restaurants with at least 60 locations nationwide, though the law includes an exception for restaurants that make and sell their own bread. Several major fast-food franchises, including McDonald’s and Chipotle, have already signaled that prices will have to rise in response to the increased labor costs. MOST ECONOMISTS OPPOSE THE $15 PER HOUR MINIMUM WAGE – HERE'S THE STUNNING REASON WHY As businesses consider passing costs on to consumers, Fat Brands Chair Andy Wiederhorn recently said that ""someone's got to pay"" for the jump in wages. ""The consumers who are voter must have known what they were getting into by promoting this legislation to raise the minimum wage from $15 to $20 and on its way to $25,"" Wiederhorn told Fox Business this month. ""Everyone wants their employees to make more money, but it just costs. And someone's got to pay for it. And the restaurant operators don't have the margin for that. So, prices are going to go up."" Rep. Katie Porter A 2021 Harvard Business Review study found that raising the minimum wage actually leads to lower compensation for employees. In addition to companies being forced to raise prices, many economists have also warned that companies will be forced to cut jobs, which often ends up disproportionately hurting low-wage income earners, the very group supporters of raising the minimum wage are aiming to help. ""Apologists for the minimum wage routinely claim that increasing it will help low-income workers and have no negative effects,"" E.J. Antoni, a research fellow in regional economics with the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Data Analysis, told FOX Business about raising the minimum wage last year. In reality, raising the minimum wage reduces employment and causes the higher cost of labor to be passed on to customers. Because low-income workers disproportionately buy fast food, they disproportionately bear the cost of not only the more expensive labor but also the lower employment levels."" Antoni continued, ""That fact exposes the reality that the true minimum wage is, and always has been, zero","['california', 'senate', 'candidates', 'discuss', 'raising', 'minimum', 'wage', 'high', '50', 'three', 'democrat', 'one', 'republican', 'discussed', 'raising', 'minimum', 'wage', 'monday', 'night’s', 'senate', 'debate', 'one', 'democrat', 'asked', 'defend', 'plan', 'raise', '50', 'monday', 'night', 'debate', 'california', 'several', 'candidates', 'vying', 'open', 'senate', 'seat', 'included', 'question', 'raising', 'minimum', 'wage', '50', 'idea', 'one', 'democrat', 'candidate', 'floated', 'bay', 'area', 'believe', 'united', 'way', 'came', 'report', 'recently', '127000', 'family', 'four', 'barely', 'enough', 'democrat', 'congresswoman', 'barbara', 'lee', 'asked', 'defend', 'previous', 'support', '50', 'minimum', 'wage', 'explain', 'sustainable', 'another', 'survey', 'recently', '104000', 'family', 'one', 'barely', 'enough', 'low', 'income', 'affordability', 'crisis', 'lee', 'previously', 'called', '50', 'minimum', 'wage', 'amount', 'around', '104000', 'per', 'year', 'income', 'federal', 'minimum', 'wage', '725', 'per', 'hour', 'ranges', '16', '20', 'california', 'fastfood', 'prices', 'set', 'rise', 'mcdonalds', 'chipotle', 'others', 'california', 'minimum', 'wage', 'hike', 'looms', 'rep', 'barbara', 'lee', 'math', 'course', 'national', 'minimum', 'wages', 'need', 'raise', 'living', 'wage', 'lee', 'continued', 'we’re', 'talking', '20', '25', 'fine', 'got', 'focused', 'california', 'needs', 'affordability', 'factor', 'calculate', 'wage', 'baseball', 'star', 'steve', 'garvey', 'republican', 'stage', 'moderators', 'minimum', 'wage', 'look', 'california', 'done', 'fastfood', 'franchises', 'right', 'increasing', 'minimum', 'wage', '20', 'what’s', 'going', 'happen', 'garvey', 'that’s', 'going', 'increase', 'costs', 'hardworking', 'californians', 'go', 'franchise', 'big', 'mac', '9', 'going', '15', 'los', 'angeles', 'dessert', 'shop', 'announces', 'sudden', 'closure', 'locations', 'cites', 'cost', 'business', 'california', 'rep', 'adam', 'schiff', 'democrat', 'rep', 'adam', 'schiff', 'took', 'issue', 'garvey’s', 'statement', 'many', 'people', 'living', 'street', 'paid', 'poverty', 'wages', 'try', 'find', 'house', 'anywhere', 'california', 'you’re', 'earning', 'minimum', 'wage', 'schiff', 'garvey', 'raise', 'people’s', 'incomes', 'gop', 'lawmakers', 'want', 'raise', 'federal', 'minimum', 'wage', 'verifiable', 'american', 'citizens', 'california', 'senate', 'candidate', 'steve', 'garvey', 'schiff', 'fellow', 'democrat', 'candidate', 'katie', 'porter', 'floated', 'support', 'minimum', 'wages', 'ranging', '20', '25', 'per', 'hour', 'california', 'passed', 'legislation', 'last', 'fall', 'require', '20', 'per', 'hour', 'minimum', 'wage', 'restaurants', 'least', '60', 'locations', 'nationwide', 'though', 'law', 'includes', 'exception', 'restaurants', 'make', 'sell', 'bread', 'several', 'major', 'fastfood', 'franchises', 'including', 'mcdonald’s', 'chipotle', 'already', 'signaled', 'prices', 'rise', 'response', 'increased', 'labor', 'costs', 'economists', 'oppose', '15', 'per', 'hour', 'minimum', 'wage', 'heres', 'stunning', 'reason', 'businesses', 'consider', 'passing', 'costs', 'consumers', 'fat', 'brands', 'chair', 'andy', 'wiederhorn', 'recently', 'someones', 'got', 'pay', 'jump', 'wages', 'consumers', 'voter', 'must', 'known', 'getting', 'promoting', 'legislation', 'raise', 'minimum', 'wage', '15', '20', 'way', '25', 'wiederhorn', 'business', 'month', 'everyone', 'wants', 'employees', 'make', 'money', 'costs', 'someones', 'got', 'pay', 'restaurant', 'operators', 'dont', 'margin', 'prices', 'going', 'go', 'rep', 'katie', 'porter', '2021', 'harvard', 'business', 'review', 'study', 'found', 'raising', 'minimum', 'wage', 'actually', 'leads', 'lower', 'compensation', 'employees', 'addition', 'companies', 'forced', 'raise', 'prices', 'many', 'economists', 'warned', 'companies', 'forced', 'cut', 'jobs', 'often', 'ends', 'disproportionately', 'hurting', 'lowwage', 'income', 'earners', 'group', 'supporters', 'raising', 'minimum', 'wage', 'aiming', 'help', 'apologists', 'minimum', 'wage', 'routinely', 'claim', 'increasing', 'help', 'lowincome', 'workers', 'negative', 'effects', 'ej', 'antoni', 'research', 'fellow', 'regional', 'economics', 'heritage', 'foundation’s', 'center', 'data', 'analysis', 'business', 'raising', 'minimum', 'wage', 'last', 'year', 'reality', 'raising', 'minimum', 'wage', 'reduces', 'employment', 'causes', 'higher', 'cost', 'labor', 'passed', 'customers', 'lowincome', 'workers', 'disproportionately', 'buy', 'fast', 'food', 'disproportionately', 'bear', 'cost', 'expensive', 'labor', 'lower', 'employment', 'levels', 'antoni', 'continued', 'fact', 'exposes', 'reality', 'true', 'minimum', 'wage', 'always', 'zero']"

HunterBiden’s ex-business associate Tony Bobulinski testified that Biden is ""the Big Guy"" and said the president ""continues to lie"" to the American people about his involvement in his son’s business dealings. Bobulinski, who worked with HunterBiden to create the joint-venture SinoHawk Holdings with Chinese energy company CEFC, and said he met with Biden in 2017, provided ""unshakeable"" testimony behind closed doors at the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees Tuesday. JOE Biden 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES His testimony, which came as part of the House impeachment inquiry against Biden, lasted for more than eight hours. A source familiar with his testimony told Fox News Digital that he testified that he ""personally met"" with Biden in May 2017 in Los Angeles on the sidelines of the Milken Conference for somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour. Fox News Digital first reported on that meetings between Bobulinski and Biden in October 2020. Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of HunterBiden, speaks to reporters at a hotel in Nashville, Tennessee on October 22, 2020. Biden, on May 3, 2017, spoke at the conference, hosting ""A Conversation with the 47th Vice President of the United States Biden."" Just days after the May 2, 2017, meeting, the now-infamous May 13, 2017, email, which included a discussion of ""remuneration packages"" for six people in a business deal with a Chinese energy firm . The email appeared to identify Biden as ""Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC,"" in a reference to now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co. The email includes a note that ""Hunter has some office expectations he will elaborate."" A proposed equity split references ""20"" for ""H"" and ""10 held by H for the big guy?"" with no further details. FLASHBACK: HUNTER Biden BUSINESS ASSOCIATE'S TEXT MESSAGES INDICATE MEETING WITH JOE Biden Bobulinski testified Tuesday that Biden is ""the big guy."" Bobulinski has, since 2020, said ""the big guy"" was Biden. But IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, who claimed that politics had influenced the yearslong federal investigation into HunterBiden, also said ""the big guy"" was known to be Biden. Meanwhile, Bobulinski testified that from his ""direct personal experience,"" it is ""clear"" that Biden was ""'the Brand' being sold by the Biden family.’"" ""His family’s foreign influence peddling operation—from China to Ukraine and elsewhere—sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to Biden and the United States government,"" Bobulinski said in his opening statement, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital. Joe and son HunterBiden. ""Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family’s business; he was an enabler, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability,"" Bobulinski said. ""The only reason any of these international business transactions took place—with tens of millions of dollars flowing directly to the Biden family—was because Biden was in high office."" Bobulinski added: ""The Biden family business was Biden, period."" Bobulinski served in the U.S. Navy’s Naval Nuclear Power Training Command as a decorated master training specialist instructor; the Command’s chief technology officer, holding ""Q security clearance"" from the Energy Department and from the National Security Agency; and later served as a direct input officer for the command in his final Navy Fitness Report. Another source familiar with Bobulinski’s testimony told Fox News Digital that he told committee investigators that Jim Biden, the president’s brother, was never concerned about the optics of Biden involvement in the family’s foreign business dealings, saying he could claim ""plausible deniability."" Bobulinski also told congressional lawmakers that he was never approached by the Justice Department, or Special Counsel David Weiss, to answer questions or provide testimony on anything related to the Biden. Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., arrives for the House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing titled ""Unsuitable Litigation: Oversight of Third-Party Litigation Funding"" in Rayburn Building on Wednesday, September 13, 2023. ""Tony Bobulinski articulated under oath that Biden was ‘the brand’ the Biden sold to enrich the family,"" House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer said in a statement after Bobulinski’s testimony. ""Biden not only knew about his family’s dealings with a Chinese Communist Party linked energy company, but he also enabled them and participated in them. Tony Bobulinski testified he believes Biden committed wrongdoing and continues to lie to the American people about his participation in his family’s influence peddling schemes."" BOBULINSKI OFFERED TO TESTIFY AT HUNTER Biden GRAND JURY BUT 'NEVER HEARD BACK': SOURCE Comer went on to say Bobulinski ""was unshakeable in his testimony today, providing facts Democrat didn’t want to hear."" ""As such, Democrat put on a shameful display as they yelled at Mr. Bobulinski, cut him off, belittled him, and threatened him, U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin. 21.

Bobulinski will also explain that the Biden family members ""were enriched to the tune of tens of millions of dollars from some of our most dangerous adversaries, including the Chinese Communist Party and players from Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Kazakhstan, and other foreign nations and entities."" Joe and son HunterBiden. Bobulinski is also expected to say that the Biden family ""knowingly and aggressively defrauded"" him. Meanwhile, Bobulinski is expected to say that federal law enforcement has been ""singularly unwilling to speak with me or hear the facts"" he plans to share with the committee. Bobulinski will say that he has ""never"" been contacted to testify in any federal investigation related to the Biden, including with Special Counsel David Weiss’ team. In October 2020, Bobulinski voluntarily went to the FBI’s Washington Field Office ""with several phones containing years of encrypted communications between me and numerous members of the Biden family and their associates."" EXCLUSIVE: JOE Biden ALLEGEDLY PAID $5M BY BURISMA EXECUTIVE AS PART OF A BRIBERY SCHEME, ACCORDING TO FBI DOCUMENT Bobulinski is set to begin by thanking the committee for giving him the opportunity to share the ""facts and evidence"" with the American people that he has ""been trying to outline for over four years, all backed up and supported by emails, texts, documents, records, pictures, and other evidence."" Bobulinski served in the U.S. Navy’s Naval Nuclear Power Training Command as a decorated master training specialist instructor; the Command’s chief technology officer, holding ""Q security clearance"" from the Energy Department and from the National Security Agency; and later served as a direct input officer for the command in his final Navy Fitness Report. Tony Bobulinski's Navy photo. ""I am here today out of duty to God and country in a nonpartisan manner with only one party in mind, the party I served with honor and gratitude: the United States of America,"" Bobulinski will say, maintaining that he is ""not a political person,"" while disclosing that he did make campaign contributions to Democrat, like Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., over the years. Bobulinski first came forward with his story about Biden alleged involvement in his family’s business deals weeks before the 2020 presidential election. ""For nearly four years, I have tried to tell the American people the truth about serious corruption at the very top of their government,"" Bobulinski will say, referring to the

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-met-chairman-chinese-energy-firm-hunter-did-business-2017-ex-associate-testifies,"We have ‘lots of questions’ for HunterBiden: Rep. James Comer Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., discusses HunterBiden’s upcoming appearance for his deposition on ‘Hannity.’ Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm HunterBiden sought to create a joint venture with at the Four Seasons in Washington D.C. in 2017, a former business partner of the first son told congressional investigators. Rob Walker, a former business associate of HunterBiden, testified at the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees earlier this month as part of the House impeachment inquiry against Biden. HUNTER Biden'S EX-ASSOCIATE TONY BOBULINSKI HEADS TO CAPITOL HILL THIS WEEK TO TESTIFY IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY Walker, during his closed-door transcribed interview, told congressional investigators that Biden attended a meeting where he, HunterBiden, their other business partners and CEFC Chairman Ye Jianming were having lunch. ""I don’t remember the exact time, but I remember being in Washington, D.C., and the former vice president stopped by. We were having lunch,"" Walker testified, according to a transcript of his interview reviewed by Fox News Digital. Joe and son HunterBiden. Walker said he did not know the ""exact"" date, but said ""it was 20-probably-17 at some point."" ""I can say it was for certain he was out of office,"" Walker said, referring to Biden being out of the Obama administration at the time of the lunch. HUNTER Biden WAS PAID $100K THROUGH JOINT-VENTURE WITH CHINESE ENERGY FIRM, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIED Walker said the lunch took place ""at the Four Seasons in a restaurant in a private room."" ""I’m certain—I’m certain Ye was there,"" Walker said, noting there were also other CEFC business partners. Ye Jianming, at the time, was the chairman of Chinese energy company CEFC. Walker said the purpose of the meeting was to discuss ""ways we could work together."" ""I don’t think we had structured a deal on how to work together at this point,"" Walker said, noting the meeting lasted ""probably an hour and a half,"" but said Biden ""was not"" there for the entirety of the meeting. DEVON ARCHER: HUNTER Biden, BURISMA EXECS ‘CALLED DC’ TO GET UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR FIRED ""The former vice president was not there the entire time. He was there maybe 10 minutes,"" Walker said. ""He spoke nice, you know, normal pleasantries. I think he probably did most of the talking and then left."" Walker testified that Biden addressed the entire group—which consisted of approximately 10 CEFC-linked individuals— during his visit. Biden speaks during a meeting of the National Infrastructure Advisory Council in the Indian Treaty Room of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2023. Walker testified that the visit, and Biden appearance, ""likely"" took place before his Robinson Walker LLC received $3 million from State Energy HK Limited—a CEFC-linked entity. But Walker maintained that Biden was not involved in any of his business ventures with HunterBiden, despite his appearance at the lunch. Walker did, however, say that early correspondence to CEFC was sent on behalf of the group—which included himself, James Gilliar, Jim Biden, and HunterBiden—by HunterBiden. FLASHBACK: HUNTER Biden BUSINESS ASSOCIATE'S TEXT MESSAGES INDICATE MEETING WITH JOE Biden ""He had an interesting last name that would probably get people in the door,"" Walker said. When pressed again as to why correspondence came from HunterBiden, Walker testified: ""It had just seemed—if a U.S. entity was going to have a foreign national represent them, It would probably make more sense to come from Hunter versus me."" ""Because he’s the son of the vice president at the time, correct?"" Walker was asked. ""He is the son of a vice president at the time, yes,"" Walker replied. ""So it made more sense to get this business deal to put him as the front-facing person, right?"" Walker replied: ""Yes."" HunterBiden, son of U.S. Biden, departs a House Oversight Committee meeting at Capitol Hill on January 10, 2024, in Washington, DC. The House Oversight Committee told Fox News Digital that it can ""now confirm Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son, including Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina, Romanian oligarch Kenes Rakishev, Burisma’s corporate secretary Vadym Pozharsky, Jonathan Li of BHR, and CEFC Chairman Ye Jianming."" Biden attended dinners at Washington D.C. restaurant Cafe Milano in Georgtown with Baturina, Rakishev and Pozharsky in 2014 and 2015. Biden also met with Li of BHR in China in 2013. Biden met with Ye at the meeting in 2017, according to testimony from HunterBiden's ex-business partners Rob Walker and Devon Archer. JOE Biden RECEIVED $40K IN 'LAUNDERED CHINA MONEY' FROM BROTHER IN 2017, COMER SAYS The revelations come ahead of highly-anticipated testimony from another ex-business associate of the first son--Tony Bobulinski. Bobulinski is set to testify behind closed doors Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. at the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees. Bobulinski, who worked with HunterBiden to create the joint-venture SinoHawk Holdings with Chinese energy company CEFC, said he met with Biden in 2017. Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of HunterBiden, speaks to reporters at a hotel in Nashville, Tennessee on October 22, 2020. Bobulinski, in December, demanded Biden ""stop lying"" about that meeting and called on him to ""correct the record."" ""Why is Biden blatantly lying to the American people and the world by claiming that he did not meet with me face to face?"" Bobulinski told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""He should call his son Hunter and brother Jim as they can remind him of the facts. The American people deserve the truth!"" HUNTER DEMANDED $10M FROM CHINESE ENERGY FIRM BECAUSE 'BIDENS ARE THE BEST,' HAVE 'CONNECTIONS' He added: ""I call on Mr. Biden to stop lying and correct the record."" Despite Biden recent denials of involvement with his son’s business dealings, text messages dating back to May 2017 reveal that Biden met with Bobulinski months after he left the vice president's office. Fox News Digital first reported on the text messages and that meeting in October 2020. The meeting on May 2, 2017, would have taken place just 11 days before the now-infamous May 13, 2017, email, which included a discussion of ""remuneration packages"" for six people in a business deal with a Chinese energy firm. The email appeared to identify Biden as ""Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC,"" in a reference to now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co. Bobulinski has repeatedly said ""the big guy"" was Biden. IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, who claimed that politics had influenced the years-long federal investigation into HunterBiden, also said ""the big guy"" was known to be Biden. The president's brother, Jim Biden, is expected to testify on Feb. 21. HunterBiden is expected to appear for his deposition on Feb. 28","['‘lots', 'questions’', 'hunterbiden', 'rep', 'james', 'comer', 'rep', 'james', 'comer', 'rky', 'discusses', 'hunterbiden’s',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/users-manual-whats-next-now-that-house-impeached-mayorkas,"DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says he won’t resign if impeached Republican were forced to shelve the priority after dissensions from a few GOP lawmakers. The House has now impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Think of impeachment as an indictment. It’s up to the Senate to act as a ""court"" and judge whether the accused is guilty of the charges in a trial. The impeachment of cabinet officials is rare. The House has now impeached multiple Presidents and federal judges. But only one cabinet secretary prior to Mayorkas. That was Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. Don’t expect anything to start until late February or early March. The House will send the articles of impeachment plus the House ""managers"" over to the Senate to formally begin the trial. SENATE APPROVES $95 BILLION FOREIGN AID BILL ""Impeachment managers"" are House members who serve as prosecutors. They present the findings of the House before the Senate . Senators sit as jurors. There is a bit of a ceremony to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate from the House and for the Senate to receive the articles. In this case, Acting Clerk of the House Kevin McCumber and House Sergeant at Arms William McFarland escort the articles of impeachment and House managers across the Capitol Rotunda to the Senate. The Senate gathers, usually with all senators sitting at their desks. Senate Sergeant at Arms Karen Gibson then receives the House entourage at the Senate door and reads the following proclamation to the Senate. ""All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas."" The articles are then presented to the Senate and the managers are introduced. That is all they usually do on the first day of a Senate trial– although FOX was told the Senate might try to squeeze everything into one day. Biden’S EXPORT SUSPENSION ON LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS COULD SPIKE YOUR HEAT BILL Under Senate impeachment trial rule III, the body is supposed to wait until the next day to swear-in senators as jurors. But FOX is told that could happen on day one in this instance. According to Senate rules, the trial must begin the day after the Senate receives the articles at 1 pm in the afternoon. Trials are supposed to run Monday through Saturday. We had Saturday sessions in both impeachment trials of former Trump in 2020 and 2021. Conway, SC - February 10 : Republican presidential candidate and former Trump walks out to speak at a speaks at a Get Out The Vote campaign rally held at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, SC on Saturday, Feb 10, 2024. It is unlikely that U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts presides over a possible Mayorkas trial. Senate impeachment rule IV requires the Chief Justice to preside over cases involving the President or Vice President. In this case, it’s likely that Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray presides over a Mayorkas tribunal. Now we get to perhaps the most interesting question of all. How much of a trial is there? The Senate cannot immediately bypass a trial. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has announced that Mayorkas' trial will begin later in February. The House has named its 11 impeachment managers. Senators will be sworn in as the jury. Senators can decide to hold a full trial, or potentially, move to dismiss or actually have straight, up or down vote on convicting or exonerating Mayorkas. The Senate could also send the articles to a committee for review. SHOOTING BLANKS: HOW REPUBLICANS MISFIRED WHEN THEY TRIED TO IMPEACH MAYORKAS In the 1998 impeachment trial of former President Clinton, late Sen. Robert Byrd made a motion to dismiss the charges. WASHINGTON -- DECEMBER 19: President Bill Clinton reacts to being impeached by the House of Representatives outside of the oval office in the White House Rose Garden, Washington, DC, December 19, 1998., Chief of Staff John Podesta, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. There will eventually be either a vote to convict/exonerate Mayorkas or dismiss the charges. Senate Republican will watch very closely if Senate Democrat engineer any vote to short-circuit the trial. The GOP will take note of how multiple vulnerable Democrat facing competitive re-election bids in battleground districts vote. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If they vote to end the trial or clear Mayorkas, Republican will likely enroll that into their campaigns against those Democrat senators. Keep in mind that FOX polling data revealed that border security was the number one issue facing voter in Iowa and New Hampshire. Republican will examine the trial-related vote of Sens. Sherrod Brown, Jon Tester, Bob Casey, Tammy Baldwin, Jacky Rosen and Kyrsten Sinema – if she runs. But the Senate must at least entertain the articles for a day or two – and then render some sort of judgment.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-impeachment-vote-house-representatives,"Mayorkas facing second impeachment vote as border crisis rages Clinton County, N.Y. Sheriff David Favro joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how the migrant crisis has impacted the northern border as Mayorkas faces another impeachment vote. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has been impeached by the House of Representatives. A Cabinet secretary has not been impeached by the U.S. Congress since 1876. The office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Mayorkas' impeachment trial will begin later this month. ""The House impeachment managers will present the articles of impeachment to the Senate following the state work period,"" Schumer's office said in a statement. ""Senators will be sworn in as jurors in the trial the next day. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray will preside."" Tuesday evening’s vote marked House Republican’ second attempt at impeaching Mayorkas. GOP lawmakers targeted the Biden official over the ongoing migrant crisis at the U.S. border, accusing him of deliberately flaunting existing immigration law and worsening the situation. DENVER SCHOOLS OVERWHELMED BY MIGRANT SURGE AS MAYOR SLASHES $5M FROM PUBLIC SERVICES TO ADDRESS CRISIS U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas was the subject of two House GOP-led impeachment vote. The 214-213 vote was always expected to be tight; Mayorkas narrowly escaped impeachment last week when every single House Democrat showed up to shield him, including Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who temporarily left the hospital where he was recovering from surgery to cast his vote. Three Republican also voted down the effort – Reps. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., Ken Buck, R-Colo., and Tom McClintock, R-Calif. HOUSE FAILS TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS IN MAJOR BLOW TO GOP Each criticized Mayorkas’ handling of the border but had reservations over whether it rose to the level of impeachment. McClintock warned it could set a precedent for political impeachments that could harm GOP officials in the future. ""Swapping one leftist for another is a fantasy, solves nothing, excuses Biden culpability, and unconstitutionally expands impeachment that someday will bite Republican,"" McClintock said last week. House China select committee Chairman Mike Gallagher was among the Republican who voted against impeachment last week. However, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., dismissed any concerns about precedent in comments to reporters hours before the vote on Tuesday. ""Mayorkas is an exceptional case in U.S. history,"" Johnson said, accusing him of having done more ""damage on the country than any Cabinet secretary that's ever been."" He also addressed the very likely scenario that the impeachment would go nowhere in the Democrat-held Senate. HERE ARE THE 3 HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO TORPEDOED MAYORKAS’ IMPEACHMENT VOTE ""The House has a constitutional responsibility, as I've said many times. It's probably the heaviest next to a declaration of war. And we have to do our job regardless of what the other chamber does,"" Johnson said. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has made the border a marquee issue for his tenure leading the House. Two impeachment articles were approved against Mayorkas by the House Homeland Security Committee. One accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and the other of having violated ""public trust."" The Department of Homeland Security criticized House Republican for holding a second Mayorkas impeachment vote on Tuesday, citing comments by GOP lawmakers who have called the effort a waste of time. OVER 40 LAWMAKERS SIGN BRIEF TO SUPPORT TEXAS IN IMMIGRATION FIGHT WITH Biden ADMINISTRATION ""House Republican’ baseless push to impeach Secretary Mayorkas has already failed once, with bipartisan opposition. If Members of Congress care about our national security, they should listen to their fellow Republican and stop wasting time on this pointless, unconstitutional impeachment – time that could be spent addressing the issue by advancing bipartisan legislation to fix our broken immigration laws and provide needed resources for border security,"" the department said. A DHS spokesperson said House Republican ""will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution for political gain rather than working to solve the serious challenges at our border."" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is expected to face a House impeachment vote. ""While Secretary Mayorkas was helping a group of Republican and Democrat Senators develop bipartisan solutions to strengthen border security and get needed resources for enforcement, House Republican have wasted months with this baseless, unconstitutional impeachment,"" the spokesperson said. ""Without a shred of evidence or legitimate Constitutional grounds, and despite bipartisan opposition, House Republican have falsely smeared a dedicated public servant who has spent more than 20 years enforcing our laws and serving our country. Secretary Mayorkas and the Department of Homeland Security will continue working every day to keep Americans safe."" Biden said, ""history will not look kindly on House Republican for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games."" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""This impeachment already failed on a bipartisan vote. Instead of staging political stunts like this, Republican with genuine concerns about the border should want Congress to deliver more border resources and stronger border security.""

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-faces-existential-moment-95-billion-foreign-aid-bill-dem-representative,"Congress faces ‘existential moment’ over $95B foreign aid bill The Senate’s $95 billion foreign aid package is drawing fierce opposition from Republican, but Democrat in the House tell Fox News the hefty price tag is necessary. WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate's $95 billion foreign aid package faces an uphill slog against House Republican, but their Democrat counterparts say it's crucial for maintaining global democracy. ""We are at an existential moment right now for global democracy and either the United States stands up for freedom and democracy around the world or we don't, and we recede back into the netherworld and allow autocrats, dictators, terrorists to take over the world,"" Rep. Dan Goldman , a Democrat from NewYork, told Fox News on Tuesday. Rep. Dan Goldman, a Democrat from NewYork, said the House needs to pass a sweeping foreign aid package in order to preserve global democracy and stand up to Iran, Russia and China. Republican have already launched a fiery opposition to the aid package. RANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON 'ROUTE' FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS A bipartisan group of senators passed the national security supplemental package after a lengthy overnight session that ended early Tuesday. The final vote was 70-29. The hefty foreign aid package comes as the national debt exceeds $34.2 trillion . It includes billions for Ukraine, Israel and other foreign partners, but omits any border security provisions, something Republican have fought for since the White House originally requested the supplemental funding package in October. Video WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE Republican also helped kill an earlier version of the bill , which paired foreign aid with increased border staffing, speedier deportations when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average and other measures. ""Border security was part of the package that essentially was vetoed by the fourth branch of government, Trump, who ordered Speaker Johnson and the MAGA elements both in the House and Senate to kill it,"" Rep. Jamie Raskin told Fox News. Had Republican ""really wanted that to be part of it and weren't just rhetorical, they would have adopted what the Senate was doing last week,"" the Maryland Democrat added. House Republican object to the Senate's massive foreign aid package, which doesn't include any spending cuts to offset the $95 billion price tag. Republican have also lobbied for the inclusion of border security and immigration measures, but led the charge against an earlier version of the bill that offered work permits to asylum recipients and set a threshold for 5,000 daily border crossings before an expedited deportation process would kick in. ‘HE’S DELUSIONAL': Biden'S BORDER COMMENTS SPARK STIFF REBUKE ON CAPITOL HILL FROM SOME LAWMAKERS But Republican like Rep. Gary Palmer from Alabama said they oppose the 5,000 a day border crossing threshold. ""What they're trying to do is give us a border package that will allow people to continue to come into the country at a rate that, frankly, during the Obama administration, the secretary of Homeland Security said was unsustainable,"" Palmer said. ""Makes no sense."" Customs and Border Protection sources told Fox News there were more than 12,000 migrant encounters on a single day in December, a new record. The surge of migrants has long overwhelmed border towns and is now putting a strain on cities across the nation . House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized the funding package as ""silent on the most pressing issue facing our country."" ""Now, in the absence of having received any single border policy change from the Senate, the House will have to continue to work its own will on these important matters,"" Johnson said in a statement late Monday. ""America deserves better than the Senate’s status quo."" Raskin suggested Democrat could use a discharge petition to bypass Johnson and bring the package to a House vote if necessary. The Senate's foreign aid package includes an additional $60 billion to help Kyiv fight off Russian aggression, plus $9 billion in aid for civilians in conflict areas such as Ukraine and Gaza. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Goldman said the package is meant to address three adversaries the U.S. has who are ""increasingly aligning themselves"" — Iran, Russia and China. The aid package allocates $60 billion in additional funding for Ukraine , which would bring the United States' total contribution to the country's fight against Russian aggression to more than $170 billion since February 2022. It also includes $14 billion for Israel's fight against Hamas , nearly $5 billion for allies in the Indo-Pacific region and $9 billion in humanitarian aid for civilians in Ukraine, Gaza and the West Bank.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/secretary-austin-to-be-released-hospital-after-treatment-bladder-issue,"Sec. Lloyd Austin in ‘good condition’ after non-surgical procedure Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports that Biden was told about Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s hospital stay, unlike his first hospital visit this year. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Tuesday after undergoing treatment for a bladder issue, according to the Pentagon . Austin, 70, had been having ongoing health issues since undergoing surgery in December to treat prostate cancer. He was taken back to Walter Reed over the weekend for a bladder issue and admitted to intensive care for the second time since the surgery. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin listens listens during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the Pentagon in Washington, Monday, Jan. 29, 2024. Austin underwent nonsurgical procedures Monday under general anesthesia to address the bladder issue, and his doctors had said they did not anticipate he would be in the hospital this time for a prolonged period. Austin was hospitalized for two weeks at Walter Reed last month after he experienced complications from the surgery. WHITE HOUSE PROMOTES KIRBY TO EXPANDED ROLE TO COORDINATE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Tuesday the bladder issue was not related to Austin's prostate cancer, but wouldn’t say whether it was a further complication from his December surgery. The Pentagon said Austin resumed his full functions and duties hours after his hospital release. ""On the advice of his doctors, Secretary Austin will recuperate and perform his duties remotely from home for a period before returning to work at the Pentagon later this week,"" a spokesperson said. ""He has full access to the unclassified and classified communications systems necessary to perform his duties.""

Senate Democrat are celebrating a hard-fought win on Tuesday after passing a $95 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that Biden had requested for months, but House GOP leaders are signaling that the victory could be short-lived. ""Right now, the Senate is the birthplace of poor policy. The lack of serious border security measures in this foreign aid package shows how disconnected this bill is from reality,"" Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer, R-Ala., the No. 5 House Republican, told Fox News Digital. ""The Senate has ignored the House of Representatives and the will of the American people this entire Congress. The American people… want the southern border secure."" Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., meanwhile, warned that the House would not simply ""rubber stamp"" whatever Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., presented and said any aid package ""must secure our own borders"" as well. ""Americans elected our majority with a mandate to get Biden border crisis under control, and we will not abandon that directive to rubber stamp a foreign aid package that the Schumer Senate rammed through overnight,"" Emmer told Fox News Digital. PENTAGON RUNS OUT OF MONEY FOR UKRAINE, URGES 50 ALLIES TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING KYIV Speaker Mike Johnson is signaling that House Republican are not going to take up Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's foreign aid bill as is. Twenty-two Senate Republican joined all but three leftist lawmakers to pass the supplemental aid bill after debating it through the night. But even before it passed early on Tuesday morning, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., signaled it may not even get a vote in his chamber. ""The mandate of national security supplemental legislation was to secure America’s own border before sending additional foreign aid around the world. It is what the American people demand and deserve,"" Johnson said in a Monday night statement. ""Now, in the absence of having received any single border policy change from the Senate, the House will have to continue to work its own will on these important matters."" U.S. NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER: SEE WHAT AMERICAN TAXPAYERS OWE IN REAL TIME A source close to Johnson confirmed to Fox News Digital the speaker does not intend to put the package up for a vote in the House, at least ""not in its current form."" Meanwhile, the GOP senators leading opposition to the bill already began re-calibrating their focus on pressuring the House not to act even before it passed the Senate. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., spoke on X Spaces on Monday evening with X owner Elon Musk, former 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, and fellow supplemental aid critic Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, where Johnson conceded the package was likely to pass. Rep. Gary Palmer suggested to Fox News Digital that he's opposed to the Senate supplemental aid bill. ""We can get to the House, get them to stop this,"" he added. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, responded to Johnson’s statement on the bill with his own brief reaction, ""This is good. We gotta hold the line."" The Senate bill came together quickly after an earlier version, a $118 billion aid package that also included border and immigration reforms, fell apart despite months of sensitive bipartisan negotiations. SENATE REPUBLICANS PREPARE FOR LONG HAUL IN FIGHT OVER UKRAINE, ISRAEL AID Republican in the House and Senate had closed ranks and demanded the Biden administration do something about the border crisis before they could support aid to Ukraine, which has become an increasingly polarizing issue within the GOP. But key Republican leaders lambasted the deal soon after it came out, claiming it did not go far enough to stop the flow of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson led House Republican in insisting that only an executive order by Biden could fix the crisis. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said the GOP would not just ""rubber stamp"" whatever the Senate sent over. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, urged Johnson to let the House vote on the Senate’s bill in his own statement Tuesday. He also accused Republican of kowtowing to former Trump, who had publicly urged them to oppose the Senate’s bipartisan deal. ""Speaker Johnson, I was with you in the White House, one day after taking the gavel, when you said we would pass an aid package for our allies. If your words mean anything, let the House vote."" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., vowed to use ""every available legislative tool"" to get the bill passed. ""All options are on the table,"" Jeffries said. ""And what is clear is that there are more than 300 bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives to pass the national security bill today.""

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre revealed Tuesday that it was Biden’s idea to hold what has since become a widely criticized press conference following the release of Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report on his handling of classified documents. Jean-Pierre, speaking at the White House press briefing, said ""it was the president’s idea"" to appear last Thursday in front of the media to defend himself from the findings in Hur’s report, which described the 81-year-old as a ""sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory."" During the barrage of questions, Biden at one point raised his voice at a reporter and later made a gaffe by referring to Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi as the ""president of Mexico."" ""He wanted to, it was his idea,"" Jean-Pierre said when asked Tuesday about how the unexpected event came to be. She then deflected when a reporter asked ""did anyone advise him against it?"" Biden BLISTERED BY MAINSTREAM MEDIA AFTER ‘DISASTER’ PRESS CONFERENCE Biden speaks in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House on Thursday, Feb. 8, in Washington, D.C., following the release of Hur's report. ""I'm not going to get into private conversations that the president has. The president is the president of the United States,"" Jean-Pierre shot back. ""If he says he wants to speak to directly to the American people, he's going to do that."" She also said Tuesday that the White House counsel is looking into the public release of the transcripts of Biden conversations with Hur. Biden LASHES OUT AT REPORTERS ASKING ABOUT AGE CONCERNS AFTER SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday that it was Biden's idea to hold a press conference following the release last Thursday of the findings of Special Counsel Robert Hur. At the press conference last week, Biden appeared visibly angered when responding to claims in Hur's report that Biden did not remember when his son Beau died. Hur, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Biden's handling of classified documents, concluded he would not bring charges against him in part because a jury would find him to be a ""sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory,"" despite the acknowledgment that the documents were ""willfully"" obtained by Biden both as vice president and as a senator.

The House Judiciary Committee is in talks to have Special Counsel Robert Hur potentially testify on Capitol Hill after releasing his report on Biden’s handling of classified documents, Fox News Digital has learned. Two sources told Fox News Digital that House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan’s committee is looking at late February or early March for possible dates for Hur to testify. House Republican appear poised for a lengthy probe into Hur’s findings after he released a 388-page report clearing Biden of wrongdoing despite having ""willfully retained and disclosed classified materials."" SPECIAL COUNSEL CALLS Biden 'SYMPATHETIC, WELL-MEANING, ELDERLY MAN WITH A POOR MEMORY,' BRINGS NO CHARGES House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, left, is looking for Special Counsel Robert Hur, right, to testify about his investigation into Biden, center. Hur said Biden came off ""as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"" and that ""it would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him-by then a former president well into his eighties-of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness."" Republican lawmakers have argued that Hur’s decision not to recommend charges against Biden is an example of the two-tiered justice system in the U.S. It’s also spurred speculation over whether the 81-year-old president is unfit for office. Jordan, R-Ohio, along with House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., and House Ways & Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday calling for him to release the transcripts and recordings of Biden interview with the special counsel’s office.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-garners-67k-tiktok-followers-first-day-using-chinese-owned-app-he-banned-security-concerns,"It's very awkward to watch Biden try to engage on TikTok: Roma Daravi 'Fox News @ Night' panelists Lee Carter and Roma Daravi discuss Biden's campaign joining TikTok. Biden's new campaign account garnered more than 67,000 TikTok followers in the first day since joining the Chinese-owned app he banned over national security concerns. The @bidenhq account's following had jumped even higher to nearly 82,000 followers as of Tuesday morning, with more than 681,300 likes. That's still a far cry from Biden's 37.8 million followers on his campaign account on X, formerly Twitter. ""Lol hey guys,"" the first TikTok video on the account, published during the Super Bowl game Sunday, read in the caption. Biden, in khaki slacks and a navy sweater, stood with his hands in his pockets as he was asked a series of questions. Asked ""Chiefs or Niners?,"" Biden responded, ""Two great quarterbacks, hard to decide, but if I didn’t say I was for the Eagles, then I’d be sleeping alone. My wife’s a Philly girl."" When challenged on if he preferred the game or commercials or the game or the halftime show, Biden responded game twice.

""Jason Kelce or Travis Kelce?"" someone questioned from behind the camera. ""Mama Kelce. I understand she makes great chocolate chip cookies,"" Biden said. ""Deviously plotting to rig the season so the Chiefs would make the Super Bowl? Or are the Chiefs just being a good football team?"" the voice asked again. ""I’d get in trouble if I told you,"" Biden responded, as the video cuts briefly to the Dark Brandon meme. ""Trump or Biden?"" he's asked, as the screen shows a side by side of Trump, a bit sunburned, in a Make America Great Again hat and polo, next to Biden seen smiling and wearing a suit in his official headshot. ""Are you kidding?"" the president chuckles, concluding the video. ""Biden."" Biden's reelection campaign on Monday defended its new TikTok account as a vital way to boost its appeal with young voter, even as his administration continued to raise security concerns about whether the popular social media app might be sharing user data with China’s communist government. Biden in 2022 signed legislation banning the use of TikTok by the federal government’s nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes. With 150 million U.S. users, TikTok is best known for quick snippets of viral dance routines. But Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., posted on X that Biden campaign is ""bragging about using a Chinese spy app even though Biden signed a law banning it on all federal devices."" ""The President’s TikTok debut last night — with more than 5 million views and counting — is proof positive of both our commitment and success in finding new, innovative ways to reach voter in an evolving, fragmented, and increasingly personalized media environment,"" Biden reelection deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty said in a statement Monday. The Biden campaign said it had been mulling establishing a TikTok account for months and had ultimately done so at the urging of youth activists and organizations, who argued that the app was key to reaching young voter. The campaign said it is using a separate cellphone to engage on TikTok in order to isolate using the app from other workstreams and communications, including emails. The campaign said it was taking additional steps but declined to name them, citing security concerns. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, left, calls on a reporter for White House national security communications adviser John Kirby, right, during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, Monday, Feb. 12, 2024. BIG TECH FACES BRUTAL QUESTIONING ON CAPITOL HILL OVER CONTENT HARMING KIDS At the White House, though, national security spokesman John Kirby acknowledged that ""there are still national security concerns about the use of TikTok on government devices and there’s been no change to our policy not to allow that."" Kirby referred most questions about TikTok to the Biden campaign and ducked a more general query about whether it was wise to use the app at all. He said the potential security issues ""have to do with concerns about the preservation of data and potential misuse of that data and privacy information by foreign actors."" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she is not in contact with the campaign and had no advance warning that its TikTok account was going live. Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, could share user data — such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers — with that country's authoritarian government. Separately, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has been reviewing the app for years while trying unsuccessfully to force TikTok ownership to divest from its parent company. The White House said Monday the review is ongoing. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testifies during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Jan. 31, 2024, on child safety. Another three videos had been added to Biden TikTok by Tuesday morning. ""Weird brag,"" one was captioned, including clips of former Trump championing the SupremeCourt’s overturning of Roe v. Wade.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-age-old-question,"Welcome to Fox News’ Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail. What's Happening? - Ex-HunterBiden associate testifies to House panel - House prepares to vote on Biden border chief impeachment - NewYork's 3rd district voting on a replacement for ex-Rep George Santos Who could step up? Democrat have overwhelmingly backed Biden's 2024 re-election. But the damaging report released last week by Special Counsel Robert Hur has breathed new life into the belief that the party will ultimately replace him as nominee ahead of the 2024 general election. From left to right: California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former First Lady Michelle Obama, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, and Vice President Kamala Harris. Here are five of the top names being mentioned as a potential replacement for Biden should he decide — or is pressured — not to run for a second term: 1. California Gov. Gavin Newsom Democrat strategists and members of the media continually mention him as a future presidential hopeful, but that future could come sooner rather than later should Biden's plans change. 2. Vice President Harris Harris' presidential ambitions have been known since her first unsuccessful run for the White House in 2020, when she failed to gain support over her Democrat primary opponents, including Biden. Despite her low approval rating and frequent gaffes as vice president, she continues to insist she's ""ready to serve"" as commander in chief, if necessary. 3. Former first lady Michelle Obama Obama has been one of the more surprising names floated as a potential replacement for Biden, considering her lack of political experience. But she remains popular to Democrat, and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy keeps floating the possibility. 4. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Despite declining a run for the White House , Whitmer appeared to leave the door open for a future presidential run after her convincing re-election win during the 2022 midterm elections, a year that was expected to be a difficult one for Democrat. 5. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear Beshear has been seen as a rising star within the party given his status as one of the most popular governors in the country, despite being a Democrat leading a red state. That status grew following a big re-election win last year over then-Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who was considered a rising GOP star.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nato-comments-trigger-fierce-media-european-opposition-how-serious-he,"The media doesn’t allow the public to hear what Trump has to say: Robby Soave Reason senior editor Robby Soave and Democrat strategist Ameshia Cross join ‘MediaBuzz’ to discuss the SupremeCourt appearing to tilt towards Trump in the Colorado ballot case. Trump has made some news that is reverberating around the world. It wasn’t him saying – after that incredible Super Bowl comeback by Kansas City – that he signed a law boosting earnings for musicians so Taylor Swift shouldn’t endorse Biden. It wasn’t ""we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country, we will rout the Fake News Media, we will Drain the Swamp."" It’s not that he told a SouthCarolina rally that "" Biden's thugs are still trying to put me in jail on fake charges for crimes that they openly admit that Crooked Joe did. He actually did these crimes"" – while adding ""I’m not looking for anything to happen to this guy."" WHY Biden’S ANGER AND DEFENSIVENESS INFLAMED ANXIETY ABOUT HIS MEMORY ISSUES No, it’s about NATO. Trump recalled a conversation with the president ""of a big country,"" who he says asked him if they didn’t increase their defense contribution to the North Atlantic alliance ""and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?"" Sharing his response at the rally, Trump claims he said: ""You didn’t pay. You’re delinquent… No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want."" The idea that Vladimir Putin could do ""whatever the hell they want"" set off alarm bells, not only among foreign policy officials in Europe but in much of the mainstream media here at home. One potential impact would be on Ukraine, with Trump having declined to endorse more military aid to that weakened country, which would allow Russia’s unprovoked invasion to succeed in either keeping its territorial gains along the eastern border or capturing the entire sovereign nation. And yet there is further evidence, as if any were needed, that the GOP is now Trump party. Some of the biggest Republican hawks, who staunchly supported NATO in the past, say they have no problem with the former president’s remarks. Republican presidential candidate and former Trump during a Get Out The Vote rally at Coastal Carolina University on Feb. 10 in Conway, SouthCarolina. As the Washington Post points out, Lindsey Graham said when he ran for president in 2016 that Trump comments had made Putin a ""very happy man."" On Sunday, the senator said he was ""not worried"" about Trump latest remarks ""at all."" Tom Cotton, another leading hawk, said in 2016 that America must ""make sure that we stand by NATO and we stand for countries like Ukraine and Georgia"" who face ""Russian aggression, and recognize Vladimir Putin as the adversary he is."" On Sunday, the senator said NATO countries not paying their full share are ""already encouraging Russian aggression, and Trump is simply ringing the warning bell."" UKRAINE AID PACKAGE WOULD BE USED TO IMPEACH Trump, SEN VANCE WARNS Marco Rubio said in 2018 that Trump went too far by ""questioning the value of the alliance,"" tweeting: ""The end of #NATO would be a dream come true for #Putin."" On Sunday, the senator said he had ""zero"" concerns about Trump latest comments and suggested he didn’t mean them: ""We’ve already been through this. ""You would think people would’ve figured it out by now."" And here’s the kicker: Rubio and Graham pushed through a bill barring any president from withdrawing from NATO. I wonder who they might have had in mind? Republican presidential candidate and former Trump walks out to speak at a Get Out The Vote campaign rally held at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, SouthCarolina, on Feb 10. Look, I get it. This is how Trump negotiates. During his first term he regularly questioned the value of the NATO alliance as a way of getting some country to keep their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, with some success. It’s an approach he honed as a businessman when he would threaten to walk away from a deal unless certain conditions were met. But when Trump took office with little experience in foreign policy, he was talked out of any withdrawal by such retired generals as Jim Mattis and John Kelly. The NewYork Times reports this anecdote: ""Soon after former President Donald J. Trump took office, his staff explained how NATO’s mutual defense obligations worked. ""‘You mean, if Russia attacked Lithuania, we would go to war with Russia?’ he responded. ‘That’s crazy.’ Mr. Trump has never believed in the fundamental one-for-all-and-all-for-one concept of the Atlantic alliance."" But Trump has made clear that in a second term he would surround himself with loyalists who would not attempt to stop such decisions. Senior adviser Jason Miller says Biden has reversed Trump approach to NATO: ""Democrat and media pearl-clutchers seem to have forgotten that we had four years of peace and prosperity under Trump, but Europe saw death and destruction under Obama-Biden and now more death and destruction under Biden."" FINLAND CENTER-RIGHT CANDIDATE ALEXANDER STUBB DECLARES PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY WITH NEARLY 52% OF VOTE Much of the media are leading the charge on NATO. CNN’s Christiane Amanpour called Trump latest comments ""insane."" It’s also true that top European officials are being quoted on the record as criticizing Trump language. They would be irresponsible if they didn’t start plotting a Plan B. European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 28, 2022. The crux of the argument is that the alliance created in the wake of World War II has worked well in deterring war and doesn’t need to be fixed. I happen to be in that camp – and the only time the mutual defense pact has been invoked was when our allies aided us after the Sept. 11 attacks. Footnote: Trump now says on Truth Social that ""NO MONEY IN THE FORM OF FOREIGN AID SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ANY COUNTRY UNLESS IT IS DONE AS A LOAN, NOT JUST A GIVEAWAY.""

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/house-intel-chairman-serious-national-security-threat/index.html,"The US has new intelligence on Russian military capabilities related to its efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space, according to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence. The intelligence was briefed to Congress and key US allies, and some lawmakers say it is serious enough that it should be declassified and made public. While the intelligence is concerning, multiple senior members of Congress briefed on the information on Wednesday emphasized that it does not pose an immediate threat to the US or its interests. The system remains under development and is not yet in orbit, according to three US officials familiar with the intelligence. It’s not clear how far the technology has progressed, one of the officials said. A separate US official told CNN the threat does not involve a weapon that would be used to attack humans. It was not immediately clear whether the intelligence referred to a nuclear-powered, anti-satellite capability or a nuclear-armed capability. While members of Congress downplayed the immediacy of the threat, an anti-satellite weapon placed in orbit around Earth would pose a significant danger to US nuclear command and control satellites, said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. The US relies on such satellites – which he called “essential” – to ensure constant, seamless control over its nuclear arsenal. Other countries have tested anti-satellite weapons in the past, but this would be an escalation, Kristensen said, and the US has made clear that it would react “very forcefully” to an attack on its nuclear command and control satellites. “If it’s orbital, it’s a new level of threat [to the system], whether it’s nuclear or not,” said Kristensen, who added that even conventional weapons on an orbital anti-satellite system could pose a significant threat to the US. ABC News first reported that the intelligence related to a Russian space-based nuclear capability. Earlier Wednesday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, ignited a firestorm on Capitol Hill when he issued a cryptic statement announcing that the panel had “information concerning a serious national security threat.” In a letter to lawmakers inviting them to view the intelligence in the committee’s classified spaces, he said that it related to a “destabilizing foreign military capability that should be known by all congressional policymakers.” Immediately, lawmakers began tramping down to the House basement to learn what the intelligence was. Some left underwhelmed. One Democrat member with deep national security experience said that they had never before received that kind of urgent summons over a national security matter during their time in Congress — and that the intelligence they saw when they arrived was not urgent enough to justify Turner’s alarm-pulling. Within hours, the Republican speaker of the House, Rep. Mike Johnson, attempted to tamp down the imbroglio, telling reporters that “there is no cause for alarm” and indicating that he had known about the intelligence since at least January. “We just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We’re working on it and there’s no need for alarm,” Johnson said. Rep. Jim Himes, the committee’s top Democrat, said in a statement that “the classified intelligence product that the House Intelligence Committee called to the attention of Members last night is a significant one, but it is not a cause for panic.” National security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday said he was “surprised” that Turner had made the existence of the intelligence public, noting that he was already scheduled to brief the top Republican and Democrat leaders of the House as well as Turner and Himes on Thursday. “We scheduled a briefing for the House members of the Gang of Eight tomorrow,” Sullivan said. “That’s been on the books. So I am a bit surprised that Congressman Turner came out publicly today in advance of a meeting on the books for me to go sit with him alongside our intelligence and defense professionals tomorrow.” Turner in his statement has urged the Biden administration to declassify “all information relating to this threat so that Congress, the Administration, and our allies can openly discuss the actions necessary to respond to this threat.” Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Republican and Democrat leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee suggested that they had been tracking the intelligence but that it would be difficult to declassify it without exposing sensitive sources and methods. The uproar over the new intelligence comes as a $60 billion aid package to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia has stalled in the House and former Trump has been publicly supporting GOP members who have opposed the package. Trump has also in recent days said that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO allies that do not meet alliance-set spending goals on their own defense. Johnson has said that he will not bring the Senate-passed aid measure to the floor. But Turner has publicly supported continuing to fund the Ukraine war effort. Some lawmakers and US officials privately speculated that his effort to brief lawmakers on the intelligence — something the House Intelligence Committee voted on Tuesday night to do — might be an attempt to shore up flagging support for Ukraine. Sources declined to provide further detail on the intelligence or the Russian capabilities it describes. But for years, Russia has pursued counterspace systems designed to neutralize US military and commercial space systems, according to a 2022 Defense Intelligence Agency report on space security. Russian doctrine called for being able to target an enemy’s satellites from the ground, air, cyber and space, using attacks that range from temporary jamming to outright destruction. In 2020, Russia tested a space-based anti-satellite weapon with sophisticated orbital capabilities that could have a dual purpose: it could service and inspect friendly satellites while having the capability to attack enemy satellites. An attempt to launch a nuclear-armed anti-satellite system into space would violate The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which explicitly prohibits “any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction” in orbit","['us', 'new', 'intelligence', 'russian', 'military', 'capabilities', 'related', 'efforts', 'deploy', 'nuclear', 'antisatellite', 'system', 'space',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/mark-green-not-running-for-reelection/index.html,"House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green is not planning to seek reelection for his congressional seat, he announced Wednesday, in the wake of the House voting to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. “At the start of the 118th Congress, I promised my constituents to pass legislation to secure our borders and to hold Secretary Mayorkas accountable,” Green said in a statement. “Today, with the House having passed H.R. 2 and Secretary Mayorkas impeached, it is time for me to return home.” Shortly after announcing that he would not be running for reelection, Green told CNN that he had “accomplished” all that he “promised he would accomplish.” “You go out with a win,” he said. “I wanted to get a great border security bill done, we did that,” he said, referencing H.R. 2, which passed the GOP-majority House in May but is unlikely to move forward in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The Tennessee lawmaker also touted the House Republican impeachment of Mayorkas, an effort he helmed from his committee, telling CNN he had sought to “hold the administration accountable, and we just impeached for the first time a sitting cabinet secretary, who deserved it.” “I feel like there are other fights for me to get into,” he added. Green’s retirement comes as a wave of prominent House Republican lawmakers including GOP committee chairs have announced they are heading for the exits. Asked what his departure says about the state of the House Republican Conference, Green argued that any dysfunction is due to the slim margins in the House. “The other side vote their ideology, and it makes it very hard to get stuff done with a thin majority,” he said. “That’s just the way that is. What we need to do is win more seats, and have a bigger majority, and that’s what we’re going to do.” Multiple sources told CNN that Green has expressed interest in running for governor of Tennessee. Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee’s term ends in 2027. “I have come to realize our fight is not here within Washington, our fight is with Washington,” Green said in his announcement","['house', 'homeland', 'security', 'chairman', 'mark', 'green', 'planning', 'seek', 'reelection', 'congressional', 'seat', 'announced', 'wednesday', 'wake', 'house', 'voting', 'impeach', 'homeland', 'security', 'secretary', 'alejandro', 'mayorkas', '“at', 'start', '118th', 'congress', 'promised', 'constituents', 'pass', 'legislation', 'secure', 'borders', 'hold', 'secretary', 'mayorkas', 'accountable”', 'green', 'statement', '“today', 'house', 'passed', 'hr', '2', 'secretary', 'mayorkas', 'impeached', 'return', 'home”', 'shortly', 'announcing', 'running', 'reelection', 'green', '“accomplished”', '“promised', 'accomplish”', '“you', 'go', 'win”', 'wanted', 'great', 'border', 'security', 'bill', 'done', 'that”', 'referencing', 'hr', '2', 'passed', 'gopmajority', 'house', 'may', 'unlikely', 'move', 'forward', 'democratcontrolled', 'senate', 'tennessee', 'lawmaker', 'touted', 'house', 'republican', 'impeachment', 'mayorkas', 'effort', 'helmed', 'committee', 'telling', 'sought', '“hold', 'administration', 'accountable', 'impeached', 'first', 'sitting', 'cabinet', 'secretary', 'deserved', 'it”', 'feel', 'like', 'fights', 'into”', 'added', 'green’s', 'retirement', 'comes', 'wave', 'prominent', 'house', 'republican', 'lawmakers', 'including', 'gop', 'committee', 'chairs', 'announced', 'heading', 'exits', 'asked', 'departure', 'state', 'house', 'republican', 'conference', 'green', 'argued', 'dysfunction', 'due', 'slim', 'margins', 'house', '“the', 'side', 'vote', 'ideology', 'makes', 'hard', 'stuff', 'done', 'thin', 'majority”', '“that’s', 'way', 'need', 'win', 'seats', 'bigger', 'majority', 'that’s', 'we’re', 'going', 'do”', 'multiple', 'sources', 'green', 'expressed', 'interest', 'running', 'governor', 'tennessee', 'republican', 'tennessee', 'gov', 'bill', 'lee’s', 'term', 'ends', '2027', 'come', 'realize', 'fight', 'within', 'washington', 'fight', 'washington”', 'green', 'announcement']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/special-counsel-supreme-court-trump-response/index.html,"Special counsel Jack Smith pressed the SupremeCourt on Wednesday to let stand a lower court ruling that denied former Trump immunity from prosecution, urging the justices to allow the trial in his election subversion case to begin quickly. “The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy,” Smith told the SupremeCourt. “A president’s alleged criminal scheme to overturn an election and thwart the peaceful transfer of power to his successor should be the last place to recognize a novel form of absolute immunity from federal criminal law,” the special counsel added. Trump speaks outside the courtroom after testifying at NewYork SupremeCourt, Monday, November 6, 2023, in NewYork. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AP Related article Trump expected to attend NY hush money hearing Thursday, lawyer says Smith’s filing was a response to an emergency request to the SupremeCourt that Trump made Monday, seeking to pause proceedings so he could appeal a DC Circuit decision that denied him the ability to claim presidential immunity. Trump has argued that the “presidency as we know it will cease to exist” if the lower court’s ruling was allowed to stand. Smith’s response came days before it was due, underscoring the special counsel’s desire to rapidly move to trial. Smith argued Trump cannot meet the standard required to block the lower court’s ruling. “Delay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a speedy and fair verdict,” Smith wrote. Smith asked that if the court orders a delay that it consider the request an appeal and set the case for expedited briefing and argument. In that circumstance, Smith asked that the arguments take place next month. The special counsel’s response drew heavily on history, quoting from Alexander Hamilton and other founding-era leaders, to establish the idea that presidents should be held accountable for their conduct. He argued that Trump was unable to “point to any Founding Era suggestion of such absolute immunity,” which he said underscored “how remote the possibility is that this court will agree with his unprecedented legal position.” A unanimous opinion from the DC Circuit last week allowed Trump to face charges for actions he took to subvert the 2020 election and brushed aside his claims that former presidents are immune from such prosecution. Trump on Monday asked the SupremeCourt to temporarily block that decision so he could appeal it. He has argued that denying immunity would open future presidents up to criminal prosecution as soon as they leave office. The timing of the SupremeCourt’s handling of Trump request is critical. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, would benefit from delaying his trial until after the November election. Smith, on the other hand, is eager to not let that happen. Earlier Tuesday, Chief Justice John Roberts gave Smith until February 20 to respond to Trump emergency request. Trump is now expected to file a reply to Smith and the justices will decide how to proceed in short order – likely within a few days. “The public interest in a prompt trial is at its zenith where, as here, a former president is charged with conspiring to subvert the electoral process so that he could remain in office,” Smith told the court","['special', 'counsel', 'jack', 'smith', 'pressed', 'supremecourt', 'wednesday', 'let', 'stand', 'lower', 'court', 'ruling', 'denied', 'trump', 'immunity', 'prosecution', 'urging', 'justices', 'allow', 'trial', 'election', 'subversion', 'case', 'begin', 'quickly', '“the', 'charged', 'crimes', 'strike', 'heart', 'democracy”', 'smith', 'supremecourt', '“a', 'president’s', 'alleged', 'criminal', 'scheme', 'overturn', 'election', 'thwart', 'peaceful', 'transfer', 'power', 'successor', 'last', 'place', 'recognize', 'novel', 'form', 'absolute', 'immunity', 'federal', 'criminal', 'law”', 'special', 'counsel', 'added', 'trump', 'speaks', 'outside', 'courtroom', 'testifying', 'newyork', 'supremecourt', 'monday', 'november', '6', '2023', 'newyork', 'eduardo', 'munoz', 'alvarezap', 'related', 'article', 'trump', 'expected', 'attend', 'ny', 'hush', 'money', 'hearing', 'thursday', 'lawyer', 'smith’s', 'filing', 'response', 'emergency', 'request', 'supremecourt', 'trump', 'made', 'monday', 'seeking', 'pause', 'proceedings', 'appeal', 'dc', 'circuit', 'decision', 'denied', 'ability', 'claim', 'presidential', 'immunity', 'trump', 'argued', '“presidency', 'know', 'cease', 'exist”', 'lower', 'court’s', 'ruling', 'allowed', 'stand', 'smith’s', 'response', 'came', 'days', 'due', 'underscoring', 'special', 'counsel’s', 'desire', 'rapidly', 'move', 'trial', 'smith', 'argued', 'trump', 'cannot', 'meet', 'standard', 'required', 'block', 'lower', 'court’s', 'ruling', '“delay', 'resolution', 'charges', 'threatens', 'frustrate', 'public', 'interest', 'speedy', 'fair', 'verdict”', 'smith', 'wrote', 'smith', 'asked', 'court', 'orders', 'delay', 'consider', 'request', 'appeal', 'set', 'case', 'expedited', 'briefing', 'argument', 'circumstance', 'smith', 'asked', 'arguments', 'take', 'place', 'next', 'month', 'special', 'counsel’s', 'response', 'drew', 'heavily', 'history', 'quoting', 'alexander', 'hamilton', 'foundingera', 'leaders', 'establish', 'idea', 'presidents', 'held', 'accountable', 'conduct', 'argued', 'trump', 'unable', '“point', 'founding', 'era', 'suggestion', 'absolute', 'immunity”', 'underscored', '“how', 'remote', 'possibility', 'court', 'agree', 'unprecedented', 'legal', 'position”', 'unanimous', 'opinion', 'dc', 'circuit', 'last', 'week', 'allowed', 'trump', 'face', 'charges', 'actions', 'took', 'subvert', '2020', 'election', 'brushed', 'aside', 'claims', 'presidents', 'immune', 'prosecution', 'trump', 'monday', 'asked', 'supremecourt', 'temporarily', 'block', 'decision', 'appeal', 'argued', 'denying', 'immunity', 'open', 'future', 'presidents', 'criminal', 'prosecution', 'soon', 'leave', 'office', 'timing', 'supremecourt’s', 'handling', 'trump', 'request', 'critical', 'trump', 'frontrunner', 'republican', 'presidential', 'nomination', 'benefit', 'delaying', 'trial', 'november', 'election', 'smith', 'hand', 'eager', 'let', 'happen', 'earlier', 'tuesday', 'chief', 'justice', 'john', 'roberts', 'gave', 'smith', 'february', '20', 'respond', 'trump', 'emergency', 'request', 'trump', 'expected', 'file', 'reply', 'smith', 'justices', 'decide', 'proceed', 'short', 'order', 'likely', 'within', 'days', '“the', 'public', 'interest', 'prompt', 'trial', 'zenith', 'president', 'charged', 'conspiring', 'subvert', 'electoral', 'process', 'remain', 'office”', 'smith', 'court']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/us-navy-houthi-fight-red-sea/index.html,"On board the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower CNN — Alarms blared on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea at 4 a.m. on Tuesday morning, warning personnel to prepare for potential flight operations against a Houthi drone that was flying over nearby ships. That drone was ultimately deemed not to be a threat. But the incident demonstrated how the crew of the carrier are constantly on a heightened alert for incoming threats from the Iran-backed militants in Yemen, who have been routinely targeting commercial ships as well as US and coalition forces in the key waterway with missiles and drones. On board two vessels spearheading the US response to Houthi attacks, the Eisenhower and the US destroyer the USS Gravely in the southern Red Sea, CNN gained unique access and spoke to sailors and pilots who said the Houthi threat remains both unpredictable and unprecedented. The US Navy is working at a frenetic pace, deploying jets and firing missiles at a moment’s notice to try to destroy the Houthis’ weapons and infrastructure. But after dozens of strikes over the last month against Houthi targets both over the Red Sea and inside Yemen, CNN was told that the US military still does not know exactly how much of the Houthis’ capabilities have been destroyed—or how long it will take to deter them for good. “It’s a wicked problem set that we don’t have a lot of great fidelity on,” said Rear Admiral Marc Miguez, the commander of Carrier Strike Group Two, told CNN on Tuesday. Unlike state actors like Iran, Russia and China that the US has prioritized for intelligence collection for years, the US was not paying close attention to the Houthis before they started regularly lobbing missiles into the Red Sea, Miguez said. So the US does not know for sure how much the Houthis have stockpiled, particularly when it comes to what they have buried underground. Learning in real time The Houthis’ attacks, moreover, mark the first time anti-ship ballistic missiles have been used in combat, and the personnel on board the warships are learning in real time how to respond. “This isn’t exactly where we expected to be on this deployment,” said Captain James Huddleston, the deputy commander of Carrier Air Wing 3 who regularly flies missions over the Red Sea and Yemen. “Whenever you are doing something for the first time in a region, that’s not without risk,” Huddleston said. “But we have managed that risk to our strike group and our air crew through the management of combat power.” Dozens of fighter jets take off every day from the Ike carrier to circle the skies over the Red Sea in case they are tasked at a moment’s notice with carrying out a strike against a Houthi target. An F/A-18 with afterburner prepares to launch from the deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea. Scott Pisczek/CNN All of the jets carry air to ground missiles so they can respond immediately to a threat, Miguez said. “Unfortunately, we don’t get a lot of heads up on most of this stuff—especially the ballistic missiles,” he said. The Houthis have also changed their tactics in recent weeks, using drones more regularly to target and attack ships. “They have tried to target coalition forces, US forces, through swarm attacks, using multiple UAVs, using multiple anti-ship ballistic cruise missiles,” said Captain Marvin Scott, the commanding officer of Carrier Air Wing 3. “They are trying everything that they can, but we are prepared for anything they may throw our way.” In many cases the Houthis have been using the Samad-3 drone, Miguez said, which is long-range and carries an explosive payload. The Houthis have also been using Iranian-made drones, according to the Defense Intelligence Agency. “We know for a fact that they are a threat, so we have been taking them down more and more frequently,” he said. CNN previously reported that the US intelligence community has picked up signs that the Iranians are getting nervous about the Houthis’ attacks because of the impact they have had on some of Iran’s only allies, including China and India. Officials believe Iran was at one point using one of its suspected spy ships which has long been parked in the southern Red Sea, the Behshad, to help the Houthis target vessels there. But in a notable shift, Iran moved the ship to the coast of Djibouti earlier this month for the first time in over two years, Miguez said. That has reduced the Houthis’ capability to track ships in the Gulf of Aden, Miguez said. Seconds or minutes to respond Meanwhile, the crew on board the USS Gravely destroyer in the Red Sea are the tip of the spear against inbound Houthi missiles and drones. The sailors often only have seconds to respond to an inbound missile. “We could have seconds, or we could have minutes,” said Navy Lieutenant JG James Rodney, who works in the Gravely’s Combat Information Center. “I wouldn’t say much more than minutes.” The Gravely is equipped with long-range Tomahawk missiles that are capable of reaching targets inside Yemen. But more often, the ship is deploying its anti-air and anti-surface missiles at closer ranges as Houthi missiles and drones close in. Last month, however, a Houthi missile got so close to the Gravely—within one mile of it—that the ship had to use its last line of defense, known as the Phalanx, to take it down. That incident is now being investigated, Miguez said. The Houthis barrages have been so relentless that the Ike carrier and the destroyers deployed nearby have not made a port call in months, which is highly unusual. Sailors said the environment is stressful, but that it has helped to have a mission. “It’s definitely not what we expected, to be out here,” said FC1 Michael Zito, who helps to operate the Gravely’s 54-caliber Mark 45 gun and other weapons systems on board. “We expected to have a more relaxed and chill deployment","['board', 'uss', 'dwight', 'eisenhower', 'alarms', 'blared', 'uss', 'dwight',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/jim-jordan-biden-ghostwriter-special-counsel-report/index.html,"House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan sent a letter to Biden ’s ghostwriter asking for information and an interview after special counsel Robert Hur reported that Biden shared some classified information with him in 2017, according to a letter first obtained by CNN. Jordan asked Mark Zwonitzer to turn over his audio recording of any interviews or conversations with Biden for his memoirs “Promise Me, Dad” and “Promises to Keep,” as well as all documents, communications and contracts related to his ghostwriting work that he shared with the special counsel. Jordan said he wants the materials by February 23. He also requested that Zwonitzer appear for a transcribed interview. “In light of Special Counsel Hur’s investigation and report, the Committee requires materials and information currently in your possession,” Jordan wrote. According to Hur’s report, in 2017 – after leaving the vice president’s office – Biden worked with a ghostwriter for his memoir and told the writer in a recorded conversation that he had “just found all the classified stuff downstairs,” which investigators believed referred to the home he was renting in Virginia. Investigators believed the evidence suggested Biden was referring to classified documents about the Afghanistan troop surge in 2009 – which FBI agents later found in his garage in Delaware. Hur’s report said the “best case for charges” would rely on Biden possessing classified documents in 2017, since it was after he had left the vice presidency and before he became president in 2021. But, Hur ultimately did not present any charges. In a news conference following the release of the report, the president said of the allegations of sharing classified information with his ghostwriter, “I did not share classified information, I did not share it.” The report said, “several defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.” “For example, Mr. Biden could have found the classified Afghanistan documents at his Virginia home in 2017 and then forgotten about them soon after. This could convince some reasonable jurors that he did not retain them willfully,” the report said. The report also said that the fact that Biden never talked about the documents again in the “dozens of hours” of recorded conversations with his ghostwriter, paired with how the documents were found in Biden garage – in a damaged box surrounded by “household detritus” – could suggest Biden had forgotten about them. “In addition, Mr. Biden memory was significantly limited, both during his recorded interviews with the ghostwriter in 2017, and in his interview with our office in 2023,” the report said. “And his cooperation with our investigation, including by reporting to the government that the Afghanistan documents were in his Delaware garage, will likely convince some jurors that he made an innocent mistake, rather than acting willfully – that is, with intent to break the law – as the statute requires.” Hur also said Biden conversations with his ghostwriter “from 2017 are often painfully slow, with Mr. Biden struggling to remember events and straining at times to read and relay his own notebook entries.” Prosecutors ultimately did not charge Zwonitzer with obstruction of justice after learning the ghostwriter deleted audio recordings he had that were of “significant evidentiary value.” The FBI was able to mostly recover the deleted files after Zwonitzer turned over his computer and external hard drive, according to the report","['house', 'judiciary', 'chair', 'jim', 'jordan', 'sent', 'letter', 'biden', '’s', 'ghostwriter', 'asking', 'information', 'interview', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'hur', 'reported', 'biden', 'shared', 'classified', 'information', '2017', 'according', 'letter', 'first', 'obtained', 'jordan', 'asked', 'mark', 'zwonitzer', 'turn', 'audio', 'recording', 'interviews', 'conversations', 'biden', 'memoirs', '“promise', 'dad”', '“promises', 'keep”', 'well', 'documents', 'communications', 'contracts', 'related', 'ghostwriting', 'work', 'shared', 'special', 'counsel', 'jordan', 'wants', 'materials', 'february', '23', 'requested', 'zwonitzer', 'appear', 'transcribed', 'interview', '“in', 'light', 'special', 'counsel', 'hur’s', 'investigation', 'report', 'committee', 'requires', 'materials', 'information', 'currently', 'possession”', 'jordan', 'wrote', 'according', 'hur’s', 'report', '2017', 'leaving', 'vice', 'president’s', 'office', 'biden', 'worked', 'ghostwriter', 'memoir', 'writer', 'recorded', 'conversation', '“just', 'found', 'classified', 'stuff', 'downstairs”', 'investigators', 'believed', 'referred', 'home', 'renting', 'virginia', 'investigators', 'believed', 'evidence', 'suggested', 'biden', 'referring', 'classified', 'documents', 'afghanistan', 'troop', 'surge', '2009', 'fbi', 'agents', 'later', 'found', 'garage', 'delaware', 'hur’s', 'report', '“best', 'case', 'charges”', 'rely', 'biden', 'possessing', 'classified', 'documents', '2017', 'since', 'left', 'vice', 'presidency', 'became', 'president', '2021', 'hur', 'ultimately', 'present', 'charges', 'conference', 'following', 'release', 'report', 'president', 'allegations', 'sharing', 'classified', 'information', 'ghostwriter', 'share', 'classified', 'information', 'share', 'it”', 'report', '“several', 'defenses', 'likely', 'create', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'charges”', '“for', 'example', 'mr', 'biden', 'found', 'classified', 'afghanistan', 'documents', 'virginia', 'home', '2017', 'forgotten', 'soon', 'convince', 'reasonable', 'jurors', 'retain', 'willfully”', 'report', 'report', 'fact', 'biden', 'never', 'talked', 'documents', '“dozens', 'hours”', 'recorded', 'conversations', 'ghostwriter', 'paired', 'documents', 'found', 'biden', 'garage', 'damaged', 'box', 'surrounded', '“household', 'detritus”', 'suggest', 'biden', 'forgotten', '“in', 'addition', 'mr', 'biden', 'memory', 'significantly', 'limited', 'recorded', 'interviews', 'ghostwriter', '2017', 'interview', 'office', '2023”', 'report', '“and', 'cooperation', 'investigation', 'including', 'reporting', 'government', 'afghanistan', 'documents', 'delaware', 'garage', 'likely', 'convince', 'jurors', 'made', 'innocent', 'mistake', 'rather', 'acting', 'willfully', 'intent', 'break', 'law', 'statute', 'requires”', 'hur', 'biden', 'conversations', 'ghostwriter', '“from', '2017', 'often', 'painfully', 'slow', 'mr', 'biden', 'struggling', 'remember', 'events', 'straining', 'times', 'read', 'relay', 'notebook', 'entries”', 'prosecutors', 'ultimately', 'charge', 'zwonitzer', 'obstruction', 'justice', 'learning', 'ghostwriter', 'deleted', 'audio', 'recordings', '“significant', 'evidentiary', 'value”', 'fbi', 'able', 'mostly', 'recover', 'deleted', 'files', 'zwonitzer', 'turned', 'computer', 'external', 'hard', 'drive', 'according', 'report']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/tiktok-biden-campaign/index.html,"The Biden campaign’s venture onto TikTok has been met with mixed reviews, as some supporters praise the attempt to explore new ways to reach young adults while others insist the account needs to engage on a more substantive level to appear authentic. The account, created Sunday, has released a dozen posts, a mix of cable news clips bashing former Trump , jokes about Biden ’s age, a Super Bowl video featuring the Dark Brandon meme and a clip of campaign staffers defending him against special counsel Robert Hur’s comments on his mental acuity. Supporters of the president’s reelection efforts say the new account is a step in the right direction and offers an outlet to better tout what his administration has accomplished for young people, such as a TikTok featuring a former school principal whose student loans were forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But critics, and some allies, warn that there is a fine line between genuinely engaging with voter and being performative. “If he is just getting on the platform to share memes, I think he’s going to find tons of pushback and comment sections that are full of people calling him out,” Dakota Hall, executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action, told CNN. A new source for news For the Biden campaign, joining the social media site presents the possibility for modest rewards but also high risks. Digital strategists see TikTok as a critical tool for Democrat candidates to reach young voter, a bloc that has soured on Biden amidst rising inflation, concerns about his age and his administration’s response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “I think they had to launch one,” said Cate Domino, a senior vice president for digital at Precision Strategies, a Democrat consulting firm. “At this point, TikTok use has grown extremely rapidly, even in the past four years, and to not have a place to contribute to the narrative there would be malpractice.” Biden won 60% of 18- to 29-year-old voter and 52% of 30- to 44-year-olds in 2020, according to CNN exit poll data. But recent polling has shown his grasp on that bloc slipping . A CNN/SSRS poll released February 1 found Biden winning 49% of 18- to 34-year-olds, compared to 46% who backed Trump. While only a third of Americans have ever used TikTok, 62% of 18- to 29-year-olds have, according to a survey by Pew Research released last month. Last November, Pew found that 32% of 18- to 29-year-olds regularly get their news from the app. “The campaign is now on TikTok because frankly that’s where people are,” Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster said in a statement to CNN. “Having a presence on TikTok gives us the chance to maximize the reach of the president’s vision.” Campaigns have, for the most part, avoided the platform. Republican have supported banning the app, which is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company, over national security and spying concerns. Biden signed legislation banning the use of TikTok on government devices in 2022. Those concerns have kept the White House off the app and may have delayed the Biden campaign’s decision to join. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the ban remains in effect. The campaign has said they are taking “advanced safety precautions” around the app. Despite security concerns, some politicians have found success on the app. Democrat Rep. Jeff Jackson of North Carolina has amassed 2.5 million followers with his straight-to-camera videos explaining the goings on of Congress. Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, has more than 240,000 followers on his account, which was launched during his 2022 run against Republican Mehmet Oz. The account used memes to bash Oz and paint him as a financially out of touch carpetbagger. “It’s not a copy and paste formula,” said Annie Wu Henry, a digital communications strategist who ran Fetterman’s account. “It shouldn’t look the same, because you shouldn’t be telling one person to do something that doesn’t feel right or make sense for them.” Unlike the Fetterman and Jackson accounts, the Biden campaign’s account – Biden-Harris HQ – is not solely focused on the president, who has appeared in less than half of the videos so far. One two-minute TikTok posted Tuesday features communications director Michael Tyler and deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty defending Biden and blasting press coverage of the Hur report on the president’s handling of classified papers. The report did not recommend charges against Biden but said the president presented as a “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” and struggled to recall key details, including the year his son Beau died. The president and his allies have pushed back against what they said were false characterization of Biden memory. “There’s one line in the document that matters: the first one,” Tyler says in the video. “Biden was completely cleared of wrongdoing, and with your help we’ll beat Trump, the lazy media narrative and the MAGA Republican they’re enabling in November.” Coming off phony Some groups supporting the president’s reelection efforts say Biden joining the social media platform is a step in the right direction that could help him better tout what his administration has done for young people. “It’s a meaningful signal that the Biden campaign acknowledges the power that young voter will have in November and prioritizes engagement with us,” said Jack Lobel, the national press secretary for Voters of Tomorrow. He added: “Young people have been left out of the political process for decades. So we need to take every route possible to bring them into the process.” Young voter have expressed their frustrations over Biden handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict and his refusal to support a permanent ceasefire. And as Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail, protests have continued to follow them at appearances across the country – and, now, into the comments section. Ariana Afshar, a 27-year-old California-based content creator with more than 200,000 followers on TikTok, said the campaign’s TikTok doesn’t change the fact that he has refused to support a ceasefire in Gaza. She doesn’t plan on voting for the president. “This technique would’ve been successful, in my opinion, if he actually listened to young voter,” said. “But he doesn’t, so it’s coming off a bit phony.” Hours after Biden released his first video on the social media platform, where he weighed in on the Super Bowl and who he’ll support in the upcoming election, Israel carried out military airstrikes in Gaza as part of a hostage rescue mission, killing more than 100 people in Rafah. Claire Simon, the communications coordinator for Gen-Z for Change, a national youth-led organization that was once known as TikTok for Biden, pointed to the comments as evidence that some saw the strategy as “incredibly tone-deaf.” She pointed to the dozens of comments on the campaign’s first TikTok asking about Rafah. “It’s really a substance-over-style issue he’s having,” she said. “A lot of young people are pretty unhappy with Biden … a TikTok account isn’t really going to fix that issue for him.” Facing critics TikTok’s comment section can be a source for engagement but also a breeding ground for trolls. To date, the Biden campaign’s videos have received comments praising the president, praising Trump, questioning Biden mental fitness and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The campaign can ignore the spam, but needs to engage with the good faith criticisms, digital strategists say. “Once you’re on TikTok, you’re in a more one-to-one relationship with supporters,” said Kasey O’Brien, the director of social & texting at Middle Seat, a progressive strategy and consultant firm. “There will be more opportunities for him to expand on and explain his policy positions.” Creating space for negative feedback could also help the campaign show that it’s listening and taking young voter seriously, Henry said. “One thing that … young people don’t like is pandering,” she said. “An 18-year-old’s vote is worth the exact same as a 60 year old’s vote.”","['biden', 'campaign’s', 'venture', 'onto', 'tiktok', 'met', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'supporters', 'praise', 'attempt',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/biden-palestinians-temporary-protection-deportation/index.html,"Biden granted Palestinians in the United States temporary protection from deportation amid the ongoing conflict overseas, according to a new memo Wednesday. The move comes as the White House faces immense pressure from the Arab-American community over the situation in Gaza. Late last year, Democrat urged Biden to extend temporary protections to Palestinians in the US, arguing that those already in the country “should not be forced to return to the Palestinian territories, consistent with Biden’s stated commitment to protecting Palestinian civilians.” The president has discretion to authorize what’s known as deferred enforced departure, which protects those covered from removal from the US for a period of time. Those who qualify are also eligible for work permits. “In light of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian needs on the ground, Biden signed a memorandum directing the deferral of removal of certain Palestinians who are present in the United States, giving them a temporary safe haven,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement Wednesday. “Specifically, Biden is granting deferred enforced departure for 18 months to Palestinians that are currently in the United States,” the statement continued. Those convicted of felonies or who pose a public safety threat are not eligible for deferred enforced departure.","['biden', 'granted', 'palestinians', 'united', 'states', 'temporary', 'protection', 'deportation', 'amid', 'ongoing', 'conflict', 'overseas', 'according', 'new', 'memo', 'wednesday', 'move', 'comes', 'white', 'house', 'faces', 'immense', 'pressure', 'arabamerican', 'community', 'situation', 'gaza', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'democrat', 'urged', 'biden', 'extend', 'temporary', 'protections', 'palestinians', 'us', 'arguing', 'already', 'country', '“should', 'forced', 'return', 'palestinian', 'territories', 'consistent', 'biden’s', 'stated', 'commitment', 'protecting', 'palestinian', 'civilians”', 'president', 'discretion', 'authorize', 'what’s', 'known', 'deferred', 'enforced', 'departure', 'protects', 'covered', 'removal', 'us', 'period', 'qualify', 'eligible', 'work', 'permits', '“in', 'light', 'ongoing', 'conflict', 'humanitarian', 'needs', 'ground', 'biden', 'signed', 'memorandum', 'directing', 'deferral', 'removal', 'certain', 'palestinians', 'present', 'united', 'states', 'giving', 'temporary', 'safe', 'haven”', 'white', 'house', 'national', 'security', 'adviser', 'jake', 'sullivan', 'statement', 'wednesday', '“specifically', 'biden', 'granting', 'deferred', 'enforced', 'departure', '18', 'months', 'palestinians', 'currently', 'united', 'states”', 'statement', 'continued', 'convicted', 'felonies', 'pose', 'public', 'safety', 'threat', 'eligible', 'deferred', 'enforced', 'departure']"

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — The immigration and border crisis is quickly morphing into the dominant issue of American politics – and Democrat are pivoting faster than Republican at the moment. GOP lawmakers have long claimed immigration as their top issue, raising the alarm about the drastic rise of migrants and asylum-seekers at the southern border. Blaming Biden for the border crisis is the backbone of Trump presidential campaign. But after a defeat in a special election to fill a NewYork House seat, Republican might be wondering if they are being outmaneuvered by Democrat who are adjusting to acknowledge the crisis and suddenly preaching bipartisanship. A drastic, new migrant policy under consideration by the Biden administration will only heap pressure on Republican to relent and seek middle ground with the White House even as they complain about Biden current policy. Here’s what’s happened with immigration so far this week: Republican, committed to casting blame, impeach Mayorkas. It took two tries, but House Republican made their point and voted by the narrowest possible margin to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , the first impeachment of a Cabinet secretary since the 1870s. The Senate, which is controlled by Democrat, will surely acquit Mayorkas or figure out a way to dismiss the charges, but not without an unwanted spectacle. There are consequences for failing to legislate. After the failure of a bipartisan Senate compromise to revamp border policy and add funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Biden administration has drawn up a draft contingency plan to address a massive budget shortfall by cutting detention capacity and releasing thousands of immigrants. The House GOP majority shrank. It’s a good thing for the Republican who supported the impeachment that they got it done Tuesday night, since Democrat picked up a seat in the special election to replace disgraced former Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from the House in December. Democrat are triangulating. How did the winner in NewYork, former Rep. Tom Suozzi , win back his old seat? He tacked to the middle specifically on the issue of immigration, hammering Republican for refusing to work with Democrat on an immigration compromise. “Let’s send a message to our friends running the Congress these days: Stop running around for Trump, and start running the country,” Suozzi told supporters after claiming victory Tuesday night.

Immigration might have been the issue on which Republican could have kept the seat despite the bad taste Santos may have left in voter’ mouths. A serial fabulist who misrepresented just about everything in his background, Santos is set to be prosecuted for, among other things, defrauding donors to his 2022 campaign. But NewYork is feeling the pinch of the immigration crisis. Mayor Eric Adams has complained the city can no longer cope with the thousands of migrants being shipped to the city by, among others, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Republican say NBD. Even though Suozzi’s win shrinks the narrow House Republican majority even further and makes it more difficult for Speaker Mike Johnson to pass any legislation, Johnson told fellow GOP lawmakers not to panic during a closed-door meeting Wednesday, according to CNN’s Capitol Hill team. Later, he noted that Democrat spent more money on the race than Republican and told reporters that Suozzi won because he “ran like a Republican.” “He sounded like a Republican, talking about the border and immigration, because everybody knows that’s the top issue,” Johnson said. Except voter concerned about immigration told CNN reporters that it was also dysfunction on Capitol Hill – Republican rejected even the idea of a bipartisan immigration deal last week – that drove their vote. Democrat and Republican in the Senate joined together to pass a foreign aid package this week after it was decoupled from the border compromise. But Johnson opposes allowing vote on that bill too. This is the definition of a catch-22. Without any irony after helping kill the border compromise, Johnson said he could not accept any aid for Ukraine and Israel until there is action on the border. “House Republican were crystal clear from the very beginning of discussions that any so-called national security supplemental legislation must recognize that national security begins at our own border,” Johnson said in a statement, days after helping kill legislation to address the situation at the border. Democrat are embracing the rhetoric of bipartisanship – for now. Reacting to Suozzi’s victory, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that voter respond to people who want to solve problems. “Tom Suozzi talked about common-sense solutions. And finding bipartisan common ground. Tom Suozzi won,” Jeffries said. Fight or flight? It’s perfectly reasonable to wonder why anyone would want to work on Capitol Hill. Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin , one of three Republican to vote against impeaching Mayorkas, was surrounded and pressured by colleagues on the House floor last week during the first impeachment effort. Days later, he announced he would not run for reelection. “Electoral politics was never supposed to be a career and, trust me, Congress is no place to grow old,” Gallagher, who had been viewed as a rising star in the party, said in a statement. Compare that with former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan , an anti-Trump Republican who recently announced he would run for a seat in the US Senate after previously saying he had no interest in working on Capitol Hill. He still isn’t exactly excited about it, Hogan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “Inside Politics” on Wednesday. “Who in their right mind would want to go in and be a part of that divisiveness and dysfunction?” Hogan asked. But he made the decision a week ago, he said, after the “debacle that took place on the Senate floor” when the bipartisan immigration deal was abandoned. Biden, he argued, has failed to secure the border. But Republican, given the opportunity to work toward a solution, backed off. “I thought it was typical dysfunction,” he later added. “I’m frustrated with both parties down there, and that’s a perfect example – it’s an important thing that most people in America want us to solve, and it’s not getting solved because it’s just typical Washington politics.”","['version', 'appeared', 'cnn’s',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/doj-guidelines-journalists-records/index.html,"The Justice Department released new guidance Wednesday to assist federal investigators abide by department rules when attempting to access journalists’ records. The department bars employees from secretly seeking reporters’ records except in limited circumstances. Attorney General Merrick Garland codified those rules after it was revealed that the Justice Department during the Trump administration had seized records from reporters at various news organizations, including CNN, The Washington Post and The NewYork Times. Under department rules, prosecutors are only allowed to subpoena journalists’ records in certain circumstances, including if the information they are seeking is imperative to prevent a serious crime, if the journalist themselves are the target of an investigation, if the records involve already public information or if the journalist agrees to the disclosure of their records. The guidance released Wednesday is intended to help DOJ personnel understand whether they can seek journalists records, and how they can abide by the rules if they plan to subpoena those records. “This Policy is not intended to extend special protections to members of the news media who are subjects or targets of a criminal investigation, or are parties to a civil investigation, for conduct outside the scope of newsgathering,” the guidance, posted on the department website , states. The guidance tells prosecutors to evaluate whether someone is a reporter by looking at “the frequency of the person’s or entity’s reporting and whether the person or entity brings information to the attention of the public, engages in newsgathering, has independent sources, holds press credentials, is employed by a member of the news media, and/or is widely identified as a journalist or reporter.” “The Department does not consider the ideology or viewpoint of a person or entity, or of its reporting, when determining whether that person or entity qualifies as a member of the news media for purposes of this Policy,” the guidance states. Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, praised the guidance in a statement to CNN. ﻿“The new guidance shows the commitment of DOJ leadership to further anchor within the Department the historic policy changes it put in place in 2022,” Brown said","['justice', 'department', 'released', 'new', 'guidance', 'wednesday', 'assist', 'federal', 'investigators', 'abide', 'department', 'rules', 'attempting', 'access', 'journalists’', 'records', 'department', 'bars', 'employees', 'secretly', 'seeking', 'reporters’', 'records', 'except', 'limited', 'circumstances', 'attorney', 'general', 'merrick', 'garland', 'codified', 'rules', 'revealed', 'justice', 'department', 'trump', 'administration', 'seized', 'records', 'reporters', 'various', 'organizations', 'including', 'washington', 'post', 'newyork', 'times', 'department', 'rules', 'prosecutors', 'allowed', 'subpoena', 'journalists’', 'records', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'including', 'information', 'seeking', 'imperative', 'prevent', 'serious', 'crime', 'journalist', 'target', 'investigation', 'records', 'involve', 'already', 'public', 'information', 'journalist', 'agrees', 'disclosure', 'records', 'guidance', 'released', 'wednesday', 'intended', 'help', 'doj', 'personnel', 'understand', 'whether', 'seek', 'journalists', 'records', 'abide', 'rules', 'plan', 'subpoena', 'records', '“this', 'policy', 'intended', 'extend', 'special', 'protections', 'members', 'media', 'subjects', 'targets', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'parties', 'civil', 'investigation', 'conduct', 'outside', 'scope', 'newsgathering”', 'guidance', 'posted', 'department', 'website', 'states', 'guidance', 'tells', 'prosecutors', 'evaluate', 'whether', 'someone', 'reporter', 'looking', '“the', 'frequency', 'person’s', 'entity’s', 'reporting', 'whether', 'person', 'entity', 'brings', 'information', 'attention', 'public', 'engages', 'newsgathering', 'independent', 'sources', 'holds', 'press', 'credentials', 'employed', 'member', 'media', 'andor', 'widely', 'identified', 'journalist', 'reporter”', '“the', 'department', 'consider', 'ideology', 'viewpoint', 'person', 'entity', 'reporting', 'determining', 'whether', 'person', 'entity', 'qualifies', 'member', 'media', 'purposes', 'policy”', 'guidance', 'states', 'bruce', 'brown', 'executive', 'director', 'reporters', 'committee', 'freedom', 'press', 'praised', 'guidance', 'statement', '\ufeff“the', 'new', 'guidance', 'shows', 'commitment', 'doj', 'leadership', 'anchor', 'within', 'department', 'historic', 'policy', 'changes', 'put', 'place', '2022”', 'brown']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/white-house-hur-investigation-biden/index.html,"Allies of Biden are pointing fingers at his legal and communications teams for missteps they say aggravated the political damage of special counsel Robert Hur’s findings in his classified documents investigation. Some leading Democrat politicians expressed their frustration directly to high-level administration officials in the wake of the report, insisting that the overall response to the probe had been too muted and that the release of the response was completely bungled politically. Hur declined to bring criminal charges against Biden and said the facts stopped short of finding he willfully retained classified material. But in doing so, Hur offered a deeply damaging portrait of an aging president beset by memory issues, who had trouble recalling dates and details during his five-hour interview with the special counsel. White House and Biden allies have taken aim at Hur for what they view as a gratuitous characterization of the president. But some Democrat and supporters of the president have questioned the decision to sit for a five-hour interview over two days last October amid a spiraling Middle East crisis. They’re also putting scrutiny on the decision to allow the interview to be recorded and for the communications strategy that they believe has added to the president’s reelection woes. A source close to the Biden legal team pushed back at the criticism of their strategy, saying, “After a hostile prosecutor investigated the president for 15 months trying to find something to charge, the Biden legal team strategy ended with zero indictments and total exoneration. That is an unequivocal win.” From the beginning of the documents matter, in November 2022 when classified documents turned up at a former office space Biden used between his vice-presidential tenure and his White House term, the president’s strategy focused on cooperating with the National Archives and FBI. The strategy was as much legal as it was political: Biden aides hoped to draw a contrast with Trump, whose alleged obstruction in his own classified documents investigation led to criminal charges. Indeed, Hur compared Biden cooperation favorably to Trump in his report. The president and the White House faced an additional incentive to cooperate. If they didn’t, the Justice Department was prepared to seek subpoenas to compel searches to retrieve documents, CNN has previously reported. Hur’s report, which concluded with no charges, would suggest that the strategy worked — except for the multiple instances in the report questioning Biden memory, including the line that listed among the reasons to not bring charges: “Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview with him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” Some close to Biden have questioned whether he received sound legal advice during the high-stakes investigation, a source told CNN, raising specific concerns about why lawyers allowed Biden to be interviewed in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7. White House Counsel Ed Siskel and Robert Bauer, the president’s personal attorney, were in the White House Map Room for the president’s interview with Hur, people briefed on the matter said. The interview took place after weeks of negotiations, a standard part of such investigations. Unlike Trump, whose lawyers refused to allow an in-person interview and instead submitted written answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller’s team in the Russian election interference investigation, Biden lawyers never contemplated such a move. The strategy of drawing a contrast with Trump, officials say, made sitting for an in-person interview a no-brainer. Surprise over the handling of Biden interview with Hur Several former Justice Department and White House lawyers who are experienced in dealing with situations where a president or vice president is being interviewed stressed the importance that lawyers negotiating with the special counsel have extensive criminal and trial experience. While the sources gave credit to Biden team for early cooperation with the National Archives and the FBI when classified documents were first found in Biden office and home, they stressed that special counsels often dig for an extensive level of detail, including through an interview process, to produce a final public report. Recognizing those factors would be critical when negotiating interview parameters, including whether it was recorded. “Sometimes you want a recording, and it helps you…for nuance and clarity,” one of the sources said. “But with a president or vice president, you would negotiate that because you know it is going to become part of the public record sooner or later.” “This could have easily been negotiated,” the source continued, voicing surprise at both the timing of the interview and the length of the sessions, which were spread out over two days on October 8 and 9. A White House official previously told CNN that Biden had been “understandably distracted” the weekend of the Hur interview, given that a war was breaking out in Israel. The interview with Hur had been scheduled well before the attacks in Israel, which consumed much of Biden time in the lead-up to the event. He spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an hour or so before the interview occurred. While there was some initial discussion of postponing the interview, Biden and his lawyers ultimately decided against it because they hoped it would help expedite Hur’s investigation. It also wasn’t clear when the next opportunity would be to block off large chucks of time on Biden schedule, particularly with a budding war in the Middle East. Officials also said Biden determined an interview would demonstrate he was being transparent with the special counsel and provide a contrast with Trump attempts to impede the investigation into his own handling of classified documents. One Democrat ally close to the White House said they couldn’t fault the president’s legal team for consenting to a recorded interview with the special counsel given the politically charged nature of the probe. They also wouldn’t second guess the decision to go ahead with the interview the weekend of October 8. “You can second guess it now, but at the time it clearly felt like the right thing to do to get it over with,” they said. “That’s a tougher call looking in hindsight.” Questions over decision to have Biden face the press The public-facing response in the immediate aftermath of the report’s release has also invited criticism. The choice for Biden to make remarks and take questions from reporters afterward – just hours after the Hur report came out – has been polarizing. While the president seized the opportunity to forcefully reject some of the claims in the report, including the fact that he allegedly couldn’t remember when his late son, Beau, had died, the impromptu news conference after the speech invited numerous questions about his mental acuity and age. Biden flashed deep irritation as he fielded those questions, and the president was undoubtedly on defense. It was a mistake for the White House to “put him out on weakness and not strength,” one administration official said. Others disagree. “I do think showing some fire in the belly was not a bad thing and for people to see,” said a former senior White House official. “I do think they had to show some urgency on Thursday night.” Some Biden allies also believed the optics of Biden statement – standing in front of a wall of shouting reporters, at moments appearing uncertain – could have been better managed, particularly at such a highly sensitive moment. The White House said Tuesday it was Biden own choice to appear Thursday evening from the Diplomatic Reception Room. “It was the president’s idea. It was his idea,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “You saw the president do this, make a statement and take questions from all of you, because he wanted to do it,” she said. As Biden was speaking from the podium, some of his senior-most aides – including communications adviser Anita Dunn, message guru Mike Donilon and chief of staff Jeff Zients – listened from the back of the room. Frustration with lack of coordinated response Some White House officials and Democrat close to the White House, including some former administration officials, were left wondering why there didn’t appear to be a clearer and more forceful pushback against Hur’s report the moment it was made public. When news of the report first broke, some White House officials felt frustrated about not having been armed with clear talking points, multiple sources said. The grave sensitivities surrounding the special counsel investigation naturally meant that only a very small group of Biden advisers were in the know about the details of the lengthy report – but that left some of those who were in the dark feeling discouraged. “It was clear from the outset that they were scrambling to land on a message,” said one former official, who wondered out loud whether it would have helped for more White House officials to have been in the loop to help prepare a more fulsome response. One person briefed on the matter pushed back against the suggestion that more staffers should have been briefed ahead of time. “The special counsel forced the attorneys who reviewed the report in advance not to share information about the contents with anyone else,” they said. White House officials stood by the forcefulness of the White House’s pushback to Hur’s report, saying not only did Biden take questions from reporters Thursday night, but the next day, White House counsel spokesman Ian Sams joined the press briefing. The White House has also sent a letter to the White House Correspondents’ Association taking issue with news coverage of the Hur report, the officials pointed out, while the Biden campaign has pointed to allies and legal experts questioning aspects of the report that the White House sees as problematic. Still, some Biden allies have questioned why the White House declined to have the president sit down with CBS News for a pre-Super Bowl interview – a unique opportunity to send a clear message to more than 100 million Americans tuning in over the weekend on the heels of the special counsel report. The White House said it didn’t want to interrupt a non-political event with a presidential interview and that the president would find “many other ways” to communicate with Americans.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/mitch-mcconnell-foreign-aid/index.html,"Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell strongly defended his handling of a foreign aid package and bipartisan border security deal that have come under heavy criticism from his right flank, saying bluntly that “every argument” against Ukraine aid is “wrong” and that the opposition amounts to a “political reaction” driven by former Trump . McConnell, having just presided over one of the most tumultuous periods in his nearly two-decade tenure atop the Senate GOP, said he has occasionally in the past been “on the short side” of GOP senators – like on government funding bills and debt ceiling hikes. But in an interview with CNN in his Senate office on Wednesday, McConnell called this battle over Ukraine aid a “rare issue” where he had to get well out front of his party, which has grown increasingly resistant to helping fund the foreign war amid the ascendant isolationist wing being driven by Trump. “It’s not a question of whether I’m frustrated or not,” McConnell said when asked about the criticism he’s endured from within his own party. “I feel strongly this is in our best interest, America’s best interest and the world’s best interests to do this. … And being beat up is something I’m kind of used to after 18 years.” Over the last few weeks, McConnell blessed a bipartisan border security deal that he tried to sell to GOP senators – only to see it derailed by House Republican leaders, fellow senators and Trump himself. Then, he helped push through the Senate a $95.3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan – only to find himself in the minority of his conference when 22 of the 49 GOP senators voted to approve the plan earlier this week. Now, House Speaker Mike Johnson is threatening to shelve the bill altogether – all with Trump backing. The US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024. Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article How each member of the Senate voted on foreign aid package In the interview, McConnell harkened back to his childhood when his father – a foot soldier in World War II – had warned about the Russian threat, something he says has only grown more pervasive decades later. “Every argument against this is wrong. Every single one of them,” McConnell said of providing billions more to Ukraine. “Most of the money’s being spent here. Europeans have done as much, and, after the $55 billion from the EU, more than we have. Not a single American soldier has lost their lives in this fight – we’ve got a bunch of people willing to kill Russians. I can’t find any argument against this that makes any sense.” McConnell added: “So I think it’s a political reaction led, obviously, by the likely nominee for president having a view and expressing a view on this. So I think that’s why we are where we are.” Senate GOP leader’s suggestion: A House vote on aid bill McConnell’s comments come as Johnson said on Wednesday that the House would not take up the aid package, with many in his party arguing it’s time to stop pouring money into Ukraine and calling for more aggressive border security measures than the package proposed by the bipartisan group of senators and blessed by the Senate GOP leader. “The Republican-led House will not be jammed or forced into passing a foreign aid bill that was opposed by most Republican senators and does nothing to secure own border,” Johnson said Wednesday. McConnell said he wouldn’t comment on Johnson’s assertion. But he suggested that the Senate bill should get a vote on the House floor. “Whatever advice I have for the speaker I give him privately, not publicly,” McConnell said. “The only thing I’ve said publicly is we’ve heard all kinds of rumors about what the vote would be on Ukraine. Why not have it?” In the interview, McConnell downplayed the influence of the isolationist wing of his party, arguing that Republican views about the US posture in the world have long been driven by their party’s presidential candidate – something not unusual now given Trump positions. “Having lived as long as I have, I’ve kind of observed the party go up-and-down on foreign involvements, depending usually on who the president is, or the nominee for president, having the biggest impact on public opinion,” McConnell said. McConnell, who turns 82 next week, has not said if he would run for the GOP leadership spot after his current term concludes at the end of the year. That position could grow more complicated for the Kentucky Republican if Trump wins the presidency, given the two haven’t spoken in more than three years and they had a major falling out after the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack. McConnell non-committal on Mayorkas trial and touts Senate border deal Adding to the challenges of governing under Trump: The former president has tried to scuttle the remaining big-ticket items that McConnell has tried to approve, including on border security. Meantime, the House GOP has aligned itself closely with Trump and taken steps that have made some Republican senators uneasy – including impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the problems at the border. McConnell said he hadn’t taken a position yet on the Mayorkas trial and whether he would vote to dismiss the charges. “I haven’t really thought about it,” McConnell said, noting that Democrat would move to quickly kill the proceedings. “So I don’t think we’ll have two endless trials like we’ve had recently.” In the interview, McConnell defended his handling of the push to get a border deal, noting that Republican had demanded one before green-lighting more Ukraine aid. And he continued to tout the border deal even though it has been heavily criticized by many in his party and ultimately collapsed. “So I picked James Lankford, who’s really smart, and, as you know, they worked on it for months, came up with a product supported by the border council, the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the Washington Post editorial page,” McConnell said, calling the plan “clearly an improvement over existing law.” After Republican said they wouldn’t support the border deal, McConnell said he “felt strongly” to move on the rest of the aid package without the immigration measures given the situation in Ukraine. Democrat have seized on the GOP decision to scuttle the border deal – something Democrat Tom Suozzi used i n his successful run in the NewYork special election for a US House seat on Tuesday night. But McConnell didn’t think the flap would have much of an impact on Senate races . “ I think that every one of these races will hash that out one way or another,” McConnell said. “Obviously up in NewYork, the Democrat did a better job of dealing with it than the Republican, and I think that’ll play out depending upon the quality of the candidates.” And he pivoted to the Senate GOP push to take back the majority: “I think we’re not going to have a candidate quality problem this cycle on our side .” On the border, McConnell added: “ I think Biden has a real problem on this issue with or without a new law.” But unlike his House GOP counterparts, McConnell did not take aim at Biden memory or mental acuity after concerns were raised by Special Counsel Robert Hur’s damning report last week about his handling of classified records. “The age issue is obviously front and center for both candidates,” McConnell said when asked about the matter","['senate', 'gop', 'leader', 'mitch',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/ice-draft-plan-release-migrants/index.html,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement has drafted contingency plans to cut detention capacity and release thousands of immigrants as a result, according to a source familiar with the plan. The draft plan comes as ICE faces a dire budget shortfall amid stalled congressional action on the White House supplemental request. The Department of Homeland Security has grappled with record levels of migrants at the US-Mexico border over the last year, draining federal resources and funds and prompting a White House ask for $14 billion in border security funding as part of a broader national security request. The supplemental provided $7.6 billion for ICE. Biden has repeatedly implored Congress to give him more resources to deal with the situation at the US-Mexico border, assigning blame on Republican for not doing more. “Giving up on real solutions right when they are needed most in order to play politics is not what the American people expect from their leaders. Congress needs to act to give me, Secretary Mayorkas, and my administration the tools and resources needed to address the situation at the border,” Biden said in a statement Tuesday, blasting the House GOP for impeaching Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. ICE – the immigration enforcement arm under DHS – has historically been underfunded and is now staring down a $700 million deficit, according to the source, resulting in discussions that include slashing detention space. Detention facilities and deportation flights are among the priciest budget items for ICE. The Washington Post first reported the draft plans. “The Administration has repeatedly requested additional resources for DHS’s vital missions on the southwest border and Congress has chronically underfunded them,” a Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement. “Without adequate funding for CBP, ICE, and USCIS, the Department will have to reprogram or pull resources from other efforts,” the spokesperson said, adding that ICE won’t be able to sustain its current operational tempo. Over recent years, ICE has assisted Customs and Border Protection in its border mission as that agency is also overwhelmed. In the past, when facing budget shortfalls, ICE has had to move money around within the agency, ask for reprogramming or rely on supplemental funds. Those funds often come from non-immigration related agencies, including Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, among others. The agency detains immigrants with criminal backgrounds, those preparing for removal and those who fall under mandatory detention. Border arrests dropped by 50% in January compared to December, according to newly released federal data. Homeland Security officials have attributed the decline to ongoing high-level talks between the US and Mexico, which has doubled down on enforcement, but caution that encounters historically drop in January before ticking up again. CBP Commissioner Troy Miller conceded authorities still face hurdles on the border, saying in a statement: “We continue to experience serious challenges along our border which surpass the capacity of the immigration system.” In January, the US Border Patrol reported 124,220 encounters along the US-Mexico border. Notably, there was a significant drop in Venezuelans – nearly 11,600 compared to 57,851 in December. Both the US and Mexico have restarted deportation flights to Venezuela. Without additional funding, CBP may also need to repurpose funds and draw back some operations, according to DHS.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/house-republicans-foreign-aid/index.html,"Speaker Mike Johnson is telling his House Republican Conference members that he is not rushing to respond to a bill sending aid to Ukraine and Israel, as GOP lawmakers weigh their options for how to handle the Senate-passed package . Johnson told his members at a closed-door meeting Wednesday that there’s “no rush” in deciding how to handle foreign aid, according to GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and did not tip his hand on how he plans to proceed other than making clear he would not put the Senate package on the House floor in its current form. Some rank-and-file members are drawing up their own proposals. Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania said he has been drafting a bipartisan plan to provide aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the border, which he plans to release in the next 24 to 48 hours and brief the speaker on. He said it will include a border security component, but not HR 2, the conservative Republican-led set of border policy changes that the House passed last year, and military aid for Ukraine, but not humanitarian assistance. “You see the conference that we have right now, this is this is essentially a coalition government at this point,” Fitzpatrick said of his strategy to work with Democrat on a plan. While Fitzpatrick said he personally would have supported the Senate version, he recognizes it doesn’t have wide support in the House. Fitzpatrick also said Johnson told members during a closed-door meeting that he has asked for a meeting with Biden on foreign aid but has so far denied the request. GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas also echoed support for rewriting the foreign aid package so that it only includes military aid for Ukraine, adding the GOP needs to a better job of messaging that a large portion of that funding doesn’t even go overseas, it goes to the Pentagon.

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images Related article Speaker Johnson’s historically narrow House majority will shrink further after Democrat flip seat in NewYork But some conservatives say they won’t support any Ukraine aid, even if it’s just narrow military aid. Rep. Bob Good, the Virginia Republican and chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said his preference is to just completely ignore the Senate package. But he did say there’s a “possibility” Republican could support Ukraine aid but only if it is paid for and also has HR 2, plus “enforcement mechanisms” – a high bar that would make it unpalatable in the Senate. “There’s the possibility that the Republican majority would support Ukraine aid paid for, with real border security attached to it,” Good said. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, also a Freedom Caucus member, laid out a number of conditions he would need in order to support Ukraine aid. He said it needs to be paid for and be accompanied by a “strong” border security plan as well as a clear strategy from the White House. “It starts with securing the border of the United States and paying for what we’re talking about, and then figure out where we go from there,” Roy said. “But again, I also want to see a clear mission.” House Republican debated several ideas to change the Senate-passed foreign aid package during a closed-door party meeting Tuesday night as well, including pairing back money to Ukraine, multiple attendees told CNN. One option that was discussed during the meeting was stripping the aid package of its humanitarian assistance for Ukraine and only including military aid for Ukraine. The thinking is that this could be more palatable to the Republican conference, though some far-right Republican might still think that’s too much. “I’m looking forward to something we can all agree to. And I think we should have been focused on military aid,” Rep. Don Bacon, a swing district Republican from Nebraska, told CNN. “In my view, there’s a lot of support for military aid right now. The other $20 billion, sending cash over, that’s where you start losing support.” Another idea talked about on Tuesday night was to incorporate some of the funding into portions of an upcoming annual spending bill for the Pentagon. “There may be some chopping and dicing, here and there,” Rep. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, told CNN. “There were three or four really good ideas about, you know, how we can do something?” Johnson has made clear that he would not put the Senate aid package on the floor in its current form. But he may feel pressure to articulate a plan in order to head off potential Republican support for a so-called discharge petition, a procedural maneuver that allows 218 lawmakers who sign on to a petition to force a House floor vote. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would not say whether he would support such a petition, but emphasized at a news conference Wednesday, “Mike Johnson simply needs to put the bipartisan national security bill on the House floor for an up or down vote. And it will pass. That’s it.” Biden speaks in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 13, in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Related article Biden accuses Trump of bowing to Putin by encouraging Russia to invade NATO allies that don’t meet their obligations When pressed again if that meant he would force the bill on the floor if Johnson does not act, Jeffries said, “We support an up-or-down vote, and we’ll work hard to make sure that happens sooner rather than later.” “The Republican are either going to stand with America’s national security or continue to stand with Vladimir Putin,” he added. But so far, Republican are signalling they’re not interested in that option. Wagner and Bacon both dismissed the idea. “I don’t believe that signing a discharge petition — a Democrat-led discharge petition — that’d be like voting against the rule, which I just think is, I know some in our party do that now, but I — that’s just not how I think we should comport ourselves,” Wagner said, adding that she supports bifurcating the package. “Not now,” Bacon told CNN’s Manu Raju when asked about a discharge petition. “I think right now, I’m going to talk and discuss and just figure out what’s the next step and not gonna leap too far forward.” The comments underscore the uphill climb Democrat face in successfully circumventing House GOP leaders and forcing a vote on the floor. Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, another supporter of aid to Ukraine, made clear he did not support such a move. “I’ll never sign a discharge petition when we’re in the majority,” he said","['speaker',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/house-narrow-majority-democrats-flip-seat-new-york/index.html,"Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a NewYork special election will shrink it further. Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year. When Suozzi is sworn in, Republican will control 219 seats and Democrat will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republican will only be able to lose only two vote to pass legislation on party-line vote if all members are present and voting. After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former NewYork Democrat Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month , former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year. In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party. Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year. The exact size of the far right of the House Republican Conference can vary from issue to issue. A contingent of roughly a dozen hardliners staged a rebellion on the House floor last month, taking down a procedural vote to show opposition to a spending deal Johnson had reached with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The ever-shrinking margin has forced Johnson to put some bills directly onto the floor under a procedural move known as suspension of the rules as his right flank has increasingly taken to tanking rule vote on the floor in a show of protest. But that strategy compels the need for a two-thirds majority to pass bills, requiring significant Democrat support, and further alienating Johnson and the right wing of his conference. In addition to facing pressure from conservatives, Johnson must also balance the interests of more moderate members from battleground districts who are on the front lines of the majority and who will be under intense scrutiny this election season. There were 18 Republican in House districts that Biden won in 2020 – a number that is now down to 17 after the expulsion of Santos. The fate of these politically vulnerable members will be key to whether the GOP can hold on to its majority.","['republican', 'house', 'speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'overseeing', 'one', 'smallest', 'house', 'majorities', 'history', 'democrat', 'tom', 'suozzi’s', 'win', 'newyork', 'special', 'election', 'shrink', 'suozzi', 'defeated', 'republican', 'mazi', 'pilip', 'race', 'seat', 'previously', 'held', 'gop', 'rep', 'george', 'santos', 'expelled', 'congress', 'last', 'year', 'suozzi', 'sworn', 'republican', 'control', '219', 'seats', 'democrat', 'control', '213', 'breakdown', '219', '213', 'house', 'republican', 'able', 'lose', 'two', 'vote', 'pass', 'legislation', 'partyline', 'vote', 'members', 'present', 'voting', 'swearing', 'three', 'vacancies', 'house', 'newyork', 'democrat', 'rep', 'brian', 'higgins', 'resigned', 'congress', 'earlier', 'month', 'ohio', 'gop', 'rep', 'bill', 'johnson', 'resigned', 'last', 'month', 'speaker', 'kevin', 'mccarthy', 'resigned', 'end', 'last', 'year', 'addition', 'tight', 'margin', 'always', 'possibility', 'absences', 'impact', 'vote', 'math', 'razorthin', 'majority', 'presents', 'enormous', 'challenge', 'speaker', 'leaving', 'johnson', 'almost', 'room', 'error', 'navigates', 'demands', 'competing', 'wings', 'hardline', 'conservatives', 'already', 'shown', 'hold', 'major', 'sway', 'chamber', 'narrow', 'majority', 'notably', 'group', 'hardliners', 'moved', 'oust', 'mccarthy', 'speakership', 'historic', 'vote', 'last', 'year', 'exact', 'size', 'far', 'right', 'house', 'republican', 'conference', 'vary', 'issue', 'issue', 'contingent', 'roughly', 'dozen', 'hardliners', 'staged', 'rebellion', 'house', 'floor', 'last', 'month', 'taking', 'procedural', 'vote', 'show', 'opposition', 'spending', 'deal', 'johnson', 'reached', 'senate', 'majority', 'leader', 'chuck', 'schumer', 'evershrinking', 'margin', 'forced', 'johnson', 'put', 'bills', 'directly', 'onto', 'floor', 'procedural', 'move', 'known', 'suspension', 'rules', 'right', 'flank', 'increasingly', 'taken', 'tanking', 'rule', 'vote', 'floor', 'show', 'protest', 'strategy', 'compels', 'need', 'twothirds', 'majority', 'pass', 'bills', 'requiring', 'significant', 'democrat', 'support', 'alienating', 'johnson', 'right', 'wing', 'conference', 'addition', 'facing', 'pressure', 'conservatives', 'johnson', 'must', 'balance', 'interests', 'moderate', 'members', 'battleground', 'districts', 'front', 'lines', 'majority', 'intense', 'scrutiny', 'election', 'season', '18', 'republican', 'house', 'districts', 'biden', '2020', 'number', '17', 'expulsion', 'santos', 'fate', 'politically', 'vulnerable', 'members', 'key', 'whether', 'gop', 'hold', 'majority']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/threats-to-judges-increase/index.html,"The head of the US Marshals Service is sounding the alarm on a dramatic increase in the number of threats aimed at federal judges and prosecutors, telling lawmakers on Wednesday that the development “constitutes a substantial risk to our democracy.” “I’m deeply concerned with the alarming increase in threats against our judiciary and the violent nature of those threats. In the past three years, the number of threats against federal judges have more than doubled, as have threats against prosecutors and other court officials,” US Marshals Service Director Ronald Davis told a House Judiciary subcommittee. “I must state in stark terms that the current and evolving threat environment facing the judiciary constitutes a substantial risk to our democracy,” Davis added.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images/File Related article Texas woman who threatened judge overseeing Trump Mar-a-Lago case sentenced to three years in prison The number of federal judges who received serious threats rose to 457 in the fiscal year 2023 that ended in September, up from 300 the year before and 224 in fiscal 2021. The number of federal prosecutors who were targets of threats also more than doubled from 68 in fiscal 2021 to 155 in the last fiscal year, according to data from the US Marshals Service. These were threats considered serious enough to warrant an investigation by the Marshals Service, which is responsible for protecting federal judges and court staff. The threat environment has worsened amid a politically divisive time in the United States. A number of threats have been aimed at court officials connected to cases against Trump, including from a Texas woman who was recently sentenced to three years in prison after leaving three threatening voicemails for the judge in Florida who is overseeing the criminal case against the former president over his handling of classified documents. Judges overseeing court cases against Trump in NewYork , Colorado and Washington, DC , also has been threatened, according to reports and officials. Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over Trump federal election subversion case in DC, has been the subject of at least one racist threat and a swatting incident, which are dangerous prank calls made to authorities to lure them to a location under the false pretense that a crime has been committed or is in progress. Chutkan has received a significant increase in protection since being assigned Trump case last summer. In another high-profile case, a California man was charged in 2022 with attempting to kill SupremeCourt Justice Brett Kavanaugh after law enforcement arrested him near Kavanaugh’s home outside of DC with a bag containing a gun and burglary tools, according to officials.

He transitioned to the financial sector after leaving the White House, starting a Miami-based investment firm called Affinity Partners Kushner said Tuesday that he’s enjoyed having his family “out of the spotlight” after he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, saw their White House roles end after her father left office. He also said that he was “right now” committed to “my investors, to my firm, to my employees, to my partners, and that’s what I’m planning to do.” Pressed on whether he would turn down an administration job from his father-in-law if asked directly, Kushner answered “yes.” He said Trump has had “time to really reflect” on his third presidential campaign .

During Trump White House tenure, Kushner’s fingerprints were on many, if not all , of the administration’s agenda items – from the border wall and immigration to relations with China, criminal justice, trade agreements between Mexico and Canada and the United States, the Middle East and, ultimately, the White House’s coronavirus response. Kushner also headed up the White House Office of American Innovation, whose goal was to modernize government technology. Prior to working in the White House, Kushner had no political experience.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/new-york-special-election-takeaways/index.html,"Democrat Tom Suozzi is heading back to Congress after defeating Republican Mazi Pilip in the special election to replace serial fabulist and expelled former GOP Rep. George Santos . The result will further narrow the GOP’s already thin House majority and hand Biden’s party a boost as the general election campaign comes into focus. Suozzi’s success provides Biden and national Democrat with a much-needed narrative reshuffle – a bit of good news during a period when concerns over the president’s paltry poll numbers and intensifying worries over his age, or how it’s perceived by the electorate, has stoked anxieties about the likely coming rematch with former Trump . Yes, the district broke cleanly for Biden in 2020, but Democrat on Long Island had been losing there ever since – until Tuesday. Both parties poured cash into the race for NewYork’s 3rd congressional district, but Democrat’ fundraising and registration advantage combined with Suozzi’s brand – he’s spent most of the last 30 years at or around the center of Long Island politics – and a fired-up base, angry over the Santos fiasco, delivered a victory that means the House GOP will now become even harder to corral. For Pilip, who has vowed to run again in the fall, defeat meant an almost immediate rebuke from Trump, who called her a “very foolish woman” in a social media post Tuesday night. Pilip refused until the final days of the campaign to say whether she voted for Trump in 2020, though she did follow his lead in dissing a highly touted bipartisan Senate border bill – a decision that helped Suozzi tie her more tightly to the former president over the last week.

The campaign was staked on a series of issues from the beginning: immigration, inflation, Israel and abortion. Suozzi talked about reproductive rights but didn’t make it a centerpiece of his campaign. Inflation has mostly leveled out. And there was no political or policy space to speak of between the candidates who both fully backed Israel.

Here's why it matters Officials said poll sites in NewYork's Queens and Bronx would be open Tuesday despite winter weather Republican attempt to lower expectations ahead of critical NewYork special election Santos was expelled from Congress last year in a historic vote Democrat hold cash and advertising edge in NewYork special election Why NewYork Democrat are worried about Tuesday’s special election See all updates Understanding this, Pilip and Republican set about hammering Suozzi over the migrant crisis in NewYork City, claiming he caused it along with Biden – a line that ultimately didn’t quite wash with voter who have long recognized Suozzi as a moderate or centrist. When Pilip suggested he was in league with the progressive “squad,” Suozzi at their debate was prepared. “For you to suggest I’m a member of the squad,” he said, “is about as believable as you being a member of George Santos’s volleyball team.” Most notably, though, Suozzi and state Democrat leaders didn’t repeat their mistakes from 2022. They aggressively countered Pilip’s migrant message and it never felt like the issue, typically a winner for the GOP, put Suozzi on the backfoot. Redemption for top NewYork Democrat Suozzi’s win is also a major coup for the NewYork Democrat Party and its leaders, who came under heavy criticism from within over its candidates’ underwhelming performances in the 2022 midterms. Backed by lots of outside cash, new grassroots organizations, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his political operation, along with top state and local Democrat – Gov. Kathy Hochul and state party chair Jay Jacobs, specifically – the party simply could not allow the seat to slip away again. Not after the Santos mess, not with the entire country watching and the White House desperate for a win. Victory has a hundred fathers, and they all did some well-deserved peacocking on Tuesday night. If not redemption, the NewYork Democrat Party in this special election earned a reprieve. Whether it can translate what worked – with different, perhaps weaker candidates – in the fall remains to be seen. But there’s no debating, after this result, that they’ll be given every opportunity. The weather mattered Though not for exactly the reasons one might immediately expect. It snowed heavily in the tri-state area for the first time in years Tuesday, which made travel tricky, closed schools and otherwise disrupted the normal flow of an election day. Good thing then for Democrat that, unlike many Republican in thrall to Trump, they very much embrace the idea of early voting. As the storm swept through Queens and Long Island on Tuesday, Republican groups and the Pilip campaign scrambled to drive – literally in some cases – their voter to the polls. The top GOP House super PAC made hay on social media over spending a relative pittance on plows to clear roads in Republican-friendly areas. But if the snow didn’t really stick, it appears GOP rank-and-file distaste for banking vote early did. As yet unknown statistics will provide a clearer picture of what went wrong for Pilip, but the weather definitely clouded the picture. Democrat have an Israel problem There stood Suozzi, all smiles, as he prepared to begin his victory speech, when he was interrupted by protesters accusing him of aiding and abetting a “genocide” by Israel in Gaza. Then it happened again. And again. Nevermind his rival was arguably more inclined to support Israel – she was a member of the Israel Defense Forces before moving to the US, after all – in its deadly monthslong military campaign. The interruptions were as much a message to Democrat, especially Biden, as the once and now future congressman from a heavily Jewish district. Though little will be made of a brief demonstration before a speech, the anger among progressive grassroots – young voter even more so – is real, and it is not going away. It might not add up to more vote for Republican in the fall, but as things stand, it seems sure to eat away at Democrat support. And in an era of fine political margins, that’s a problem. Don’t take away too much This race was always going to take on national significance, both because of the stakes in the House and the makeup of the electorate, which is largely similar to suburban swing districts in presidential battleground states. But Democrat would be wise to remember that Suozzi was a unique – and uniquely talented – candidate with deep ties across Nassau County, where most of the voter reside. A former mayor, he became the first Democrat elected to the county’s top job in more than three decades when he won it in 2002. After losing his bid for a third term and some time away, he returned to become a congressman – winning the seat three times, including a defeat of Santos in 2020, before leaving for a failed gubernatorial bid in 2022. Simply stated, Suozzi had a record, and for all the ads launched against him, voter in the district knew who he was – a moderate who courts labor and will aggressively push for the return of the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, that just about everyone on Long Island wants back after Republican jettisoned it as part of their 2017 tax cuts. It also remains to be seen how exactly the district-wide vote broke down. Suozzi appears to have exceeded expectations in Queens – a diverse borough of NewYork City and not a suburb – which could yet mean the town helped him as much as the country. Pilip, on the other hand, was a relative unknown going into the race and a relative unknown coming out of it. A county legislator, she made precious few public appearances, held a handful of notable events outside the district, and seemed unsure of how to position herself in relation to Trump.","['democrat',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/santos-seat-tom-suozzi-mazi-pilip/index.html,"Democrat former Rep. Tom Suozzi will win a high-stakes special election in NewYork to succeed disgraced Republican George Santos, a result that will further shrink the House GOP’s narrow majority and provide Biden and his allies a morale boost as the general election campaign kicks into gear. While Suozzi’s win over Republican Mazi Pilip , who conceded the race less than 90 minutes after polls closed, won’t affect control of the House, the result nevertheless has major implications for the GOP, whose margin for error in the House will shrink further when Suozzi takes office, leaving them with only two vote to spare on any partisan measure – most notably a coming clash over government spending. The special election for the Long Island- and Queens-based 3rd Congressional District could also serve as a bellwether for other suburban races this fall. Republican flipped several House seats across the NewYork City suburbs in 2022, including the 3rd District, and the state is once again poised to be a focal point in the battle for control of Congress. The central issues in the special election — including immigration, abortion rights, the Israel-Hamas war and the candidates’ postures toward both Biden and former Trump — could also define this year’s general election. Suozzi’s tactic of aggressively engaging with GOP attacks, in particular the city’s migrant crisis and anxieties over it in Long Island, could also provide a playbook for Biden and other Democrat banking on victories among similar electorates in the fall. Suozzi didn’t shy away from the national stakes in his speech to supporters Tuesday night, referencing Trump successful effort to torpedo a bipartisan border bill on Capitol Hill. “Let’s send a message to our friends running the Congress these days,” Suozzi said. “Stop running around for Trump and start running the country.” Biden reelection campaign was also quick to tie Republican’ failure in Long Island to the former president, saying in a statement, “Trump lost again tonight.” Campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez also made a point of connecting GOP dysfunction on the border legislation to the outcome in NewYork. “Trump and the MAGA extremists in the House are already paying the political price for derailing a bipartisan deal to secure our borders and fix our broken immigration system,” Chavez Rodriguez said. The 61-year-old Suozzi has been a long-term fixture in local Nassau County politics. A moderate, he previously served as Glen Cove mayor and Nassau County executive, before representing an earlier version of the 3rd District for three terms. He vacated the seat in 2022 for an ultimately unsuccessful bid for governor, and Santos ended up flipping the district that fall. Supporters of Tom Suozzi celebrate as they watch vote counting on a screen during his election night party in Woodbury, NewYork, on February 13. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters Pilip, 44, is a Nassau County legislator who was making her first bid for federal office. An Israeli immigrant, she was born in Ethiopia and served in the Israel Defense Forces. Under NewYork’s special election rules, both nominees were selected by county party leaders in the district. In December, Santos became only the sixth lawmaker to be expelled from Congress , bringing to an end a scandal-plagued and tumultuous tenure on Capitol Hill. He has pleaded not guilty to 23 federal charges , including allegations that he stole donors’ identities and ran up thousands of dollars in fraudulent charges on their credit cards, misused campaign funds and lied about his personal finances on House disclosure reports. He faces a possible trial later this year. With his victory in the special election, Suozzi will serve out the remainder of Santos’ term, which ends in January. The primary for the regular full term will be held in June. But the district’s boundaries beyond the special election remain uncertain, as NewYork’s highest court has ordered the state to redraw its congressional map this year . The state’s Democrat-controlled Legislature would have ultimate say over the new lines ","['democrat', 'rep', 'tom', 'suozzi', 'win', 'highstakes', 'special', 'election', 'newyork', 'succeed', 'disgraced', 'republican', 'george', 'santos', 'result', 'shrink', 'house', 'gop’s', 'narrow', 'majority', 'provide', 'biden', 'allies', 'morale', 'boost', 'general', 'election', 'campaign', 'kicks', 'gear', 'suozzi’s', 'win', 'republican', 'mazi', 'pilip', 'conceded', 'race', 'less', '90', 'minutes', 'polls', 'closed', 'won’t', 'affect', 'control', 'house', 'result', 'nevertheless', 'major', 'implications', 'gop', 'whose', 'margin', 'error', 'house', 'shrink', 'suozzi', 'takes', 'office', 'leaving', 'two', 'vote', 'spare', 'partisan', 'measure', 'notably', 'coming', 'clash', 'government', 'spending', 'special', 'election', 'long', 'island', 'queensbased', '3rd', 'congressional', 'district', 'serve', 'bellwether', 'suburban', 'races', 'fall', 'republican', 'flipped', 'several', 'house', 'seats', 'across', 'newyork', 'city', 'suburbs', '2022', 'including', '3rd', 'district', 'state', 'poised', 'focal', 'point', 'battle', 'control', 'congress', 'central', 'issues', 'special', 'election', 'including', 'immigration', 'abortion', 'rights', 'israelhamas', 'war', 'candidates’', 'postures', 'toward', 'biden', 'trump', 'define', 'year’s', 'general', 'election', 'suozzi’s', 'tactic', 'aggressively', 'engaging', 'gop', 'attacks', 'particular', 'city’s', 'migrant', 'crisis', 'anxieties', 'long', 'island', 'provide', 'playbook', 'biden', 'democrat', 'banking', 'victories', 'among', 'similar', 'electorates', 'fall', 'suozzi', 'didn’t', 'shy', 'away', 'national', 'stakes', 'speech', 'supporters', 'tuesday', 'night', 'referencing', 'trump', 'successful', 'effort', 'torpedo', 'bipartisan', 'border', 'bill', 'capitol', 'hill', '“let’s', 'send', 'message', 'friends', 'running', 'congress', 'days”', 'suozzi', '“stop', 'running', 'around', 'trump', 'start', 'running', 'country”', 'biden', 'reelection', 'campaign', 'quick', 'tie', 'republican’', 'failure', 'long', 'island', 'president', 'saying', 'statement', '“trump', 'lost', 'tonight”', 'campaign', 'manager', 'julie', 'chavez', 'rodriguez', 'made', 'point', 'connecting', 'gop', 'dysfunction', 'border', 'legislation', 'outcome', 'newyork', '“trump', 'maga', 'extremists', 'house', 'already', 'paying', 'political', 'price', 'derailing', 'bipartisan', 'deal', 'secure', 'borders', 'fix', 'broken', 'immigration', 'system”', 'chavez', 'rodriguez', '61yearold', 'suozzi', 'longterm', 'fixture', 'local', 'nassau', 'county', 'politics', 'moderate', 'previously', 'served', 'glen', 'cove', 'mayor', 'nassau', 'county', 'executive', 'representing', 'earlier', 'version', '3rd', 'district', 'three', 'terms', 'vacated', 'seat', '2022', 'ultimately', 'unsuccessful', 'bid', 'governor', 'santos', 'ended', 'flipping', 'district', 'fall', 'supporters', 'tom', 'suozzi', 'celebrate', 'watch', 'vote', 'counting', 'screen', 'election', 'night', 'woodbury', 'newyork', 'february', '13', 'eduardo', 'munozreuters', 'pilip', '44', 'nassau', 'county', 'legislator', 'making', 'first', 'bid', 'federal', 'office', 'israeli', 'immigrant', 'born', 'ethiopia', 'served', 'israel', 'defense', 'forces', 'newyork’s', 'special', 'election', 'rules', 'nominees', 'selected', 'county', 'leaders', 'district', 'december', 'santos', 'became', 'sixth', 'lawmaker', 'expelled', 'congress', 'bringing', 'end', 'scandalplagued', 'tumultuous', 'tenure', 'capitol', 'hill', 'pleaded', 'guilty', '23', 'federal', 'charges', 'including', 'allegations', 'stole', 'donors’', 'identities', 'ran', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'fraudulent', 'charges', 'credit', 'cards', 'misused', 'campaign', 'funds', 'lied', 'personal', 'finances', 'house', 'disclosure', 'reports', 'faces', 'possible', 'trial', 'later', 'year', 'victory', 'special', 'election', 'suozzi', 'serve', 'remainder', 'santos’', 'term', 'ends', 'january', 'primary', 'regular', 'full', 'term', 'held', 'june', 'district’s', 'boundaries', 'beyond', 'special', 'election', 'remain', 'uncertain', 'newyork’s', 'highest', 'court', 'ordered', 'state', 'redraw', 'congressional', 'map', 'year', 'state’s', 'democratcontrolled', 'legislature', 'ultimate', 'say', 'new', 'lines', '']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/menendez-bribery-scheme-new-filing/index.html,"Nadine Menendez, wife of New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez , got a diamond engagement ring as part of extensive bribes the couple received in exchange for the senator’s influence, according to a new filing from prosecutors. The ring was purchased for Nadine Menendez as part of a $150,000 bribe for her husband’s intervention in a criminal insurance fraud prosecution, prosecutors said in the Monday filing. Part of the money was used to purchase a Mercedes-Benz convertible for Nadine Menendez, and one of the co-defendants in the case, businessman Wael Hana, purchased the ring for her but kept some of the money for himself, prosecutors allege. Prosecutors claim Hana facilitated an agreement to provide bribes to the couple in exchange for the senator’s influence on matters benefiting himself, the Egyptian government and others. A confidential source communicating with Egypt was seemingly worried about Hana keeping some of the money and said “Wail [Hana] was about to ruin things with Bob. Bob who is starting to listen to us,” according to the new filing. “This complaint—that the failure to deliver the full amount of the promised bribe would harm Menendez’s relationship with Egypt—obviously does not undermine the conclusion that Menendez was in a corrupt relationship for the benefit of Egypt,” prosecutors wrote. “It is instead strong proof that he was.” Menendez and his wife have pleaded not guilty to the charges, as have Hana and two other co-defendants. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Bob Menendez, Nadine Menendez and another co-defendant for comment. An attorney for Hana told CNN he has no comment at this time but will file a response to the government’s motion. Prosecutors also shared more details about the cash investigators found in the basement of the Menendez home, noting that in addition to two bags of approximately $100,000 found on top of a large rack of clothes hangers, prosecutors found four boots “stuffed with cash, including one boot containing in excess of $5,000 in $50 bills, marked with a note stating ‘5350.’” Prosecutors also said Menendez contacted New Jersey mayors in late 2020 and early 2021 “seeking to convince them to authorize the Laboratory Company—a company that was paying Nadine Menendez—to conduct COVID-19 testing,” according to the filing. Prosecutors said Menendez called his wife in January 2019 on her alternate cellphone, “a phone Menendez and Nadine Menendez referred to as her ‘007’ phone, an apparent reference to the fictional character James Bond,” according to the Monday filing. The call was made “before Nadine Menendez requested and received from Hana briefing information about the New Jersey Defendant’s case,” prosecutors wrote. Investigators found “extensive test messages” between Nadine Menendez and another co-defendant in the case. One text asked Nadine to “make things go away,” and prosecutors say she represented that her husband would intervene, according to the filing. There was “substantial evidence that Menendez did in fact know about the corrupt quid pro quo,” prosecutors wrote in the filing.","['nadine', 'menendez', 'wife', 'new', 'jersey', 'sen', 'bob', 'menendez', 'got', 'diamond', 'engagement', 'ring', 'part', 'extensive', 'bribes', 'couple', 'received', 'exchange', 'senator’s', 'influence', 'according', 'new', 'filing', 'prosecutors', 'ring', 'purchased', 'nadine', 'menendez', 'part', '150000', 'bribe', 'husband’s', 'intervention', 'criminal', 'insurance', 'fraud', 'prosecution', 'prosecutors', 'monday', 'filing', 'part', 'money', 'used', 'purchase', 'mercedesbenz', 'convertible', 'nadine', 'menendez', 'one', 'codefendants', 'case', 'businessman', 'wael', 'hana', 'purchased', 'ring', 'kept', 'money', 'prosecutors', 'allege', 'prosecutors', 'claim', 'hana', 'facilitated', 'agreement', 'provide', 'bribes', 'couple', 'exchange', 'senator’s', 'influence', 'matters', 'benefiting', 'egyptian', 'government', 'others', 'confidential', 'source', 'communicating', 'egypt', 'seemingly', 'worried', 'hana', 'keeping', 'money', '“wail', 'hana', 'ruin', 'things', 'bob', 'bob', 'starting', 'listen', 'us”', 'according', 'new', 'filing', '“this', 'complaint—that', 'failure', 'deliver', 'full', 'amount', 'promised', 'bribe', 'harm', 'menendez’s', 'relationship', 'egypt—obviously', 'undermine', 'conclusion', 'menendez', 'corrupt', 'relationship', 'benefit', 'egypt”', 'prosecutors', 'wrote', '“it', 'instead', 'strong', 'proof', 'was”', 'menendez', 'wife', 'pleaded', 'guilty', 'charges', 'hana', 'two', 'codefendants', 'reached', 'attorneys', 'bob', 'menendez', 'nadine', 'menendez', 'another', 'codefendant', 'comment', 'attorney', 'hana', 'comment', 'file', 'response', 'government’s', 'motion', 'prosecutors', 'shared', 'details', 'cash', 'investigators', 'found', 'basement', 'menendez', 'home', 'noting', 'addition', 'two', 'bags', 'approximately', '100000', 'found', 'top', 'large', 'rack', 'clothes', 'hangers', 'prosecutors', 'found', 'four', 'boots', '“stuffed', 'cash', 'including', 'one', 'boot', 'containing', 'excess', '5000', '50', 'bills', 'marked', 'note', 'stating', '‘5350’”', 'prosecutors', 'menendez', 'contacted', 'new', 'jersey', 'mayors', 'late', '2020', 'early', '2021', '“seeking', 'convince', 'authorize', 'laboratory', 'company—a', 'company', 'paying', 'nadine', 'menendez—to', 'conduct', 'covid19', 'testing”', 'according', 'filing', 'prosecutors', 'menendez', 'called', 'wife', 'january', '2019', 'alternate', 'cellphone', '“a', 'phone', 'menendez', 'nadine', 'menendez', 'referred', '‘007’', 'phone', 'apparent', 'reference', 'fictional', 'character', 'james', 'bond”', 'according', 'monday', 'filing', 'call', 'made', '“before', 'nadine', 'menendez', 'requested', 'received', 'hana', 'briefing', 'information', 'new', 'jersey', 'defendant’s', 'case”', 'prosecutors', 'wrote', 'investigators', 'found', '“extensive', 'test', 'messages”', 'nadine', 'menendez', 'another', 'codefendant', 'case', 'one', 'text', 'asked', 'nadine', '“make', 'things', 'go', 'away”', 'prosecutors', 'say', 'represented', 'husband', 'intervene', 'according', 'filing', '“substantial', 'evidence', 'menendez', 'fact', 'know', 'corrupt', 'quid', 'pro', 'quo”', 'prosecutors', 'wrote', 'filing']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/senate-foreign-aid-bill-ukraine/index.html,"The Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine and Israel in a vote early Tuesday morning, setting up a showdown with the House as Speaker Mike Johnson has said he does not plan to bring the bill to the floor. The foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine, among other priorities. The US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024. Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article How each member of the Senate voted on foreign aid package The bill passed the Senate despite Johnson’s criticism of the legislation and former Trump signaling opposition to the bill by arguing the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is in the form of a loan. The Senate vote was 70 to 29 with 22 Republican voting in favor, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “History settles every account,” McConnell said in a statement following the vote. “And today, on the value of American leadership and strength, history will record that the Senate did not blink.” The bill includes $60 billion to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia, $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel, $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance and $4.8 billion to support regional partners in the Indo-Pacific region in addition to other policy provisions, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Johnson told reporters on Tuesday that he is not planning to put the package on the House floor, setting up a major clash between the two chambers. “I certainly don’t,” Johnson said when asked if he plans to put the bill on the floor. “Right now, we’re dealing with the appropriations process, we have immediate deadlines upon us and that’s where the attention is in the House in this moment.” Biden called on House Republican to hold a vote on the bill in remarks from the White House, saying that a “minority of the most extreme voices in the House,” should not be permitted to block the bill. The president issued a stark warning, cautioning that if lawmakers fail to act, Russian President Vladimir Putin, “won’t limit himself just to Ukraine, and the costs for America and our allies and partners are going to rise.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Schumer, McConnell and “every US Senator who has supported continued assistance to Ukraine as we fight for freedom, democracy, and the values we all hold dear” in a statement Tuesday. “For us in Ukraine, continued US assistance helps to save human lives from Russian terror. It means that life will continue in our cities and will triumph over war,” Zelensky said on X. “American assistance brings just peace in Ukraine closer and restores global stability, resulting in increased security and prosperity for all Americans and all the free world.” Bill faces Johnson’s opposition in the House The Senate passed the legislation after Republican blocked a broader bill last week that would have combined foreign aid with a bipartisan border deal. Republican had initially demanded that border security be part of the bill, but went on to reject the bipartisan border deal amid forceful attacks on the measure by Trump and top House Republican. In a statement on Monday, Johnson criticized the foreign aid bill over its lack of border provisions, saying, the Senate “should have gone back to the drawing board to amend the current bill to include real border security provisions that would actually help end the ongoing catastrophe.” Johnson had previously opposed the broader bill that did include border provisions. The speaker has characterized those provisions as insufficient, despite the fact that they were the product of bipartisan negotiations and included restrictive border measures. “The House will have to figure out a path forward and they’ll have to do it their way, but we needed to start the process and we’ve done that,” Senate GOP Whip John Thune told reporters on Tuesday. House Republican debated several ideas to change the Senate-passed foreign aid package during a closed-door party meeting Tuesday night, including paring back money to Ukraine, multiple attendees told CNN. An option that was discussed during the House GOP whips meeting was stripping the aid package of its humanitarian assistance and only including military aid for Ukraine, with the thinking that it could be more palatable to the Republican conference. Another idea was incorporating some of the funding into portions of an upcoming annual spending bill for the Pentagon. No decisions have made been, however, and the issue is expected to be a topic of conversation at Wednesday’s larger House GOP conference meeting. While Johnson has made clear that he would not put the Senate aid passage on the floor in its current form, he may feel pressure to articulate a plan in order to head off potential Republican support for a so-called discharge petition. House Democrat Leader Hakeem Jeffries vowed to use “every available legislative tool to get comprehensive national security legislation over the finish line” in a letter to colleagues. Democrat are limited in their options, however, if Johnson does not bring the bill to the floor. Democrat would need to get the support of a majority of the House — or 218 members when every seat is filled — to sign on to an effort to circumvent GOP leadership and force a floor vote. That effort, known on Capitol Hill as a discharge petition, rarely succeeds and would be difficult to pull off. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer celebrated passage of the legislation, saying in remarks on the floor, “It’s been years, perhaps decades, since the Senate passed a bill that so greatly impacts not just our national security, not just the security of our allies, but the security of western democracy.” “I believe that if Speaker Johnson brought this bill to the House floor, it will pass with the same strong bipartisan support,” Schumer said. Trump stance on foreign aid looms The Senate continued to move forward on the bill even as Trump argued the US should not grant foreign aid unless it is a loan, signaling opposition to the legislation. Trump has also indicated he would encourage Russian aggression against any NATO member country that doesn’t pay enough. A number of Senate Republican either defended or downplayed Trump NATO comments on Monday. “I’m 100% behind him,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville said of Trump saying NATO members should be paying their dues or risk Putin invading their country. The Alabama Republican also suggested European allies should be “very worried” about an invasion, saying they should protect themselves and not rely on the US, adding the country “can’t protect everybody.” Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said European allies who are worried about Trump comments need to “get over it.” “You know, they need to get over it. They need to stand up and be tough. We need to secure our own border first. We need to take care of things here at home first. When we secure our own border, when we take care of home, great. Let’s help other people as well,” the Republican from Kansas said. In the Senate, consideration of the bill crawled along for days as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky vowed to drag out the timeline in protest over the legislation. Paul continued to dig in on Sunday, saying that he will hold out until “hell freezes over.” He indicated he is ready to hold the floor by speaking on the issue of national debt and other matters. “I love to talk. That’s one of my favorite things to do,” he said. “We do this for a purpose,” Paul said. “I don’t like being here","['senate', 'passed', '953', 'billion', 'foreign', 'aid', 'bill', 'assistance',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-intel-chair-turner-issues-vague-warning-on-serious-national-security-threat-urges-biden-to-declasify,"Biden's 'weaponizing of the word ""democracy""' undermines US national security: Morgan Ortagus Former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus reacts to the president's push for the $95B Senate foreign aid bill without border funding on 'America Reports.' House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner is urging Biden to declassify information related to a ""serious national security threat. However, House Speaker Mike Johnson says the threat is not immediate, and there is ""no need for public alarm."" Turner, R-Ohio, on Wednesday morning released a statement saying that ""the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has made available to all Members of Congress information concerning a serious national security threat."" ""I am requesting that Biden declassify all information relating to this threat so that Congress, the Administration, and our allies can openly discuss the actions necessary to respond to this threat,"" he added. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio. Fox News Digital obtained the notice sent to congressional members Wednesday, which pointed to ""an urgent matter with regard to a destabilizing foreign military capability that should be known by all Congressional Policy Makers."" A separate source told Fox News that the threat is ""concerning Russian capability,"" noting that the ""potential seriousness of the threat is grave,"" but ""the threat is not immediate in nature."" And a Pentagon source told Fox News the threat is related to space. Johnson, R-La., attempted to quell any panic caused by Turner's statement by explaining that last month, he sent a letter to the White House ""requesting a meeting with the president to discuss a serious national security issue that is classified."" ""In response to that letter, a meeting is now scheduled tomorrow on this matter here at the Capitol with the Gang of Four and with the president's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan,"" Johnson said. ""I will press the administration to take appropriate action, and everybody can be comforted by that."" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Johnson said he ""saw Chairman Turner's statement on the issue, and I want to assure the American people there's no need for public alarm."" ""We are going to work together to address this matter as we do all sensitive matters that are classified,"" Johnson said. ""And beyond that, I'm not at liberty to disclose classified information and really can't say much of that, but we just want to assure everyone, steady hands are at the wheel, we're working on it. There's no need for alarm."" Biden'S MEMORY STRUGGLES COULD IMPERIL NATIONAL SECURITY, DEFENSE EXPERTS WARN: 'NOT ONLY WEAK BUT CONFUSED' Turner's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment and more information. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday at the White House press briefing that he was surprised by Turner's statement, given that earlier in the week he reached out to members of Congress to offer himself to come to Capitol Hill to give a personal briefing on the matter. That briefing will take place on Thursday. ""I am a bit surprised that Congressman Turner came out publicly today in advance of a meeting on the books for me to go sit with him alongside our intelligence and defense professionals tomorrow. That’s his choice to do that,"" Sullivan said. ""All I can tell you is that I’m focused on going to see him, sit with him, as well as the other House members of the Gang of Eight tomorrow, and I’m not in a position to say anything further from this podium at this time, other than to make the broad point that this administration has gone further, and in more creative, more strategic ways, dealt with the declassification of intelligence in the national interest of the United States than any administration in history,"" Sullivan continued. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan speaks during a news conference in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 13, 2023. Sullivan added: ""You definitely are not going to find an unwillingness to do that when it’s in our national security interest to do so."" Sullivan said, however, the administration has prioritized ""the issue of sources and methods."" ""Ultimately, these are decisions for the president to make, but in the meantime, the most important thing is we have the opportunity to sit in a classified setting and have the kind of conversation with the House Intelligence leadership that I, in fact, had scheduled before Congressman Turner went out today,"" Sullivan said. ""It is highly unusual, in fact, for the national security adviser to do that,"" he said. Meanwhile, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., and Vice Chairman Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said their committee ""has the intelligence in question, and has been rigorously tracking this issue from the start."" ""We continue to take this matter seriously and are discussing an appropriate response with the administration,"" Warner and Rubio said. ""In the meantime, we must be cautious about potentially disclosing sources and methods that may be key to preserving a range of options for U.S","['bidens', 'weaponizing', 'word', 'democracy',

""She's vice president of the United States,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said when asked if Harris was ready to serve as president. ""She better be."" Vice President Harris ""better be"" ready to serve as president if called upon, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told Fox News on Wednesday. CONGRESS FACES 'EXISTENTIAL MOMENT' OVER $95 BILLION FOREIGN AID BILL: DEM REPRESENTATIVE The NewYork Democrat added that Harris has been ""doing a solid job as vice president"" and a major part of her constitutional responsibility is ""to stand at the ready."" Special Counsel Robert Hur, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, released an investigative report last week recommending no charges against Biden for his actions related to mishandling classified documents, partly due to the president's potential defense at trial as a ""sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" The assertion led to increased scrutiny over Biden's age and mental abilities, particularly among Republican, but Harris said she was ""ready to serve"" during an interview ahead of the report's release. ""I am ready to serve. There’s no question about that,"" Harris told The Wall Street Journal , adding that everyone who observes her work ""walks away fully aware of my capacity to lead."" Video WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Texas, said the vice president's comments exacerbated concerns about the current commander in chief . ""What's scary is that she is basically admitting that he is not able to serve,"" the Texas Republican told Fox News on Wednesday. ""Look, we don't need four more years of Biden, and we certainly don't need one day of President Harris."" Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., said a Harris administration ""would be an unmitigated disaster."" ""It's two of the most clueless people that have ever been in the executive office,"" Palmer told Fox News. Vice President Harris said in an interview last week that she's ""ready to serve"" as commander-in-chief if called upon. ‘HE’S DELUSIONAL': Biden'S BORDER COMMENTS SPARK STIFF REBUKE ON CAPITOL HILL FROM SOME LAWMAKERS Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., said America has already ""seen the results of the vice president's version of serving."" ""As the border czar, she's done a terrible job and I have no confidence that she will do any better doing anything else,"" the Arizona Republican said. Rep. Austin Scott, a Republican from Georgia, said he doesn't ""know what she's ready for."" ""She doesn't seem to even make a coherent statement,"" Scott said. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., said the results of Harris' leadership are already clear at the southern border. ""She's done a terrible job"" as border czar, he told Fox News on Tuesday.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/haley-blames-trump-gop-loss-key-special-election-south-carolina-showdown-intensifies,"Democrat Tom Suozzi defeats Republican Mazi Pilip Fox News' Trace Gallagher reports on the outcome of NewYork's special election. Tuesday night's setback for the GOP in a closely watched special congressional election in the suburbs of NewYork City armed Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley with more ammunition against commanding frontrunner, former Trump. ""Let’s just say the quiet part out loud. Trump continues to be a huge weight against Republican candidates,"" Haley campaign national spokesperson Olvia Perez-Cubas argued in a statement. ""Despite the enormous and obvious failings of Biden, we just lost another winnable Republican House seat because voter overwhelmingly reject Trump."" Perez-Cubas claimed that ""until Republican wake up, we will continue to lose. Time for a new generation of conservative leadership that doesn’t turn off the American people."" Trump RIPS BLACK FEMALE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHO LOST KEY SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION Pointing to GOP setbacks in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections, Haley has long made the argument that Republican are tired of losing under Trump a key part of her campaign trail stump speech. She has been campaigning in SouthCarolina, where she was a two-term governor before joining the Trump administration as ambassador to the U.N. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley waves to a crowd during a campaign event at New Realm Brewing Co. in Charleston, SouthCarolina, on Feb. 4. In the special election, former Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi defeated GOP county lawmaker Mazi Pilip to fill a vacant House seat once held by former Republican Rep. George Santos , who was expelled from the chamber in December. Trump returns to SouthCarolina on Wednesday to hold a rally in North Charleston with 10 days to go until the state's Republican presidential primary. After double-digit victories in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, and landslide wins in Nevada and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the former president is moving closer to locking up the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. Polls suggest he holds a very large double-digit lead in the latest public opinion polls in the Palmetto State over Haley, his last remaining major rival. Haley, as she faces a steep uphill climb to upset Trump, has been turning up the volume on her attacks on the former president in recent weeks. On Tuesday, her campaign launched a new TV ad emphasizing the ""chaos"" that will ensue if Trump returns to the White House. Haley is also reiterating her claims that Trump is ""unhinged."" DEMS FLIP SEAT AS SUOZZI WINS CRUCIAL SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION IN NEW YORK Republican congressional candidate Mazi Pilip, a Nassau County lawmaker, speaks to supporters after conceding the NY-03 special election to former Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi in East Meadow, NewYork, on Tuesday. With the GOP hanging on to a razor-thin majority in the House, national Republican and Democrat poured big bucks into a race where immigration and border security , crime and abortion were the top issues, and where the election was seen as a bellwether ahead of the all-but-certain November White House rematch between Trump and Biden. The Long Island district, held for a decade by Democrat, was flipped by Santos in the 2022 midterms. However, Santos was kicked out of Congress less than a year into his tenure, after he was exposed for lying about his background and indicted for a slew of financial crimes. Suozzi, who represented the district for six years before running unsuccessfully for governor, repeatedly tied Pilip to Santos, as well as to Trump. With the Republican majority in the House slipping to 219-213 once Suozzi is sworn in, the pickup by the Democrat now puts the GOP's grip on the chamber further in peril. Pilip, an Ethiopian Jew who fled to Israel at age 12 to escape persecution and later enlisted and served in the Israeli military before immigrating to the U.S., was a former Democrat who argued the party ""left me and many others"" She repeatedly tied Suozzi to Biden and blamed her opponent for the migrant crisis. While Pilip was praised by Nassau County Republican on Tuesday evening after her defeat, Trump slammed her in a late night social media posting, calling her a ""foolish woman"" and claiming she lost on Tuesday because she did not endorse him. Trump arrives onstage during a Get Out the Vote rally at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, SouthCarolina, on Saturday. ""Republican just don’t learn, but maybe she was still a Democrat? I have an almost 99% Endorsement Success Rate in Primaries, and a very good number in the General Elections, as well, but just watched this very foolish woman, Mazi Melesa Pilip, running in a race where she didn’t endorse me and tried to 'straddle the fence,' when she would have easily WON if she understood anything about MODERN DAY politics in America,"" Trump argued on his Truth Social platform. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Trump. Haley has been campaigning vigorously in her home state and kicked off a bus tour this past weekend. However, she is heading to Texas on Thursday and Friday for fundraisers and to campaign in one of the 15 states holding Republican nominating contests on Super Tuesday in early March. Haley raised money and campaigned last week in California, another large Super Tuesday state. The swings through Texas and California appear in part to be a marker for Haley as she pushes back against calls by some Republican to drop out of the race and allow Trump to focus on facing off with Biden in November.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-of-the-2024-republican-primary-where-the-race-stands,"Nikki Haley fires back at 'The View': 'I've done quite a bit' 2024 GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley says she is fighting for every American's vote on 'America Reports.' Trump jumped into the fray this week after former Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi won a closely watched special election for a vacant House seat once held by former Republican Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from the chamber in December. Trump slammed Republican candidate Mazi Pilip after she lost to Suozzi, claiming it was because she did not endorse him. Meanwhile, Trump and his GOP primary rival Nikki Haley have their eyes on the next major contest on the 2024 Republican nominating calendar — Haley’s home state of SouthCarolina. Here's a snapshot of where the battle to lead the Republican Party stands. GOP DELEGATE COUNT AFTER NEVADA: Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Trump. DEMOCRAT DELEGATE COUNT AFTER NEVADA: Biden and Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn. ONE NEW VICTORY LAP: Former Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi won the NewYork special election against Republican county lawmaker Mazi Pilip. Suozzi, speaking at his victory celebration, emphasized that ""despite all the attacks and despite all the lies about Tom Suozzi and the squad, about Tom Suozzi being the godfather of the migrant crisis, about Sanctuary Suozzi, despite the dirty tricks, despite the vaunted Nassau County Republican machine, we won."" ONE NEW SLAM: Former Trump blasted Pilip after she lost the special election to Suozzi. In a late night Truth Social post, Trump called Pilip a ""foolish woman"" and claimed she lost because she did not endorse him. ""Republican just don’t learn, but maybe she was still a Democrat? I have an almost 99% Endorsement Success Rate in Primaries, and a very good number in the General Elections, as well, but just watched this very foolish woman, Mazi Melesa Pilip, running in a race where she didn’t endorse me and tried to 'straddle the fence,' when she would have easily WON if she understood anything about MODERN DAY politics in America,"" Trump wrote. ONE NEW ENDORSEMENT: Trump announced his recommendations for changes within the Republican National Committee, proposing leadership positions for North Carolina GOP chair Michael Whatley, daughter-in-law Lara Trump and campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita. Trump officially announced that he believes Whatley, who currently serves as the national party committee's general counsel, should be the RNC’s next leader, and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump should run as co-chair of the RNC. He'd also like to see veteran Republican strategist LaCivita, who's a top adviser in Trump's 2024 campaign, as the committee's chief operating officer. ONE NEW AD BUY: Former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy's campaign is dropping six-figures to promote his coveted Senate endorsement from Trump with a new ad buy across the Big Sky State. Trump announced last week he was endorsing Sheehy in the crucial Montana Senate race to unseat Democrat Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. The announcement came just hours after Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., also announced his candidacy for the primary race. ONE NEW POLL: A large majority of Americans believe both Biden and former Trump are too old to serve another term in the White House. Eighty-six percent of Americans think Biden, 81, is too old to serve another term as president, while 62% think the same of Trump, 77, according to the results of a new ABC News/Ipsos poll.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mike-pences-think-tank-rebuts-jd-vances-impeachment-time-bomb-claim-foreign-aid-package,"Biden on $95 billion aid package to Ukraine: 'Opposing this is playing into Putin's hands' Biden delivers remarks in support of a $95 billion aid package recently passed by the Senate. FIRST ON FOX: Former Vice President Mike Pence's policy think tank, Advancing American Freedom, sent a memo to senators Wednesday pushing back against Sen. JD Vance's theory that the $95 billion foreign aid package contains an ""impeachment"" clause for the next administration hidden in its text. AAF's memo comes after Vance circulated a memo ahead of the national security supplemental package vote Monday arguing the bill includes a provision that could be grounds to impeach former Trump if he wins the White House again. The text assures the delivery of $1.6 billion to finance Ukraine's military as well as just under $14 billion for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative through Sept. 30, 2025 – the same aid mechanism that Trump temporarily paused while pushing for an investigation into Biden family foreign business dealings. ""The president’s duty to faithfully execute the law is written into the Constitution,"" AAF's memo reads. ""It’s not an ‘impeachment time bomb’ created by the foreign aid package."" A spokesperson for Vance told Fox News Digital that the AAF memo repeated talking points circulated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a long-time advocate of aid to Ukraine. ""It's unfortunate to see Mike Pence adopting Mitch McConnell's talking points and advocating for a bill that would tie the next president's hands on Ukraine. Their America Last foreign policy has been rejected by Republican voter,"" the spokesperson said. SENATOR PAUL ASSERTS UKRAINE AID PACKAGE WOULD 'TIE THE HANDS' OF FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS Former Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the Republican Party of Iowa's annual Lincoln Dinner in Des Moines on July 28, 2023. According to the memo, AAF argues that the Constitution mandates the president to faithfully execute laws, rejecting attempts from lawmakers to interpret this as permission to ignore statutes. The Impoundment Control Act ensures Congress controls funding, requiring presidential notification and approval for cuts within a 45-day timeframe. Congress wields the power of the purse, the AAF memo states, despite changes in administrations. Former Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the Republican Party of Iowa's annual Lincoln Dinner in Des Moines on July 28, 2023. "" Congress routinely appropriates funds across presidential terms,"" the memo reads. ""Following the argument to its logical conclusion, all advance appropriations are ‘impeachment time bombs.’"" ""The Trump-Pence administration sold weapons to Ukraine that the Obama-Biden administration refused to,"" the memo continued. ""It also countered Putin’s influence by blocking Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Biden green-lighted."" Meanwhile, Vance's memo claimed that the supplemental bill ""represents an attempt by the foreign policy blob/deep state to stop Trump from pursuing his desired policy, and if he does so anyways, to provide grounds to impeach him and undermine his administration."" Trump has promised he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours if he is elected president. SEN. VANCE MEMO WARNS GOP COLLEAGUES OF ‘SYSTEMIC FAILURES’ IN US AID TO UKRAINE Sen. JD Vance warned his Republican colleagues that the proposed Ukraine aid bill could be used to impeach former Trump if he wins re-election in November. The Trump administration, through the Office of Management and Budget, withheld a total of about $400 million in security assistance from Ukraine in 2019. This came just before Trump asked Ukrainian President Voldomyr Zelenskyy to investigate the family of his 2020 rival, Biden, and while the White House allegedly was withholding an Oval Office visit from Zelenskyy in exchange for an investigation. These actions are what fueled the impeachment effort against Trump, in which he was ultimately acquitted. Mark Paoletta, former OMB general counsel during the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital in a statement this week that the clause in the bill text is an ""effort to inappropriately tie Trump’s hands in his next term by locking in Ukraine funding for multiple years.""

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/special-counsel-jack-smith-asks-scotus-reject-trump-request-delay-2020-election-case,"Alina Habba blasts Jack Smith for moving Trump from campaign trail into courtroom: 'Obvious and pathetic' Trump attorney Alina Habba joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the former president's push for Special Counsel Jack Smith to be held in contempt and other legal troubles. Special counsel Jack Smith has requested that the U.S. SupremeCourt reject former Trump's bid to delay his 2020 election interference from going to trial. Trump legal team requested the delay be extended earlier this week as the court considers whether to take up the question whether the former president is immune from prosecution for official acts in the White House . Two lower courts have overwhelmingly rejected that argument, prompting Trump to ask the high court to intervene. Prosecutors responded to Trump's appeal within two days even though the court had given them until next Tuesday. Trump and Jack Smith Though their filing does not explicitly mention the upcoming November election or Trump's status as the Republican primary front-runner , prosecutors described the case as having ""unique national importance"" and said that ""delay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a speedy and fair verdict."" Smith's team charged Trump in August with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Trump DEMANDS DOJ ‘IMMEDIATELY’ DROP CHARGES AGAINST HIM IN CLASSIFIED DOCS CASE AFTER Biden DECISION Trump's lawyers, meanwhile, have argued that he is shielded from prosecution for acts that fell within his official duties as president — a legally untested argument since no other former president has been indicted. The trial judge and then a federal appeals court rejected those arguments, with a three-judge appeals panel last week saying, ""We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter."" The Trump campaign said NBC News reporter Vaughn Hillyard was not banned or barred based on his reporting. The proceedings have been effectively frozen by Trump's immunity appeal, with U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan canceling a March 4 trial date while the appeals court considered the matter.

A recent column from NewYork Times columnist Frank Bruni claimed that the media and Biden allies ignoring the HunterBiden scandal and other Biden administration corruption are being ""dishonest"" and ""dangerous."" The president's son pleaded not guilty to federal gun charges in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in October, which accused him of lying about using drugs in October 2018 on a gun purchase form. He previously acknowledged that he struggled with a crack cocaine addiction during a period in 2018, but his attorneys said he did not break the law. HUNTER Biden'S GUN POUCH HAD COCAINE RESIDUE ON IT, PROSECUTORS SAY HunterBiden has since said he has stopped using drugs and is working to turn his life around. HunterBiden was charged with making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm; making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a federal firearms licensed dealer; and one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-menendez-court-docs-150000-diamond-ring-bribe-007-cell-phone-covid-19-lab,"Menendez pleading not guilty to charges FOX News’ Bryan Llenas reports on New Jersey Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez’s charges of acting as a foreign agent to Egypt. Prosecutors unveiled additional details regarding the elaborate bribery scheme involving Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey in a court filing on Monday. Allegations include a $150,000 bribe, which allegedly featured a diamond engagement ring for his wife, Nadine Menendez, a COVID-19 lab in New Jersey, and a ""007"" cellphone linked to Nadine. According to prosecutors, Nadine's engagement ring was part of a $150,000 bribe from a New Jersey man who asked Menendez to get him off the hook for criminal charges after he was charged with insurance fraud in the state. Part of that chunk of cash was also used to purchase a Mercedes-Benz convertible for Nadine to replace her vehicle around the same time police records show she struck and killed a pedestrian in December 2018. SEN MENENDEZ RESPONDS TO LATEST SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT ON CORRUPTION CHARGES: 'SENSATIONALIZED ALLEGATIONS' Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife, Nadine, leave a Manhattan court after they were arraigned on federal bribery charges on Sept. 27, 2023. The filing also alleges that in 2020 and 2021, Menendez solicited New Jersey mayors to authorize the use of a specific COVID-19 testing laboratory that at the time was paying Nadine. Prosecutors argued the additional evidence show ""substantial evidence that Menendez did in fact know about the corrupt quid pro quo."" Menendez also allegedly regularly made calls to Nadine's ""007"" phone, ""an apparent reference to the fictional character James Bond,"" prosecutors wrote. Menendez, along with Nadine and three other New Jersey businessmen — Wael Hana, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes — were first charged in the federal bribery scheme on Sept. 23. All have pleaded not guilty. DEMOCRAT SEN MENENDEZ'S WIFE HIT, KILLED PEDESTRIAN WHILE DRIVING IN 2018: REPORTS Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and his wife, Nadine, arrive at the federal courthouse in NewYork on Sept. 27, 2023. According to the latest superseding indictment unsealed last month, Menendez is accused of accepting bribes and gifts in exchange for helping to benefit Qatar as part of a corruption scheme from 2021 through 2023, one year longer than originally thought, the Justice Department said. Menendez is already facing federal charges for allegedly acting as a foreign agent and accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes to benefit the Egyptian government through his power and influence as a senator. The Democrat senator allegedly made several public statements supporting the Qatari government and then provided them to Daibes so that he could share them with the Qatari investor and a Qatari government official. The investor negotiated a million-dollar investment real estate project with Daibes. Among the allegations is that Menendez and his wife enriched themselves with cash, gold bars and other luxury items. The couple received the gifts in exchange for Menendez using his influence to induce the Qatari Investment Co. to invest with Daibes, prosecutors say. DEMOCRAT SEN BOB MENENDEZ FACING INDICTMENT ON BRIBERY CHARGES Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and his wife, Nadine, arrive at the federal courthouse in NewYork on Sept. 27, 2023.

The House on Wednesday passed a bipartisan resolution condemning Hamas terrorists’ use of rape and sexual violence as weapons of war during — and since — the attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. The resolution, introduced by Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla., and endorsed by 200 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle, passed in a vote of 418 to 0. Democrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib , D-Mich., voted ""present.""

REPUBLICANS PUSH TO RESUSCITATE UKRAINE AND BORDER TALKS AS DEMS URGE GOP TO SIDESTEP JOHNSON Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla. The resolution ""condemns all rape and forms of sexual violence as weapons of war, including those acts committed by Hamas terrorists"" and calls on ""all nations to criminalize rape and sexual assault, and hold accountable all perpetrators of sexual violence, including state and non-state armed groups."" ""There are some subjects that are so difficult to talk about, but it is our responsibility to do so,"" Rep. Frankel said from the House floor Wednesday. ""Hamas’ actions on Oct. 7 and continuing is almost too difficult to speak about, raping, mutilating and burning to inflict psychological pain and unleashing trauma that continues to plague a grieving Israel,"" she said. ""Shockingly and alarmingly, Hamas’ violence has been met with a shrug from many corners in the world, and many deny it. Such weapons have been used throughout history and around the world to terrorize and traumatize victims, but that doesn't make it OK. It must never be normalized. Our resolution makes it clear sexual violence is a crime against humanity,"" Frankel said. HAMAS HAD COMMAND TUNNEL UNDERNEATH UNRWA’S HEADQUARTERS IN GAZA, ISRAEL SAYS Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., voted ""present"" on a resolution to condemn Hamas' use of rape and sexual vioence as weapons of war. Rep. Tlaib said she was ""disturbed"" that the resolution ""completely ignores and erases any sexual violence committed"" allegedly committed by IDF forces. Those claims are unsubstantiated.

Some Senate Republican want the upper chamber to reconvene ""immediately"" to proceed with an impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the ongoing migrant crisis at the southern border. The House voted to impeach Mayorkas Tuesday night in a tight 214-213 vote. Mayorkas is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached by the U.S. Congress since 1876. ""Schumer should reconvene the Senate immediately and proceed to trial,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wrote in a post on X Tuesday night. Fox News Digital reached out to Schumer's office for comment and did not hear back by time of publication. But in a statement Tuesday night after the vote, Schumer said the impeachment trial will begin later this month. The Senate is scheduled to return from recess on Feb. 26. ""The House impeachment managers will present the articles of impeachment to the Senate following the state work period,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""Senators will be sworn in as jurors in the trial the next day."" HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS Sen. Josh Hawley sounds off on Secretary Mayorkas after Tuesday's House vote. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said in a post that the Senate ""cannot fail"" to ""uphold"" its constitutional duty and ""conduct an impeachment trial for Secretary Mayorkas, who has ignored his duty to protect our country."" ""Chuck Schumer is trying to sweep this travesty under the rug by violating the constitution and foregoing a trial. Republican leadership cannot stand idly by and let him,"" he wrote. Echoing the urgency, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. urged the upper chamber to take quick action: ""The Senate must take this up immediately."" ""While some in the Senate sided with securing Ukraine's border before our own, I'm glad to see House Republican do the right thing and hold this lawless administration accountable,"" he wrote Tuesday night. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., compared how Democrat treated Trump's impeachment trials versus ""the cabinet member responsible for 9 million illegal migrant entries on the southern border."" ""They show zero interest in demanding real accountability,"" Schmitt said. ""This impeachment coming to the Senate will undoubtedly show how unserious Democrat have become when it comes to responsibly leading the country and protecting Americans. Mayorkas’ impeachment proceedings should be brought to the Senate floor ASAP, but don’t hold your breath for any meaningful change at the border while Democrat are in charge."" Schmitt's sentiments are shared by several Senate Republican who opposed the failed border bill that was in the national security supplemental package, citing concerns about increased power for Biden and Mayorkas. They argued that shifting asylum claim responsibilities to the secretary of Homeland Security undermines immigration court processes. HERE ARE THE 3 HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO TORPEDOED MAYORKAS’ IMPEACHMENT VOTE Asylum seekers line up in front of the historic Roosevelt Hotel, which was converted into a city-run shelter for newly arrived migrant families in NewYork City, on Sept. 27, 2023. The Senate ultimately voted to remove the border bill text and passed a standalone $95 billion foreign aid bill. ""I don't think it ever made sense to many Americans that we're negotiating a border deal with the person we're trying to impeach,"" Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., told Fox News Digital in an interview ahead of the vote on Tuesday. ""I welcome the impeachment,"" Marshall said. ""He didn't enforce the law of the land, he broke his oath to Americans as well. So I think, for all those reasons, he should be impeached."" Tuesday evening’s vote marked House Republican’ second attempt at impeaching Mayorkas. GOP lawmakers targeted the Biden official over the ongoing migrant crisis at the U.S. southern border , accusing him of deliberately flaunting existing immigration law and worsening the situation. OVER 40 LAWMAKERS SIGN BRIEF TO SUPPORT TEXAS IN IMMIGRATION FIGHT WITH Biden ADMINISTRATION Sen. Roger Marshall said of Secretary Mayorkas, seen here with Biden, ""He didn't enforce the law of the land, he broke his oath to Americans as well. So I think, for all those reasons, he should be impeached."" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital has reached out to DHS for comment. In a statement following the House's vote, DHS spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said: ""House Republican will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution for political gain rather than working to solve the serious challenges at our border. While Secretary Mayorkas was helping a group of Republican and Democrat Senators develop bipartisan solutions to strengthen border security and get needed resources for enforcement, House Republican have wasted months with this baseless, unconstitutional impeachment. ""Without a shred of evidence or legitimate Constitutional grounds, and despite bipartisan opposition, House Republican have falsely smeared a dedicated public servant who has spent more than 20 years enforcing our laws and serving our country.

House Republican defense hawks are pushing for a way to get foreign aid passed through Congress after Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., made clear he would not entertain the Senate’s attempts at doing so. While House GOP leaders have been critical of the Senate passing a multibillion-dollar foreign aid package, there is a large contingent of both Republican and Democrat who are hoping to see some form of aid for U.S. allies overseas – so much so that top House Democrat are publicly pressuring them to join a bid to end-run Johnson and bring the Senate package to the floor anyway. Nearly all the House Republican who Fox News Digital heard from said they have not been contacted by the other side but are interested in seeing the aid pass, while others are working on a new plan altogether. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, told reporters on Wednesday that a small group of GOP lawmakers was working on a plan that involved aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific as well as elements of border security. US NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER: SEE WHAT AMERICAN TAXPAYERS OWE IN REAL TIME House GOP defense hawks Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Jen Kiggans and Don Bacon are all expressing concerns about the future of foreign aid in the House. ""It’s not bipartisan yet. We’re working on it,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""I care about Ukraine. I used to live there. It was my last assignment as an FBI agent, and we’re not going to let them be abandoned."" Fitzpatrick said that plan would be ""very similar but separate"" to the Senate’s and said legislative text could be available ""within a few days."" The Senate passed a $95 billion foreign aid package aimed at Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and Gaza early on Tuesday morning after a marathon all-night session in which conservatives, mainly opposed to sending aid to Ukraine, tried to slow it down. SENATE PASSES CONTROVERSIAL FOREIGN AID BILL SENDING BILLIONS TO UKRAINE, ISRAEL, AND TAIWAN It came together quickly after an earlier version, a $118 billion aid package that also included border and immigration reforms, fell apart despite months of sensitive bipartisan negotiations. In both cases, Johnson rejected the bills and said he would not hold a vote on them in their current form. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has dismissed both of the Senate's efforts at passing foreign aid. The House Democrat minority, meanwhile, is publicly threatening to go around Johnson’s back with a discharge petition – a move that would allow them to force a vote on the Senate’s aid package if a majority of the House signed off. But even moderate House Republican poured cold water on the idea. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said ""one or two"" Democrat approached him about signing a discharge petition but that he was not interested at the moment. Other defense-minded Republican said they hadn’t heard from Democrat at all. PENTAGON FINALLY RUNS OUT OF MONEY FOR UKRAINE, URGES 50 ALLIES TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING KYIV Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., said he was ""not going to go against leadership like that"" but called for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan aid to be passed as separate bills. Navy veteran Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., would not tell Fox News Digital if she’d sign a discharge petition or if one was offered, but she also suggested she’s had few answers from her own leadership on a foreign aid plan. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ushered a $95 billion aid bill through his chamber early on Tuesday morning. ""I read and see whatever I'm going to make a judgment call on, but no one has talked to me,"" Kiggans said. ""I've asked actually a couple times, when are we voting on a foreign aid package? Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., said it was ""premature"" to discuss a discharge petition but similarly conceded that action needed to be taken. ""I think we need to step up and help our allies around the world, and we should be able to come up with a way to do that without resorting to a discharge petition,"" he told Fox News Digital.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russian-nuclear-capabilities-space-could-threaten-international-satellites-us-military-comms-sources,"House Intel Chair warns the nation of a 'serious national security threat' Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on Rep. Mike Turner's 'cryptic' announcement on 'America Reports.' The U.S. has intelligence of a national and international security threat related to Russian nuclear capabilities in space which could threaten satellites, including potentially knocking out U.S. military communications and reconnaissance, Fox News has learned. Sources tell Fox News that the Russian capability has not yet deployed. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner on Wednesday morning first warned of a ""serious national security threat,"" and called on Biden to declassify it. HOUSE INTEL CHAIR TURNER WARNS OF 'SERIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT,' URGES Biden TO DECLASSIFY ""The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has made available to all Members of Congress information concerning a serious national security threat,"" Turner said. ""I am requesting that Biden declassify all information relating to this threat so that Congress, the Administration, and our allies can openly discuss the actions necessary to respond to this threat."" Fox News Digital obtained the notice sent to congressional members Wednesday, which pointed to ""an urgent matter with regard to a destabilizing foreign military capability that should be known by all Congressional Policy Makers."" Sources told Fox News that the deliberations about declassifying the intelligence relate to interests in protecting intelligence sources and methods. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, speaks during the House GOP news conference on FY23 government funding on Dec. 14, 2022. A separate source told Fox News that the threat is ""concerning Russian capability,"" noting that the ""potential seriousness of the threat is grave,"" but ""the threat is not immediate in nature."" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., later attempted to quell any panic caused by Turner's statement by explaining that last month, he sent a letter to the White House ""requesting a meeting with the president to discuss a serious national security issue that is classified."" ""In response to that letter, a meeting is now scheduled tomorrow on this matter here at the Capitol with the Gang of Four and with the president's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan,"" Johnson said. ""I will press the administration to take appropriate action, and everybody can be comforted by that."" Johnson said he ""saw Chairman Turner's statement on the issue, and I want to assure the American people there's no need for public alarm."" ""We are going to work together to address this matter as we do all sensitive matters that are classified,"" Johnson said. ""And beyond that, I'm not at liberty to disclose classified information and really can't say much of that, but we just want to assure everyone, steady hands are at the wheel, we're working on it. There's no need for alarm."" Biden'S MEMORY STRUGGLES COULD IMPERIL NATIONAL SECURITY, DEFENSE EXPERTS WARN: 'NOT ONLY WEAK BUT CONFUSED' Meanwhile, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., and Vice Chairman Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said their committee ""has the intelligence in question, and has been rigorously tracking this issue from the start."" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 13, 2023. ""We continue to take this matter seriously and are discussing an appropriate response with the administration,"" Warner and Rubio said. ""In the meantime, we must be cautious about potentially disclosing sources and methods that may be key to preserving a range of options for U.S. action."" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday at the White House press briefing said that he was surprised by Turner's statement, given that earlier in the week he reached out to members of Congress to offer himself to come to Capitol Hill to give a personal briefing on the matter. That briefing will take place on Thursday. ""I am a bit surprised that Congressman Turner came out publicly today in advance of a meeting on the books for me to go sit with him alongside our intelligence and defense professionals tomorrow. That’s his choice to do that,"" Sullivan said. ""All I can tell you is that I’m focused on going to see him, sit with him, as well as the other House members of the Gang of Eight tomorrow, and I’m not in a position to say anything further from this podium at this time, other than to make the broad point that this administration has gone further, and in more creative, more strategic ways, dealt with the declassification of intelligence in the national interest of the United States than any administration in history,"" he continued. Sullivan added: ""You definitely are not going to find an unwillingness to do that when it’s in our national security interest to do so."" He said, however, that the administration has prioritized ""the issue of sources and methods."" ""Ultimately, these are decisions for the president to make, but in the meantime, the most important thing is we have the opportunity to sit in a classified setting and have the kind of conversation with the House Intelligence leadership that I, in fact, had scheduled before Congressman Turner went out today,"" Sullivan said. ""It is highly unusual, in fact, for the national security adviser to do that,"" he said","['house', 'intel', 'chair', 'warns', 'nation', 'serious', 'national', 'security', 'threat', 'senior',

Biden attacked Special Counsel Robert Hur for bringing up his son's death, but it was allegedly Biden who first brought up the death of Beau in an interview. According to NBC , citing multiple sources, Hur never asked the president about his recollection of his son's death in 2015 to brain cancer during two days of interviews last October. The sources said that Biden brought up Beau's death, not Hur nor his team. Biden first brought up his son's death after being asked about his workflow while he and a ghostwriter were writing a memoir at a Virginia rental home from 2016 to 2018, the sources said. NEW POLL REVEALS THE TOP 2 ISSUES AFFECTING VOTER CONFIDENCE IN Biden Special Counsel Robert Hur's report on his probe into Biden's handling of classified documents noted that the president has ""poor memory."" The sources said that during the interview Biden began trying to recall what was happening in his life at the time and he ""appeared confused"" about when Beau had died. The 81-year-old president allegedly got the date of his son's death correct-- May 30, but not the year. This image from Special Council Robert Hur’s investigation released by the Department of Justice on Thursday, February 8, 2024 shows Biden inside his Virginia home office in October 2017. The reported revelations came after Biden lashed out last Thursday at Special Counsel Robert Hur who investigated his handling of classified documents after the prosecutor in his final report noted that the president struggled to remember details such as when his son died. WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN COMPLAINS ABOUT MEDIA COVERAGE OF Biden'S COGNITIVE ABILITY: ‘STRIKING INACCURACIES’ ""How in the h--- dare he raise that,"" Biden said in a press conference on Thursday. ""Frankly, when I was asked the question I thought to myself it wasn’t any of their d--- business."" Biden held a press conference on Thursday in response to Special Counsel Robert Hur's description of his age and memory. While Hur's report absolved Biden of criminal wrongdoing relating to his handling of classified documents , it characterized the president as an ""elderly man with a poor memory."" The report, released last Thursday, described the president’s memory as ""hazy,"" ""fuzzy,"" ""faulty,"" ""poor,"" and suggested Biden did not remember when his son Beau Biden died. ""We conclude that no criminal charges are warranted in this matter,"" the report, released Thursday, states. ""We would reach the same conclusion even if the Department of Justice policy did not foreclose criminal charges against a sitting president.""

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-director-wray-makes-surprise-israel-stop-elevated-threat-picture,"FBI Director Wray speaks about surprise Israel visit FBI Director Christopher Wray made an unannounced visit to Israel for meetings on terror threats in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. Wray spoke by phone Wednesday with Fox News' David Spunt. FBI Director Christopher Wray made an unannounced trip to Israel, where he sat in on intelligence meetings before speaking to Fox News. Wray's visit was his first time on the ground in Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. The FBI director met with his counterparts in Israel's Shin Bet and others. He spoke to Fox News before boarding a plane to leave the country for Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where he’ll speak Thursday. ""We’ve seen a rogues' gallery of foreign terrorist organizations both express support and praise for the Hamas attacks and threaten to attack U.S. interests at home and abroad,"" Wray said. ""We're working with all our partners to confront the elevated threat picture, which includes, I should add, the threats posed by Iran and Hezbollah, both in terms of the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, and more broadly."" ISRAEL CONDUCTS AIRSTRIKES IN LEBANON AFTER DEADLY HEZBOLLAH ATTACK FBI Director Christopher Wray makes a surprise stop in Israel on Wednesday, meeting with Israeli national police. ""We have learned a lot,"" Wray added of the information gathered by the FBI in the wake of Oct. 7. ""The information exchange between our two countries has been terrific as well. As with a number of our other close allies who are all collaborating out of a shared commitment to combat the scourge of terrorism."" Wray also spoke about the FBI's role in protecting Americans in Israel and Gaza. ""The FBI has been working side by side, really around the clock, to aid in investigative and recovery efforts to provide support and services to U.S. victims of the attack and their families, and to identify and disrupt additional threats that we're seeing emanating from the conflict,"" he said. Video Wray said he felt it was important to travel to meet with Israeli law enforcement and intelligence partners on Israeli soil ""to show our unwavering support and commitment to these partners in the wake of the horrific terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas against innocent civilians on Oct. 7, and second, because we are closely working — again, I cannot overstate this — closely working with our partners in Israel and others around the world to investigate these attacks."" ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTRY CALLS FOR UNRWA COMMISSIONER TO RESIGN AMID ALLEGATIONS ITS WORKERS ASSISTED HAMAS ""Some of our FBI folks here in Israel have literally not taken a day off since Oct. 7 , and I'm proud of the incredible support the team has provided to our partners during this dark time. The FBI’s partnership with our Israeli counterparts is long-standing, close and robust,"" he said.

Jackson told reporters on Wednesday that he’s making his fifth attempt at pressuring Biden to prove his mental fitness for office. Asked about Jackson’s comments by Fox News Digital, White House spokesman Andrew Bates replied: ""Hi, Dr. Nick!"" Attached was a photo of a character from ""The Simpsons"" named Dr. Nick Riviera, a physician whose running gag in the cartoon is about his questionable medical practices and maiming of patients. Biden BLISTERED BY MAINSTREAM MEDIA AFTER ‘DISASTER’ PRESS CONFERENCE Texas GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician, is again re-upping his request for Biden to take a cognitive test. Jackson, a medical doctor who formerly served as the White House physician, slammed the White House for making light of the situation. ""Even Dr. Nick knows something is wrong with Biden,"" Jackson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""The American people are legitimately concerned and the clowns in the Biden administration think this is a joke. This is not a joke."" ""Rather than administer a cognitive test or coming up with legitimate answers to Biden apparent cognitive decline, the clowns inside the White House are sending cartoon memes to address a concern they know is real,"" he said. ""Nearly 80 percent of Americans are concerned about Biden physical and mental health, and 73 percent of Democrat feel he is too old or unfit for another term."" Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, speaks during a panel discussion at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 28, 2021. Jackson said earlier during a Wednesday press conference that he was sending a letter directly to the president as well as every member of his Cabinet. ""We are going to continue to make this an issue. I will be introducing another letter today. This will be the fifth letter that I’ve introduced that I’ve sent to the president,"" he said. Biden LASHES OUT AT REPORTERS ASKING ABOUT AGE CONCERNS AFTER SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT Jackson pointed out that former Trump took a cognitive exam when he was in the White House after mounting questions about his mental state in the media. ""I would like to see that same type of enthusiasm and insistence from the press right now, that Biden submit to a cognitive exam as part of his physical exam,"" Jackson said. ""And if he thinks he’s fit to lead this country, prove it to us with some objective data that says so."" SPECIAL COUNSEL CALLS Biden 'SYMPATHETIC, WELL-MEANING, ELDERLY MAN WITH A POOR MEMORY,' BRINGS NO CHARGES Special Counsel Robert Hur cast doubt on Biden's memory in his 388-page report on the president's handling of classified documents. It comes as Biden critics continue to seize on a recent report by Special Counsel Robert Hur regarding the president’s handling of classified documents before he took office.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-borderline-impeachment,"Welcome to Fox News’ Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail. What's Happening? - House Republican warns of serious national security threat related to space - Mayorkas becomes first cabinet secretary to be impeached since the 19th century - Democrat Tom Suozzi triumphs in special election to replace Santos Mayorkas impeachment succeeds by one vote U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas speaks to the media about an overview of public safety plans for Super Bowl week at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center on February 07, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. On the eve of Valentine's Day and Ash Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was impeached in a historic vote over his mishandling of the illegal immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. T hree Republican lawmakers, Reps. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., Ken Buck, R-Colo., and Tom McClintock, R-Calif., jumped the aisle to vote against the impeachment. The 214-213 vote came after the first impeachment failed earlier this month. Every House Democrat showed up to protect the cabinet secretary, including Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who temporarily left the hospital where he was recovering from surgery to cast his vote. Once Rep. Steve Scalise returned to D.C. from a cancer treatment, the GOP had the numbers to advance the articles of impeachment. House Republican have accused Mayorkas of violating his oath to defend the U.S. by failing to secure the border and ""refusing"" to enforce immigration laws. The three Republican who voted against impeachment on Tuesday have criticized Mayorkas' handling of the border but expressed reservations over whether it rose to the level of impeachment. McClintock warned it could set a precedent for political impeachments that could harm Republican officials in the future. This is the first time a Cabinet secretary has been impeached by the U.S. Congress since 1876. It's now up to the Senate — where Democrat run the show — to hold an impeachment trial. Reps. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., Ken Buck, R-Colo., and Tom McClintock, R-Calif.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nato-comments-trigger-fierce-media-european-opposition-how-serious-he,"The media doesn’t allow the public to hear what Trump has to say: Robby Soave Reason senior editor Robby Soave and Democrat strategist Ameshia Cross join ‘MediaBuzz’ to discuss the SupremeCourt appearing to tilt towards Trump in the Colorado ballot case. Trump has made some news that is reverberating around the world. It wasn’t him saying – after that incredible Super Bowl comeback by Kansas City – that he signed a law boosting earnings for musicians so Taylor Swift shouldn’t endorse Biden. It wasn’t ""we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country, we will rout the Fake News Media, we will Drain the Swamp."" It’s not that he told a SouthCarolina rally that "" Biden's thugs are still trying to put me in jail on fake charges for crimes that they openly admit that Crooked Joe did. He actually did these crimes"" – while adding ""I’m not looking for anything to happen to this guy."" WHY Biden’S ANGER AND DEFENSIVENESS INFLAMED ANXIETY ABOUT HIS MEMORY ISSUES No, it’s about NATO. Trump recalled a conversation with the president ""of a big country,"" who he says asked him if they didn’t increase their defense contribution to the North Atlantic alliance ""and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?"" Sharing his response at the rally, Trump claims he said: ""You didn’t pay. You’re delinquent… No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want."" The idea that Vladimir Putin could do ""whatever the hell they want"" set off alarm bells, not only among foreign policy officials in Europe but in much of the mainstream media here at home. One potential impact would be on Ukraine, with Trump having declined to endorse more military aid to that weakened country, which would allow Russia’s unprovoked invasion to succeed in either keeping its territorial gains along the eastern border or capturing the entire sovereign nation. And yet there is further evidence, as if any were needed, that the GOP is now Trump party. Some of the biggest Republican hawks, who staunchly supported NATO in the past, say they have no problem with the former president’s remarks. Republican presidential candidate and former Trump during a Get Out The Vote rally at Coastal Carolina University on Feb. 10 in Conway, SouthCarolina. As the Washington Post points out, Lindsey Graham said when he ran for president in 2016 that Trump comments had made Putin a ""very happy man."" On Sunday, the senator said he was ""not worried"" about Trump latest remarks ""at all."" Tom Cotton, another leading hawk, said in 2016 that America must ""make sure that we stand by NATO and we stand for countries like Ukraine and Georgia"" who face ""Russian aggression, and recognize Vladimir Putin as the adversary he is."" On Sunday, the senator said NATO countries not paying their full share are ""already encouraging Russian aggression, and Trump is simply ringing the warning bell."" UKRAINE AID PACKAGE WOULD BE USED TO IMPEACH Trump, SEN VANCE WARNS Marco Rubio said in 2018 that Trump went too far by ""questioning the value of the alliance,"" tweeting: ""The end of #NATO would be a dream come true for #Putin."" On Sunday, the senator said he had ""zero"" concerns about Trump latest comments and suggested he didn’t mean them: ""We’ve already been through this. ""You would think people would’ve figured it out by now."" And here’s the kicker: Rubio and Graham pushed through a bill barring any president from withdrawing from NATO. I wonder who they might have had in mind? Republican presidential candidate and former Trump walks out to speak at a Get Out The Vote campaign rally held at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, SouthCarolina, on Feb 10. Look, I get it. This is how Trump negotiates. During his first term he regularly questioned the value of the NATO alliance as a way of getting some country to keep their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, with some success. It’s an approach he honed as a businessman when he would threaten to walk away from a deal unless certain conditions were met. But when Trump took office with little experience in foreign policy, he was talked out of any withdrawal by such retired generals as Jim Mattis and John Kelly. The NewYork Times reports this anecdote: ""Soon after former President Donald J. Trump took office, his staff explained how NATO’s mutual defense obligations worked. ""‘You mean, if Russia attacked Lithuania, we would go to war with Russia?’ he responded. ‘That’s crazy.’ Mr. Trump has never believed in the fundamental one-for-all-and-all-for-one concept of the Atlantic alliance."" But Trump has made clear that in a second term he would surround himself with loyalists who would not attempt to stop such decisions. Senior adviser Jason Miller says Biden has reversed Trump approach to NATO: ""Democrat and media pearl-clutchers seem to have forgotten that we had four years of peace and prosperity under Trump, but Europe saw death and destruction under Obama-Biden and now more death and destruction under Biden."" FINLAND CENTER-RIGHT CANDIDATE ALEXANDER STUBB DECLARES PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY WITH NEARLY 52% OF VOTE Much of the media are leading the charge on NATO. CNN’s Christiane Amanpour called Trump latest comments ""insane."" It’s also true that top European officials are being quoted on the record as criticizing Trump language. They would be irresponsible if they didn’t start plotting a Plan B. European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 28, 2022. The crux of the argument is that the alliance created in the wake of World War II has worked well in deterring war and doesn’t need to be fixed. I happen to be in that camp – and the only time the mutual defense pact has been invoked was when our allies aided us after the Sept. 11 attacks. Footnote: Trump now says on Truth Social that ""NO MONEY IN THE FORM OF FOREIGN AID SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ANY COUNTRY UNLESS IT IS DONE AS A LOAN, NOT JUST A GIVEAWAY.""

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/ukraine-aid-oversight-watchdog/index.html,"More than 400 personnel take part in the oversight of Ukraine aid, according to a new report from a US government watchdog, underscoring the massive effort to manage billions of dollars in US assistance. Congress has appropriated $113.4 billion in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , which has provided security, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other countries affected by the war. The money also supports an enlarged US military presence in Europe and the training of the Ukrainian military. To oversee the interagency effort, the inspectors general from the Defense Department, State Department, and United States Agency for International Development work with 20 other federal agencies and the Ukrainian government. In total, the report said there are more than 400 personnel working across the US, Germany, Ukraine and Europe to audit and evaluate US assistance to Ukraine. The report comes as some Republican, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have demanded more oversight over Ukraine aid before they agree to any additional funding. Earlier this week, the Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid package that includes assistance to Ukraine, but the bill faces an uncertain future in the US House of Representatives, where Johnson has signaled he will not bring it for a vote. Johnson met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in December, saying afterwards that the Biden administration wanted “billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight.” The lengths to which the US has gone to provide that oversight is detailed in the first quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve, the name for the mission to bolster NATO and support Ukraine. The mission was first launched in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea, but it grew significantly following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Defense Department Office of the Inspector General alone has more than 200 staff members working on Ukraine oversight. Of those, 28 are in Europe, including two in Kyiv, with plans for more, the report said. The State Department watchdog has more than 100 staff members working on Ukraine oversight, three of whom are in Kyiv. The USAID watchdog has another 80 personnel working on Ukraine. In addition, law enforcement personnel from the different agencies work with Ukrainian authorities to investigate misconduct that could threaten US aid to Ukraine. The watchdogs have also set up the Ukraine Fraud and Corruption Investigative Working Group to root out and prevent corrupt dealings of US aid to Ukraine. Since the beginning of the war, these agencies have opened 57 investigations and closed 14 of them, resulting in two convictions, according to the report. In one case, investigators found that since November 2021 – three months before Russia invaded Ukraine – seven US soldiers and civilian contractors stole seven tons of fuel worth $2 million from a base in Romania used to assist Ukraine. As the war nears the two year mark, the report also details Russia’s growing reliance on foreign aid to fuel its war effort. Since the US warned a deal was possible last summer, North Korea has likely provided Russia with “millions of artillery rounds and other weapons” and may be preparing to provide other weapons as well. Iran has provided more than 1,000 one-way attack drones and multi-use drones to Russia, as well as other military equipment to use against Ukraine. Iran has also likely considered providing Russia with ballistic missiles, which CNN reported last month was a possibility.","['400', 'personnel', 'take', 'part', 'oversight', 'ukraine', 'aid', 'according', 'new', 'report', 'us', 'government', 'watchdog', 'underscoring', 'massive', 'effort', 'manage', 'billions', 'dollars', 'us', 'assistance', 'congress', 'appropriated', '1134', 'billion', 'response', 'russia’s', 'invasion', 'ukraine', 'provided', 'security', 'economic', 'humanitarian', 'assistance', 'ukraine', 'countries', 'affected', 'war', 'money', 'supports', 'enlarged', 'us', 'military', 'presence', 'europe', 'training', 'ukrainian', 'military', 'oversee', 'interagency', 'effort', 'inspectors', 'general', 'defense', 'department', 'state', 'department', 'united', 'states', 'agency', 'international', 'development', 'work', '20', 'federal', 'agencies', 'ukrainian', 'government', 'total', 'report', '400', 'personnel', 'working', 'across', 'us', 'germany', 'ukraine', 'europe', 'audit', 'evaluate', 'us', 'assistance', 'ukraine', 'report', 'comes', 'republican', 'including', 'house', 'speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'demanded', 'oversight', 'ukraine', 'aid', 'agree', 'additional', 'funding', 'earlier', 'week', 'senate', 'passed', '953', 'billion', 'foreign', 'aid', 'package', 'includes', 'assistance', 'ukraine', 'bill', 'faces', 'uncertain', 'future', 'us', 'house', 'representatives', 'johnson', 'signaled', 'bring', 'vote', 'johnson', 'met', 'ukrainian', 'president', 'volodymyr', 'zelensky', 'december', 'saying', 'afterwards', 'biden', 'administration', 'wanted', '“billions', 'additional', 'dollars', 'appropriate', 'oversight”', 'lengths', 'us', 'gone', 'provide', 'oversight', 'detailed', 'first', 'quarterly', 'report', 'special', 'inspector', 'general', 'operation', 'atlantic', 'resolve', 'name', 'mission', 'bolster', 'nato', 'support', 'ukraine', 'mission', 'first', 'launched', '2014', 'russia', 'invaded', 'crimea', 'grew', 'significantly', 'following', 'russia’s', 'fullscale', 'invasion', 'ukraine', 'february', '2022', 'defense', 'department', 'office', 'inspector', 'general', 'alone', '200', 'staff', 'members', 'working', 'ukraine', 'oversight', '28', 'europe', 'including', 'two', 'kyiv', 'plans', 'report', 'state', 'department', 'watchdog', '100', 'staff', 'members', 'working', 'ukraine', 'oversight', 'three', 'kyiv', 'usaid', 'watchdog', 'another', '80', 'personnel', 'working', 'ukraine', 'addition', 'law', 'enforcement', 'personnel', 'different', 'agencies', 'work', 'ukrainian', 'authorities', 'investigate', 'misconduct', 'threaten', 'us', 'aid', 'ukraine', 'watchdogs', 'set', 'ukraine', 'fraud', 'corruption', 'investigative', 'working', 'group', 'root', 'prevent', 'corrupt', 'dealings', 'us', 'aid', 'ukraine', 'since', 'beginning', 'war', 'agencies', 'opened', '57', 'investigations', 'closed', '14', 'resulting', 'two', 'convictions', 'according', 'report', 'one', 'case', 'investigators', 'found', 'since', 'november', '2021', 'three', 'months', 'russia', 'invaded', 'ukraine', 'seven', 'us', 'soldiers', 'civilian', 'contractors', 'stole', 'seven', 'tons', 'fuel', 'worth', '2', 'million', 'base', 'romania', 'used', 'assist', 'ukraine', 'war', 'nears', 'two', 'year', 'mark', 'report', 'details', 'russia’s', 'growing', 'reliance', 'foreign', 'aid', 'fuel', 'war', 'effort', 'since', 'us', 'warned', 'deal', 'possible', 'last', 'summer', 'north', 'korea', 'likely', 'provided', 'russia', '“millions', 'artillery', 'rounds', 'weapons”', 'may', 'preparing', 'provide', 'weapons', 'well', 'iran', 'provided', '1000', 'oneway', 'attack', 'drones', 'multiuse', 'drones', 'russia', 'well', 'military', 'equipment', 'use', 'ukraine', 'iran', 'likely', 'considered', 'providing', 'russia', 'ballistic', 'missiles', 'reported', 'last', 'month', 'possibility']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/former-fbi-informant-charged-biden-burisma/index.html,"Special counsel David Weiss charged a former FBI informant with lying about Biden and his son HunterBiden’s involvement in business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, undercutting a major aspect of Republican’ impeachment inquiry into the president. Alexander Smirnov, 43, is facing charges in connection with lying to the FBI and creating false records. He was arrested Thursday at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, after his arrival in the US from overseas, and will make his initial appearance in federal court Thursday afternoon. CNN is working to determine whether Smirnov has an attorney. The indictment alleges that Smirnov’s story to the FBI “was a fabrication, an amalgam of otherwise unremarkable business meetings and contacts that had actually occurred but at a later date than he claimed and for the purpose of pitching Burisma on the Defendant’s services and products, not for discussing bribes to [Biden] when he was in office.” Congressional Republican have championed Smirnov’s now-discredited allegations for roughly a year, though not by name. They fought with the FBI to obtain memos about what Smirnov told investigators and publicly released the materials over the FBI’s objections. The congressional Republican repeatedly praised Smirnov as “credible” and put his uncorroborated claims front-and-center in their impeachment inquiry into the president. While announcing the impeachment inquiry, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said “a trusted FBI informant has alleged a bribe to the Biden family.” The FBI is now using some of the same memos that congressional Republican released as part of their indictment against Smirnov. “For months we have warned that Republican have built their conspiracies about Hunter and his family on lies told by people with political agendas, not facts,” said Abbe Lowell, HunterBiden’s lawyer, in a statement to CNN. “We were right and the air is out of their balloon. This is just another instance of Chairmen Comer and Jordan peddling falsehoods based on dishonest, uncredible allegations and witnesses,” he added. House Oversight Chair James Comer said in a Thursday statement to CNN that his investigation into the president does not revolve around Smirnov or his claims made in the FD-1023 – a form the FBI uses to memorialize information gathered from confidential sources – that Republican legislators have cited. “To be clear, the impeachment inquiry is not reliant on the FBI’s FD-1023. It is based on a large record of evidence, including bank records and witness testimony, revealing that Biden knew of and participated in his family’s business dealings,” the Kentucky Republican said. He said the FBI had previously defended Smirnov’s credibility. “When asked by the committee about their confidence in the confidential human source, the FBI told the committee the confidential human source was credible and trusted, had worked with the FBI for over a decade, and had been paid six figures,” Comer added. According to court records, Smirnov told an FBI agent that he had spoken with the owner of Burisma about the company’s efforts to buy a company in the United States. As part of his report to the FBI, the indictment alleges, Smirnov also noted that someone referred to as “Businessperson 1” was on the board of Burisma and was also the son of an individual referred to as “Public Official 1.” Though the indictment does not identify these individuals, sources identified “Public Official 1” as Biden and “Businessperson 1” as HunterBiden. During Biden campaign for presidency, Smirnov allegedly submitted reports to the FBI about two meetings with Burisma executives from 2015 and 2016, during which the executives admitted that they hired HunterBiden to “protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems.” Smirnov also allegedly reported that executives paid $5 million each to Joe and HunterBiden while Biden was vice president so that Hunter would “take care of all those issues through his dad,” referring to a criminal investigation being conducted by the then-Ukrainian prosecutor general into Burisma. “In truth and fact, the Defendant had contact with executives from Burisma in 2017, after the end of the Obama-Biden Administration and after the then Ukrainian Prosecutor General had been fired in February 2016, in other words, when [Biden] had no ability to influence U.S. policy and when the Prosecutor General was no longer in office,” the indictment states. It continues, “In short, the Defendant transformed his routine and unextraordinary business contacts with Burisma in 2017 and later into bribery allegations against [Biden], the presumptive nominee of one of the two major political parties for President, after expressing bias against [Biden] and his candidacy.” This story has been updated with additional details","['special', 'counsel', 'david', 'weiss', 'charged', 'fbi', 'informant', 'lying', 'biden', 'son', 'hunterbiden’s', 'involvement', 'business', 'dealings', 'ukrainian', 'energy', 'company', 'burisma', 'holdings', 'undercutting', 'major', 'aspect', 'republican’', 'impeachment', 'inquiry', 'president', 'alexander', 'smirnov', '43', 'facing', 'charges', 'connection', 'lying', 'fbi', 'creating', 'false', 'records', 'arrested', 'thursday', 'harry', 'reid', 'international', 'airport', 'las', 'vegas', 'arrival', 'us', 'overseas', 'make', 'initial', 'appearance', 'federal', 'court', 'thursday', 'afternoon', 'working', 'determine', 'whether', 'smirnov', 'attorney', 'indictment', 'alleges', 'smirnov’s', 'fbi', '“was', 'fabrication', 'amalgam', 'otherwise', 'unremarkable', 'business', 'meetings', 'contacts', 'actually', 'occurred', 'later', 'date', 'claimed', 'purpose', 'pitching', 'burisma', 'defendant’s', 'services', 'products', 'discussing', 'bribes', 'biden', 'office”', 'congressional', 'republican', 'championed', 'smirnov’s', 'nowdiscredited', 'allegations', 'roughly', 'year', 'though', 'name', 'fought', 'fbi', 'obtain', 'memos', 'smirnov', 'investigators', 'publicly', 'released', 'materials', 'fbi’s', 'objections', 'congressional', 'republican', 'repeatedly', 'praised', 'smirnov', '“credible”', 'put', 'uncorroborated', 'claims', 'frontandcenter', 'impeachment', 'inquiry', 'president', 'announcing', 'impeachment', 'inquiry', 'thenhouse', 'speaker', 'kevin', 'mccarthy', '“a', 'trusted', 'fbi', 'informant', 'alleged', 'bribe', 'biden', 'family”', 'fbi', 'using', 'memos', 'congressional', 'republican', 'released', 'part', 'indictment', 'smirnov', '“for', 'months', 'warned', 'republican', 'built', 'conspiracies', 'hunter', 'family', 'lies', 'people', 'political', 'agendas', 'facts”', 'abbe', 'lowell', 'hunterbiden’s', 'lawyer', 'statement', '“we', 'right', 'air', 'balloon', 'another', 'instance', 'chairmen', 'comer', 'jordan', 'peddling', 'falsehoods', 'based', 'dishonest', 'uncredible', 'allegations', 'witnesses”', 'added', 'house', 'oversight', 'chair', 'james', 'comer', 'thursday', 'statement', 'investigation', 'president', 'revolve', 'around', 'smirnov', 'claims', 'made', 'fd1023', 'form', 'fbi', 'uses', 'memorialize', 'information', 'gathered', 'confidential', 'sources', 'republican', 'legislators', 'cited', '“to', 'clear', 'impeachment', 'inquiry', 'reliant', 'fbi’s', 'fd1023', 'based', 'large', 'record', 'evidence', 'including', 'bank', 'records', 'witness', 'testimony', 'revealing', 'biden', 'knew', 'participated', 'family’s', 'business', 'dealings”', 'kentucky', 'republican', 'fbi', 'previously', 'defended', 'smirnov’s', 'credibility', '“when', 'asked', 'committee', 'confidence', 'confidential', 'human', 'source', 'fbi', 'committee', 'confidential', 'human', 'source', 'credible', 'trusted', 'worked', 'fbi', 'decade', 'paid', 'six', 'figures”', 'comer', 'added', 'according', 'court', 'records', 'smirnov', 'fbi', 'agent', 'spoken', 'owner', 'burisma', 'company’s', 'efforts', 'buy', 'company', 'united', 'states', 'part', 'report', 'fbi', 'indictment', 'alleges', 'smirnov', 'noted', 'someone', 'referred', '“businessperson', '1”', 'board', 'burisma', 'son', 'individual', 'referred', '“public', 'official', '1”', 'though', 'indictment', 'identify', 'individuals', 'sources', 'identified', '“public', 'official', '1”', 'biden', '“businessperson', '1”', 'hunterbiden', 'biden', 'campaign', 'presidency', 'smirnov', 'allegedly', 'submitted', 'reports', 'fbi', 'two', 'meetings', 'burisma', 'executives', '2015', '2016', 'executives', 'admitted', 'hired', 'hunterbiden', '“protect', 'us', 'dad', 'kinds', 'problems”', 'smirnov', 'allegedly', 'reported', 'executives', 'paid', '5', 'million', 'joe', 'hunterbiden', 'biden', 'vice', 'president', 'hunter', '“take', 'care', 'issues', 'dad”', 'referring', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'conducted', 'thenukrainian', 'prosecutor', 'general', 'burisma', '“in', 'truth', 'fact', 'defendant', 'contact', 'executives', 'burisma', '2017', 'end', 'obamabiden', 'administration', 'ukrainian', 'prosecutor', 'general', 'fired', 'february', '2016', 'words', 'biden', 'ability', 'influence', 'us', 'policy', 'prosecutor', 'general', 'longer', 'office”', 'indictment', 'states', 'continues', '“in', 'short', 'defendant', 'transformed', 'routine', 'unextraordinary', 'business', 'contacts', 'burisma', '2017', 'later', 'bribery', 'allegations', 'biden', 'presumptive', 'nominee', 'one', 'two', 'major', 'political', 'parties', 'president', 'expressing', 'bias', 'biden', 'candidacy”', 'updated', 'additional', 'details']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/new-york-trump-hearing/index.html,"A date for Trump first criminal trial has been set in the former president’s NewYork criminal hush money case . With Trump in attendance at the hearing in downtown Manhattan, NewYork state Judge Juan Merchan confirmed that the former president’s trial will begin on March 25, as originally scheduled, on charges that Trump falsified business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign. The decision helps solidify the former president’s legal calendar that is filling up at the same time that his 2024 campaign is closing in on the Republican nomination for president. The date of the NewYork trial had been in limbo in part because Trump federal trial in Washington, DC, on election subversion charges had initially been scheduled for March, too, but that is now on hold while Trump is attempting have the charges dismissed on claims of presidential immunity. He has asked the SupremeCourt to step in, which could further delay the federal trial. That would likely make the NewYork hush money case the first of Trump election-year trials. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was the first to charge Trump last year, accusing him in a 34-count indictment of falsifying business records as part of a cover up to conceal hush money payments before the 2016 election to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had an affair with Trump. Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty. Here’s what to know heading into Thursday’s hearing: Trump sought to dismiss the case or various charges Merchan on Thursday rejected Trump long-shot motion to dismiss the entire case. Arguments that will likely be at the crux of the former president’s trial defense may also be ruled on. Trump and his lawyers have accused Bragg of resurrecting a “zombie” case six years too late to serve a political agenda to interfere with Trump 2024 presidential bid. Bragg has also endured negative speculation from critics who argue the case is thin and question whether it passes legal muster. Prosecutors allege Trump conspired with his former personal attorney Michael Cohen in a scheme to buy Daniels’ silence ahead of the 2016 election and falsified business records to hide reimbursements checks to Cohen who facilitated the $130,00 payment to Daniels. They allege Trump was aware of falsified invoices, reimbursement checks to Cohen and how those reimbursements were recorded in an attempt to commit or conceal several crimes, including election law, tax laws and the falsification of other business records. Trump lawyers have said he paid Cohen through his personal accounts — not involving business records. If he doesn’t toss the entire case, Trump lawyers have said Merchan should at least dismiss charges they argue are multiplicitous, because he currently faces more than one count for each of the 11 reimbursement payments to Cohen. The parties may also argue Thursday over who Trump can call in his defense case at trial, including campaign finance experts. Trump attorneys have also asked Merchan to consider holding a hearing over alleged grand jury leaks — the typically secretive judicial process was widely reported in national news ahead of the indictment. They also want the judge to compel more specific information from prosecutors about their evidence relating to Trump alleged intent to defraud. Trump lawyers have said the grand jury didn’t hear evidence that the former president knew about the scheme or intended to defraud anyone. Prosecutors told the judge the six-year delay was “justified” since there was an ongoing related federal investigation and Trump fought a subpoena for his records, which landed the case before the US SupremeCourt. How we got here: The years-long investigation into Trump The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office officially launched its investigation into the alleged hush-money schemes under the previous DA, Cy Vance, in August 2018, the same day Cohen pleaded guilty to charges related to the Daniels payments across the street in a Manhattan federal courtroom. Under Vance, prosecutors shifted their investigation to focus on the Trump Organization’s finances and away from the repayment scheme. Bragg, who took office in January 2022, has accused Trump of leaning on his political power to avoid criminal responsibility for years and campaigned on a promise to prosecute the former president.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images Trump boards his airplane before flying to Iowa to campaign on March 13. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images In pictures: Trump in court for hush money case Prev Next A grand jury was eventually green-lit to hear the hush money case in December 2022, days before a jury in another state criminal trial convicted the Trump Organization on 17 counts related to tax fraud that slapped Trump company with $1.6 million in fines. The grand jury empaneled on January 23, 2023, ultimately returned the 34-count indictment in this case on March 30. If convicted on the 34 identical counts of falsifying business records, which are a class E felony, Trump could face up to 4 years in prison. But as a first-time offender, he would unlikely be sentenced to prison time. It would make him a convicted felon regardless of his sentence. As the conviction would be on state charges, Trump would not be able to pardon himself if reelected president. Trump first trial will begin next month as the primaries continue Merchan set the initial March 25 trial date last year, but he said they could “make any necessary” changes if there are any “actual conflicts” – a nod to the federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith. Indeed, district Judge Tanya Chutkan initially set a March 4 trial date for Trump federal election subversion trial in Washington, DC, which would have likely pushed back the NewYork trial. Now that trial is on hold while Trump immunity claims play out. Complicating the schedule further is the uncertainty of time for Trump appeal: The SupremeCourt could decline to hear the case, putting the trial back in Chutkan’s hands to begin relatively quickly. But if the high court does take up Trump appeal, that trial is likely on hold for weeks, if not months, while the presidential immunity issue is decided. The NewYork case in many ways fell into the background last year following Trump arraignment last spring. Smith brought charges against Trump for his alleged mishandling of classified documents last June and again for alleged election subversion in August, and then Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis charged Trump later that month in a sprawling racketeering case involving Trump and 18 co-defendants. But now the NewYork trial is primed to be the first where a jury will decide Trump guilt or innocence. Now that the March 25 date remains in effect, it will take place as Trump is collecting delegates in presidential primaries for the Republican nomination and preparing for a potential general election rematch against Biden. It’s not clear yet whether Trump would be required to attend every day of the trial or if he can ask not to appear. His attendance for Thursday’s hearing was waived but he chose to attend, rather than going to Georgia to watch a hearing seeking to disqualify Willis from his Georgia case. Trump is only an observer at this hearing Trump on Thursday is sitting in his fourth different courtroom this year, including three for separate cases in NewYork. He attended closing arguments last month in his NewYork civil fraud trial before Judge Arthur Engoron – in which the judge is expected to rule on Friday – as well as testified and attended multiple days at the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, where a jury found Trump liable for $83.3 million in damages. Trump also sat in for oral arguments at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on his immunity claims in January, though he did not speak or have a role in that hearing. In both prior NewYork cases, Trump found ways to make his presence felt in the courtroom, both on the witness stand and from the defendant’s table. In the defamation case, district Judge Lewis Kaplan restricted what Trump could testify to before the jury, and at one point he warned Trump that he could be removed from the courtroom if he kept up his audible commentary during Carroll’s testimony. And in the NewYork civil trial, Trump time on the witness stand in November was a spectacle, where the former president used the opportunity to bash the trial and the charges brought by the NewYork attorney general. During closing arguments last month, Engoron told Trump lawyer he could not speak as part of the defense case – but Trump found a way to deliver a five-minute monologue, anyway. Speaking to reporters ahead of his appearance, Trump — who has similarly used other court proceedings to generate publicity for his campaign — said the case against him is politically motivated and amounts to “election interference.” “This is just a way of hurting me in the election because I’m leading by a lot,” Trump said.","['date', 'trump', 'first', 'criminal', 'trial', 'set', 'president’s',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/new-york-redistricting-house-map/index.html,"A bipartisan redistricting commission in NewYork approved a new congressional map Thursday that could help Empire State Democrat make slight gains in this year’s US House elections but falls well short of an electoral windfall for the party. NewYork is expected to be an epicenter in the battle for the House this fall, with Republican’ narrow majority on the line. The GOP flipped four seats in the state in the 2022 midterms, gains that helped the party win control of the chamber. The new map, approved 9-1 by the NewYork State Independent Redistricting Commission, now moves for final action to the Democrat-controlled state legislature, where its fate is unclear. Several Democrat on Thursday said they were still examining the commission’s work product and remained noncommittal. “The Senate Majority is eager to review the proposed map,” Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the top Democrat in the state Senate, said in a statement. “We plan to discuss and decide our subsequent actions soon.” Freshman Republican Brandon Williams – who represents parts of central NewYork – would see the biggest change to his district under the map approved Thursday. His new seat would include more territory favorable to Democrat – likely resulting in a Democrat pickup. But, under the compromise crafted by the commission, two Hudson Valley seats – held by Republican Marc Molinaro and Democrat Pat Ryan – each appear to have grown safer for the incumbents. And, notably, the commission’s map leaves largely undisturbed other House districts in the NewYork City suburbs, which have been viewed as potential battlegrounds in November. The US Capitol is seen at sunrise in Washington, DC, on October 18, 2023. Jose Luis Magana/AP Related article Redistricting fights in these states could determine which party controls the US House Ken Jenkins, the commission’s chairman and a Democrat, described Thursday’s vote as “ultimately a victory for the commission process and for small-d Democrat participation in the state of NewYork.” The disputes over NewYork’s congressional districts have been closely followed in Washington, where the outcome of redistricting fights across the country could shape which party controls the House after November’s elections. The GOP’s majority in the chamber narrowed further this week when Democrat Tom Suozzi won a special election to succeed expelled former Republican Rep. George Santos in NewYork’s 3rd Congressional District on Long Island. The new map eased GOP fears that it could have been a major boon for Democrat, and a top NewYork Republican called on state lawmakers to accept the commission’s approach. “The State Legislature should adopt these district lines without change,” state GOP chairman Ed Cox said in a statement. “The voting public deserves to have continuity in district boundaries and to avoid chaos.” But Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the state Democrat Party, urged caution, saying the map would require “a thorough examination” by the legislature. If approved by the legislature, the NewYork map would represent a far more modest outcome than what occurred last fall in North Carolina – where the GOP-controlled legislature passed a heavily gerrymandered map that is poised to ensure Republican dominance in the state’s 14-member congressional delegation. The NewYork commission’s action on Thursday came after the state’s highest court tasked the panel with drawing a new map – following a protracted legal battle. A state court judge had overseen the process of drawing the map used in the 2022 elections after the redistricting commission had failed to agree on new lines after the 2020 census. Democrat in the state legislature have final say over the map, holding the power to reject the commission’s plan and take over the line-drawing themselves. But that risks triggering another round of legal fights, with Republican likely to challenge any map they view as an overly aggressive gerrymander. In a statement, Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which supports the GOP’s redistricting efforts, said the commission’s redistricting process “should have never been reopened” and called the panel’s map “a step back.” As part of the compromise approved Thursday, the 16th Congressional District, which includes a slice of NewYork City and parts of Westchester County, remained virtually unchanged. Two-term Democrat Rep. Jamaal Bowman is facing a primary challenge from George Latimer, the Westchester County executive who previously served in the NewYork State Assembly. Edna Courville, here posing for a portrait in Texas City, Texas, on September 23, 2023, is a plaintiff in an ongoing redistricting case in Galveston County. Michael Starghill Jr. Related article Redistricting fights across South put future of Voting Rights Act in the spotlight again Latimer said Thursday he was moving forward with his bid and is confident that the state legislature would complete the process of approving the map. “Regardless of the timing or the ultimate disposition of the lines, we look forward to continuing to bring our message of progressive results that benefit the people of our area, in whatever neighborhood they live and whatever jurisdictions are ultimately assigned to CD-16,” Latimer said in a statement. NewYork faces a court-ordered deadline of February 28 to complete its redistricting process, but it was unclear Thursday when the state legislature would next meet to consider the map. Time is running short. State lawmakers in NewYork are scheduled to be on recess next week, and House candidates are slated to begin collecting signatures for petitions to run for office on February 27. That leaves little time for lawmakers to approve – and for Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul to sign into law – new district lines. Approving the map would require the support of a two-thirds majority in each chamber, noted Jeffrey Wice, an expert on redistricting and an adjunct professor at NewYork Law School. And some legislators “don’t know what to make” of the map at the moment. “It’s still not over yet,” Wice said","['bipartisan', 'redistricting', 'commission', 'newyork', 'approved', 'new',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/takeaways-fani-willis-testimony-georgia/index.html,"The Georgia election subversion case against Trump and 14 of his allies took a stunning turn Thursday when two top prosecutors testified under oath about their romantic relationship at a hearing triggered by allegations of self-dealing that have the potential to derail the entire effort. The all-day hearing escalated steadily throughout the day, culminating with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis taking the witness stand for a combative brawl with defense attorneys that drew several rebukes from the judge. Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. Trump arrives on stage for a Get Out The Vote rally at the North Charleston Convention Center on February 14, 2024 in North Charleston, SouthCarolina. Win McNamee/Getty Images Related article Trump team facing a new conundrum: How to stay on the trail during a weekslong criminal trial Judge Scott McAfee convened the hearing after some of Trump co-defendants surfaced allegations of a relationship between Willis and Nathan Wade, whom she hired in 2021 to join the prosecution team. Trump and his co-defendants want the judge to disqualify Willis’ team from the case – or throw out the charges – because of a possible conflict-of-interest. There was talk of cash exchanging hands from Willis to Wade, where they store their money at home, CashApp usage, and their spending habits – all to get to the question of whether Willis benefitted financially from putting him on her staff. The hearing will continue Friday with Willis still on the stand. The judge said he does not plan to issue a ruling on Friday. Here are takeaways from the hearing that was at times jaw-dropping, awkward and strikingly personal. Willis’ defiant afternoon on the stand What unfolded on Thursday is extremely rare in American courtrooms. The district attorney who has charged Trump with racketeering went under oath to defend her ethics and answer personal questions about her relationship with Wade. The risks could not be greater, and Willis’ credibility is on the line. Things quickly went off the rails. Willis didn’t act much like a traditional witness and was more like a prosecutor, arguing with the defense attorneys, raising objections, making legal arguments and even having exchanges with the judge. She even raised her voice at one point. This led to a few rebukes from McAfee, who urged her and other attorneys in the courtroom to maintain “professionalism” and to not “talk over each other.” Willis repeatedly accused some of the defense attorneys of peddling lies – before and after the judge’s admonishment. “You’ve lied in this. … I think you lied right here,” Willis said to attorney Ashleigh Merchant, pointing to copies of filings that raised accusations of self-dealing and nepotism. ‘I’m not on trial,’ Willis says Willis seized several opportunities to defend herself. The district attorney had fought efforts to make her appear, both in Wade’s ongoing divorce proceedings and in the hearing on Thursday, up until the moment she came into the room to take the stand. She said at the beginning of her testimony that she was “very anxious” to defend herself, “so I ran to the courtroom.” “You think I’m on trial,” Willis said, in her sharpest pushback of the day. “These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020,” she added, pointing toward the table of attorneys representing defendants in the criminal case. “I’m not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.” She later slammed the defense attorneys, calling them “confused” and “intrusive.” “Ms. Merchant’s interests are contrary to democracy, not to mine,” Willis said, attacking the attorney for Trump campaign attorney Michael Roman, who is accused of playing a leading role in the multi-state “fake electors” plot to subvert the Electoral College. Video Ad Feedback Hear what legal expert thinks about Fani Willis' testimony 03:39 - Source: CNN When did the relationship start? On the stand, Wade stuck to his earlier claim – in a sworn affidavit submitted to the court – that his romantic relationship with Willis began in early 2022 and that they split travel and vacation expenses. But Robin Bryant-Yeartie, a former friend of Willis and Fulton County employee, contradicted that claim, testifying that she had “no doubt” that the Willis-Wade affair began in late 2019. Notably, that would be before Willis hired Wade to lead the Trump probe in late 2021. Bryant-Yeartie said she observed “hugging, kissing, close affection” between Willis and Wade prior to 2022, when they claimed their romantic relationship began. She also testified that Willis had told her in 2020 and 2021 that she was dating Wade. There was some Clinton-esque parsing of words on whether Wade cheated on his ex-wife by being with Willis. Past filings from Roman’s team salaciously noted that she had been dating “a married man.” Wade testified that his previous marriage was broken since 2015, long before his relationship with Willis began, saying, “My marriage was irretrievably broken” in 2015, and “I was free to have a relationship.” Wade and Willis describe using cash for reimbursements Wade and Willis have offered a simple explanation for why there’s essentially no paper trail to back up his claims they split expenses: Willis used cash. Credit card statements submitted in Wade’s divorce proceedings show he paid for two flights for them in recent years, to San Francisco and Miami. They also took lavish trips to Belize, the Bahamas and some Caribbean cruises. When pressed on whether he paid for Willis’ travel when they vacationed together, Wade said that Willis reimbursed him for a flight “in cash.” Wade said he did not have receipts for all of the times Willis reimbursed him for trips – pushing back against the allegations from the defense side that Willis was essentially getting kickbacks from him in the form of vacations. “I did not deposit the cash in my account,” Wade replied, smirking at times. Defense attorney Craig Gillen, who represents one of the fake electors, grilled Wade on what he would do with the cash reimbursements – in at least one case, thousands of dollars. “You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash?” Gillen shot back, raising his voice slightly. “No sir,” Wade said, to which Gillen replied: “Not a single solitary one?” “Not a one,” Wade responded. Willis: ‘I don’t need anybody to foot my bills’ There was also a dispute over when the relationship ended, and whether it had any impact on the decision to seek the massive RICO indictment against Trump and others in last August. Both said the relationship ended in summer 2023. Willis implied that the physical component ended earlier in the summer, but that the two had a “tough conversation” that fully ended things afterward. Trump lawyer Steven Sadow asked Willis about the breakup, eliciting an answer that revealed sexist remarks that Wade allegedly made to Willis in the past. She said, he “is used to women that, as he told me one time, ‘the only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich.’” She explained that this was a part of their breakup – but it also was a defense to the self-dealing claims against her. “We would have brutal arguments about the fact that ‘I am your equal,’” Willis said. “I don’t need anything from a man – a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back.” Willis added, “I don’t need anybody to foot my bills.” Earlier, Sadow asked Wade during his own testimony whether the two had any “personal relationship at all” since their relationship ended, saying “and you know what I mean by that.” Wade shot back, asking if Sadow meant “if I had intercourse with the district attorney.” “We’re very good friends, probably closer than ever because of these attacks,” Wade said. “But if you’re asking me about specific intercourse, the answer is no.” Huge distraction from the charges against Trump – for now Nothing that happened Thursday undercut the factual allegations against Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, or the other GOP allies who are accused of trying to overturn the 2020 election. But the hearing shifted the conversation away from those allegation and away from Trump legal woes for now. Earlier in the day, a NewYork judge set the trial date for Trump historic first trial, in the hush-money criminal case, for March 25. But by the afternoon, that news was nearly washed away by the jaw-dropping testimony taking place in Atlanta and being beamed across the country on national television. While Willis will return to the stand for cross-examination on Friday, any benefit Trump receives may be short lived. Friday, a separate NewYork judge is expected to issue his decision in the Trump civil fraud case that’s an existential threat to his business. State prosecutors want that judge to issue a $370 million fine against Trump, after finding that Trump and his company committed significant fraud against banks and insurers by lying about his net worth and assets. They also want Trump barred from doing business in NewYork","['georgia', 'election', 'subversion', 'case', 'trump', '14', 'allies', 'took', 'stunning', 'turn', 'thursday', 'two', 'top', 'prosecutors',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/navy-federal-congressional-black-caucus/index.html,"Members of Congress pressed the CEO of the nation’s largest credit union for answers about racial disparities in its mortgage lending during a Capitol Hill meeting Thursday but said they left unsatisfied with her responses. Mary McDuffie, the CEO of Navy Federal Credit Union, met with three members of the Congressional Black Caucus who have demanded answers in the wake of CNN’s reporting on racial disparities in the lender’s mortgage approvals. It’s the latest example of congressional scrutiny for Navy Federal, which has more than 13 million members and lends to military servicemembers, defense personnel, veterans and their families. “We’re trying to achieve the goal of closing the racial wealth gap in America,” said Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, after meeting with McDuffie. “You cannot do that with practices like this that deny equal opportunity to homeownership.” A CNN investigation published in December found that Navy Federal approved more than 75% of the White borrowers who applied for a new conventional home purchase mortgage in 2022 while approving less than 50% of Black borrowers who applied for the same type of loan, according to the most recent federal data available. Photo illustration. Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/Shutterstock Related article The nation’s largest credit union rejected more than half its Black conventional mortgage applicants The nearly 29-percentage-point gap in Navy Federal’s approval rates was the widest of any of the 50 lenders that originated the most mortgage loans in 2022. The disparity remained even after accounting for variables such as applicants’ income, debt-to-income ratio and property value, CNN’s review found. McDuffie met for about an hour Thursday with Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus; Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance; and Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California. McDuffie declined to answer CNN’s questions as she entered and exited the closed-door meeting. Cleaver told CNN after the meeting that McDuffie and other Navy Federal representatives “could not provide an answer” explaining the racial disparities in mortgage approvals, and that he hoped to hear more from them in the future. “We’re expecting to have another meeting with them, we’re expecting to get facts this time,” he said. A Navy Federal spokesperson said in a statement that the credit union is “committed to engaging with policymakers on this important issue” and “we work daily to help expand economic opportunity and access to credit for our diverse community of members.” Reps. Steven Horsford and Emanuel Cleaver speak to reporters after meeting with Navy Federal Credit Union CEO Mary McDuffie on Capitol Hill. CNN In December, days after CNN’s story was published, Navy Federal hired a civil rights lawyer to review its mortgage practices and “make recommendations to drive further access to home ownership.” Horsford said that the members “asked very specific questions about the timeline of that review,” and found the responses from Navy Federal “inadequate.” “Time is of the essence, because every single day that they don’t change or update their protocols is a servicemember, and particularly a Black or Latino servicemember, who is facing denials,” he said. Navy Federal has previously argued that CNN’s analysis is incomplete because it did not include applicants’ credit scores or information about their available cash deposits or relationship history with the lender – none of which is publicly available in the federal data. The credit union declined to provide CNN any additional data that would make it possible to analyze those factors. Navy Federal has also noted that a higher percentage of its mortgage loans go to Black borrowers than most other large lenders. But Horsford said Thursday that that excuse didn’t address “the issue of denials.” “More than 40% of our servicemembers, active duty, are people of color,” he said. “So yeah, they are one of the leading lenders and mortgage lenders for Black home loans – because they have a higher percentage of servicemembers who are their membership. It should be higher.” Several Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, including Cleaver and ranking member Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, wrote a letter last week asking the committee’s Republican chair to hold a hearing on the racial disparities in Navy Federal’s mortgage lending. And ten Democrat senators have separately asked federal regulators to examine Navy Federal’s mortgage practices, citing both CNN and a separate analysis of public mortgage data by Senate banking committee staff that also found racial disparities in its lending. Navy Federal is also facing a federal class-action lawsuit from mortgage applicants who cite CNN’s reporting and allege that the credit union discriminated against them. A judge approved a motion to consolidate three separate lawsuits against the credit union into a single case last month.","['members', 'congress', 'pressed', 'ceo', 'nation’s', 'largest', 'credit',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/matt-rosendale-montana-senate/index.html,"Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale has ended his bid for Senate less than a week after launching his campaign, citing former Trump ’s endorsement of his Republican primary opponent. “I have long been a supporter of the President, and remain so. But I have been forced to calculate what my chances of success would be with Trump supporting my opponent,” Rosendale said in a statement Thursday. He added that with a lack of resources and the former president’s endorsement “the hill was just too steep.” Just hours after Rosendale announced his run Friday, Trump endorsed retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who has the backing of several high-profile Republican, in the race to take on vulnerable Democrat Sen. Jon Tester. However, Trump added that he would back Rosendale should he run for reelection to his House seat in Montana’s 2nd Congressional District. The congressman did not say Thursday whether he plans to do so, and a number of prominent Montana Republican have already filed for his deep-red seat. Politico was first to report that Rosendale was ending his Senate bid. With Rosendale’s exit, Republican will avoid what was expected to be a contentious primary. Several Republican — including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Montana Sen. Steve Daines, who leads the Senate GOP campaign arm — have backed Sheehy as the party looks to flip the chamber in November. Montana, along with West Virginia and Ohio, is one of three Senate seats Democrat are defending in states twice won by Trump. Rosendale’s candidacy sparked concern among Republican that if he — a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus who lost an earlier Senate bid to Tester in 2018 — emerged as the primary winner, they would be far less likely to win the seat in November. First elected to the House in 2020, Rosendale previously served in the Montana Legislature and as state auditor. He moved to Montana in 2002, and the former land developer’s Maryland roots were a frequent target of Democrat attacks in his 2018 race against Tester, which the incumbent won by less than 4 points","['montana', 'rep', 'matt', 'rosendale', 'ended', 'bid', 'senate', 'less', 'week', 'launching', 'campaign', 'citing', 'trump', '’s', 'endorsement', 'republican', 'primary', 'opponent', 'long', 'supporter', 'president', 'remain', 'forced', 'calculate', 'chances', 'success', 'trump', 'supporting', 'opponent”', 'rosendale', 'statement', 'thursday', 'added', 'lack', 'resources', 'president’s', 'endorsement', '“the', 'hill', 'steep”', 'hours', 'rosendale', 'announced', 'run', 'friday', 'trump', 'endorsed', 'retired', 'navy', 'seal', 'tim', 'sheehy', 'backing', 'several', 'highprofile', 'republican', 'race', 'take', 'vulnerable', 'democrat', 'sen', 'jon', 'tester', 'however', 'trump', 'added', 'back', 'rosendale', 'run', 'reelection', 'house', 'seat', 'montana’s', '2nd', 'congressional', 'district', 'congressman', 'say', 'thursday', 'whether', 'plans', 'number', 'prominent', 'montana', 'republican', 'already', 'filed', 'deepred', 'seat', 'politico', 'first', 'report', 'rosendale', 'ending', 'senate', 'bid', 'rosendale’s', 'exit', 'republican', 'avoid', 'expected', 'contentious', 'primary', 'several', 'republican', 'including', 'senate', 'minority', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'montana', 'sen', 'steve', 'daines', 'leads', 'senate', 'gop', 'campaign', 'arm', 'backed', 'sheehy', 'looks', 'flip', 'chamber', 'november', 'montana', 'along', 'west', 'virginia', 'ohio', 'one', 'three', 'senate', 'seats', 'democrat', 'defending', 'states', 'twice', 'trump', 'rosendale’s', 'candidacy', 'sparked', 'concern', 'among', 'republican', 'member', 'hardline', 'house', 'freedom', 'caucus', 'lost', 'earlier', 'senate', 'bid', 'tester', '2018', 'emerged', 'primary', 'winner', 'far', 'less', 'likely', 'win', 'seat', 'november', 'first', 'elected', 'house', '2020', 'rosendale', 'previously', 'served', 'montana', 'legislature', 'state', 'auditor', 'moved', 'montana', '2002', 'land', 'developer’s', 'maryland', 'roots', 'frequent', 'target', 'democrat', 'attacks', '2018', 'race', 'tester', 'incumbent', 'less', '4', 'points']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/trump-state-prosecutions-new-york-georgia/index.html,"Two cases that could defy Trump capacity to thwart prosecutions and even to overturn eventual convictions against him if he returns to the White House reach critical tests on Thursday with major implications for the 2024 election. In the latest remarkable twist of his multiple legal sagas, Trump is in court in NewYork for a procedural hearing ahead of his trial over a hush money payment to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Over Trump objection, a judge confirmed that his trial will start on March 25 , when jury selection begins. It will mark the first time the fate of an ex-president and potential presidential nominee has been put to a jury in a criminal case. While Trump is in court in NewYork , he also is at the center of another drama in Georgia where a judge is holding an evidentiary hearing into an attempt to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and to throw out a vast racketeering case against Trump and associates over his attempt to subvert Biden ’s 2020 election win in the swing state. Judge Scott McAfee has already said that Willis could be disqualified if she benefited financially from a romantic relationship with a colleague she appointed to be a prosecutor in the case. Most of Trump legal filings in various cases have one thing in common: an attempt to prevent them from moving to trial and to delay accountability — at least until the next election. Trump has a particular interest in stopping the NewYork hush money and Georgia election interference cases because even as president with a sympathetic attorney general, he would find it difficult to interfere in ongoing prosecutions, to overturn convictions or even to pardon himself since this executive power does not cover state crimes. The high-stakes hearings nearly 900 miles apart speak to the extraordinary entanglement of the 2024 election and Trump legal quagmire that now spans multiple presidential elections. Thursday will not even be the first time this week that the ex-president’s legal plight is playing out in two separate cities. On Monday for instance, Trump was in court in Fort Pierce, Florida, for a hearing over his indictment related to retaining classified documents on a day when his lawyers sent a filing to the US SupremeCourt in Washington based on his expansive demands for absolute presidential immunity to shield him from his actions after the 2020 election. Emphasizing his constant double duty in the courtroom and the campaign trial, the former president gave a fiery speech in SouthCarolina Wednesday night ahead of the state’s primary later this month – before heading to NewYork. “They’re weaponizing law enforcement for high level election interference — that’s what they’ve done,” he said. “I am being indicted for you, never forget,” Trump told his crowd. “I am delighted to be doing it.” Just before Trump spoke, special counsel Jack Smith sent his reply to Trump immunity claims to the SupremeCourt, arguing that there was a vital public interest in seeing him tried — though amid the accused’s claims of political persecution, Smith didn’t specifically reference the narrowing calendar before November’s election. In yet another case, another judge in NewYork is expected to rule on Friday whether Trump will have to pay hundreds of millions in dollars over ill-gotten gains exposed in a civil fraud trial that targeted the ex-president, his adult sons and the Trump Organization. The ruling could remove Trump capacity to do business in NewYork — the city where he made his name. The legal and political collision that seems to become more intense with every passing week makes it all but certain the current election will sow divisive, long-term aftereffects however Trump legal perils end that will deepen the country’s political estrangement and further damage trust in electoral and judicial institutions. Trump is back in the city where he made his name The former president is making a habit of showing up in court and staging histrionics to express his contempt for the legal system and to frame the prosecutions he’s facing as political persecution — the dominant theme of his 2024 election campaign. Outside court in NewYork on Thursday, Trump offered a preview of his tactics ahead of the coming trial, accusing Biden’s White House of running “election interference.” There is, however, no basis for Trump claims that the White House has any role in directing the district attorney’s case. Trump presence has the potential to turn any sober legal hearing into a circus, and several judges have become infuriated as they struggle to keep him under control. In the NewYork case, Trump is facing 34 charges of falsifying business records. He allegedly did so to cover up payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public over an alleged past affair in a way that could influence voter. The ex-president, who denies the affair, has pleaded not guilty in this case, as he has to all four of his criminal indictments. Some legal experts see the NewYork case as the least serious of the four criminal threats facing the former president, and even if he is convicted, he is not expected to face a jail term. Others, however, see the 2016 case as the first stirrings of Trump attempts to mislead voter and to interfere in the conduct of US elections. As the expected first criminal trial, the NewYork case could still have important political implications. So far, polling evidence and the results of early Republican primary races suggest that Trump indictments have served to unite the party’s grass roots voter behind his campaign. But the impact of Trump legal problems on a wider electorate is still to be tested. Several recent polls have suggested that some voter could have second thoughts about him if he is a convicted felon by Election Day. A vital sideshow to Trump racketeering trial will take place in Georgia In Georgia, McAfee is holding an evidentiary hearing into allegations that Willis benefited financially from a romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade after she hired him. “The issues at point here are whether a relationship existed, whether that relationship was romantic or non-romantic in nature, when it formed and whether it continues,” McAfee said Monday. “And that’s only relevant because it’s in combination with the question of the existence and extent of any benefit conveyed as a result of their relationship.” One of Trump co-defendants, Michael Roman, is alleging that Willis and Wade benefited significantly from the case at the expense of taxpayers and that there is a significant conflict of interest. He is citing financial statements from Wade’s divorce proceedings to argue that he took Willis on lavish vacations after she hired him. Roman is calling both for the dismissal of Willis and for the shelving of the entire case, arguing that it has raised questions about fairness in the legal system and that the entire prosecution has been tainted by the drama. But a lawyer for the district attorney is accusing Roman of trying to divert attention from the underlying case. “The defense is not bringing you facts, the defense is not bringing you law, the defense is bringing you gossip,” attorney Anna Cross said. “The court should not condone that practice.” In an amicus brief filed with the court, a group of legal experts, former prosecutors and law professors argued that even if all the allegations against Willis are true, “they do not mandate disqualification here. Indeed they do not come close.” Willis has suggested that the allegations are motivated by race. “Is it that some will never see a Black man as qualified, no matter his achievements?” Willis said last month at Big Bethel AME Church in Atlanta, referencing Wade without specifically naming him. Speaking on CNN “This Morning” in January, Michael Moore, a former US Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said that the allegations against Willis would not be “destructive” to the vast racketeering case against Trump and his fellow defendants. At the same time, however, a change of prosecutor could substantially delay the proceedings, in a way that plays into some of Trump goals. At one point, CNN reported, Trump had shown an interest in attending Thursday’s hearing in Georgia rather than the one in NewYork, but he was convinced that since he was personally affected by the latter case it would make more sense for him to be there. In the likely event that the judge in NewYork rejects Trump dismissal motion, the ex-president is certain to claim that he is being political victimized. And if Willis is not dismissed from the case in Georgia, he is sure to use the mere existence of allegations against her to argue that justice has been tainted and that those seeking to call him to account are corrupt. This does not only have the political effect of solidifying Trump appeal to supporters as he claims he’s a victim of witch hunts. It also bolsters his long-term attempts to create a public narrative that any future convictions against him will be unjust.","['two', 'cases', 'defy', 'trump', 'capacity', 'thwart', 'prosecutions',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/donald-trump-ny-defense-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — The coming months are going to provide former Trump with the reality of campaigning from outside a courtroom. He has, heretofore, chosen to attend various court dates. When his criminal trial in Manhattan gets under way in late March , he could conceivably have locked up the GOP nomination but will have to attend the anticipated six-week trial or ask the judge to be excused. We got a preview of this unprecedented criminal trial mixed with a presidential campaign on Thursday at a key hearing in the NewYork criminal case. This time, Trump had a choice – he might also have attended a hearing in Georgia, where District Attorney Fani Willis, who is overseeing his election interference case in the state, faces allegations of misconduct related to her relationship with a prosecutor she appointed to oversee the case, a soap opera on the side of the Trump trials. Trump routinely manipulates the media spectacle outside court by rambling on about his criminal prosecutions and his political rivals. The details vary, but the main talking points stay largely the same and are repeated on a loop: political persecution, crime-ridden cities and his strong polling. Here’s some of what Trump said Thursday in NewYork before heading into the courtroom, along with context. Everything that I’ve heard and read, even from legal scholars, said there’s absolutely no case here. It’s not a crime. This is not a crime. It’s not clear what legal scholars Trump is referring to, but he says he’s not guilty of crimes in all four of the criminal cases he’s facing. He will repeat variations of “this is not a crime” as a kind of mantra throughout these comments. This particular case, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg , relates to hush-money payments to squash three separate, negative stories before the 2016 election. Payments were made to a former Trump Tower doorman by the parent company of the National Enquirer, American Media Inc., to buy the doorman’s story about an alleged Trump affair and Trump-fathered child. It was a “catch and kill” effort by the Enquirer, which never published the story it had bought. The Trump Organization has denied the affair allegation. Six-figure payments were also made by AMI to “catch and kill” the story of a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with Trump. He denies it. Trump former attorney Michael Cohen also paid $130,000 to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels through a shell company days before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels said she had an affair with Trump in 2006. Trump denies the allegation. But he compensated Cohen for the Daniels payment, and his company described the payment to Daniels as legal expenses. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payments and served time in jail. Trump was never charged by federal prosecutors, perhaps in part because the Department of Justice has a policy of not prosecuting presidents. The crime Trump is now accused of in NewYork is 34 counts of falsifying business records and misrepresenting the payments in order to influence the 2016 election. When you look at what’s going on outside on the streets, where violent crime is at an all-time high, I think it’s very, very – it’s a great double standard. Claiming violent crime in cites, especially those run by Democrat, is one of Trump favorite talking points. The idea that violent crime is at an “all-time high” is completely untrue, as CNN’s Daniel Dale wrote last October. Crime rates have fallen since then. In data released by the NewYork City Police Department , rates of murder, rape, assault, burglary and car theft were all down in January 2024 compared with January 2023. Robbery and grand larceny increased. Dale pointed out in his fact check that the actual violent crime rates were much higher decades ago, when these horrible records were set. It’s also worth noting that Trump is trying to compare his white-collar crimes with violent crimes, which seems like a false comparison. There are nonviolent crimes that are still crimes. Whether Trump is guilty will be up to a jury. We’re here for something that is not a crime. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. What it is is election interference. It’s being run by Biden White House. His top person was placed here in order to make sure everything goes right. This is a terrible time for our country. This is a real dark period for our country. Trump often repeats this claim that his four, separate criminal trials are a coordinated “election interference” scheme. Not only does it flip the script on the fact that it is he who has been charged in state court in Georgia and federal court in Washington, DC, with election interference, but it also plays into his larger claim that anything opposed to him is part of a “witch hunt.” It’s false and ridiculous to think that these cases are all coordinated by the Biden administration. A special counsel, Jack Smith , appointed to be autonomous from the Justice Department, is overseeing the two federal criminal prosecutions. Bragg is overseeing this hush-money prosecution. Willis is overseeing the Georgia state election case. Anyone ranking the severity of trials against Trump would probably like to see his federal election interference trial go first on the calendar. But the judge in Manhattan has filled Trump calendar at the end of March, when that federal trial could theoretically have taken place. The federal trial date is on hold while the SupremeCourt considers Trump argument that he has absolute immunity from prosecution for acts conducted while he was president. top person, Colangelo, and some others have been placed into the DA’s office to make sure they do a good job of election interference. There’s never been anything like this in the history of our country. What is this? While Trump first alleged that Biden “stuffed” the Manhattan DA’s office last year before he was indicted, this new detail is a head scratcher. Dale explains that Matthew Colangelo is a former Justice Department official who is now a senior counsel to Bragg. Their relationship predates Colangelo’s time at the Department of Justice. There is also a pattern of Trump seeking to question people in the justice system. In his civil fraud trial in the case brought by NewYork Attorney General Letitia James, for instance, he seized on a clerk to the judge and alleged she was tied to Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader. The details will change, but Trump finding a person to demonize is predictable. With all of this being said, I look outside, I look at the streets. It’s so different from when I left NewYork. It’s so different. It’s dirty and it’s crime-ridden. And today, you walk down the street, you get mugged or you get shot. And they are doing this where literally legal experts, legal scholars said they don’t understand that there’s no crime, and there was no crime here at all. He’s looping. See above. This is just a way of hurting me in the election because I’m leading by a lot. We’re leading by numbers that nobody’s ever seen before. Trump is certainly leading, and perhaps untouchable, in the race for the Republican nomination. In many polls, he does currently have a slim lead in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But his lead is far from unprecedented. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan are Republican who won true landslide victories, carrying nearly every state in a general election. No one is talking about that kind of victory for Trump. They figure this is their way of cheating this time. Last time, they had a different way. This time, they have something that’s really down and dirty that, no, frankly, no country does other than a third-world country, a banana republic. There is not now and there has never been evidence of systemic or widespread cheating to defeat Trump in either 2016 or 2020, although he has alleged as much for both elections. It is certainly true that political rivals in weak democracies and autocracies face political prosecutions. Look at Alexey Navalny and multiple other critics of President Vladimir Putin who have been jailed after questionable prosecutions in Russia. But to compare the US judicial system to that of a banana republic is ridiculous. Juries will determine Trump guilt or innocence. A SupremeCourt with three Trump-appointed justices has final review of the system that is prosecuting him. So we’re going to do our process. They want to rush it because they want to get it desperately before the election. By “they,” Trump presumably means all of the distinct authorities trying to prosecute him. By “our process,” he means his strategy of delay, delay, delay. Trump legal strategy is to win the election. If he wins in November, the likely outcome is that his two federal cases, if unresolved, would go away. State prosecutions are different. It’s not clear that a state could not prosecute a president or a president-elect, but any prosecutions would certainly be complicated. After the election, they wouldn’t have brought, this except for the fact, no way, except for the fact I’m running for president and doing well. If I were doing poorly, they wouldn’t have brought it. Trump prosecutions actually seem to have helped him in the Republican nomination race. His base has rallied around him, and his rivals have been unable to gain a serious foothold. We want delays, obviously, I’m running for election. I can’t – how can you run for election if you’re sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in SouthCarolina right now, where other people are, and where, again, this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be at a courthouse. Actually, given the choice, Trump has frequently attended court hearings over campaign events – either in his criminal cases or in his $370 million civil fraud trial, where a verdict is expected as soon as Friday. Dale writes in a fact check that, no, Trump was not stuck in court today. The former president did not need to appear for this hearing. He had no SouthCarolina events scheduled and plans to fly back to Florida after the hearing. When he says “other people,” he’s referring to former SouthCarolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his last remaining serious rival for the Republican nomination. Polling suggests he has a commanding lead over Haley in her home state as the GOP primary there approaches. Virtually every legal scholar says they don’t understand it, that there’s no crime. Even if he was guilty of something, there’s no crime. So I will say that, uh, enjoy it. Here, he’s both looping and making the provocative claim that he could be guilty but not be a criminal. It’s a sad thing. It’s a sad day for NewYork. They really do, look, I love this city and I love this state. They have to focus on violent crime taking place outside. You have a new form of crime now. You have migrant crime. Migrants are trying to beat up our police officers. They’re trying to do things that we’ve never seen before, actually. We are going to have a problem with – I call it Biden migrant crime, because you have millions of people who came into this place, this country that has been so badly hurt and they are they are doing things that nobody’s ever seen before. So you have violent migrant crime. Trump has built his presidential campaign around two main pillars: retribution for his 2020 loss, which he still does not accept, and being tougher on border policy. Here he marries the twin pillars of his campaign with the phrase “Biden migrant crime.” In NewYork, officials are dealing with a crush of asylum-seeking migrants who have been bused to the city from Texas and elsewhere. NewYork’s mayor has complained about the strain on the city and its services. And he has also recently helped feed the notion that crime in the city is being perpetrated by migrants, who under federal rules cannot obtain a work permit until they have been in the country for six months. More than 150,000 migrants have arrived in NewYork City, and there have been viral videos of migrants involved in criminal activity. But as The NewYork Times notes , despite the rising number of migrants in the city, violent crime has dropped. And they’re after me for doing nothing wrong. You know, I paid almost $300 million in taxes over the period of time. $300 million. And they say, oh, let’s get Trump out. You have people that – it’s everything is politics in this city, including decisions and judges and everything else. It has to straighten out and they have to focus on violent crime, not made-up crime. Wait, what? Trump has persistently refused to release his tax returns so his claim that he paid $300 million in taxes “over the period of time” is unverifiable. If a person is a money-making billionaire, it’s possible that paying $300 million represents a lower tax rate than many other Americans. Is he referring to federal taxes? State taxes? We do know, because some years of his returns were leaked, that there were years in which he paid no federal income tax because he claimed massive losses from previous years. In the year he won the White House and in his first year as president, he paid $750 in federal income taxes. We also know that Trump general outlook on taxes is to pay as little as possible.","['version', 'appeared', 'cnn’s', 'matters', 'newsletter', 'inbox', 'sign', 'free', 'coming', 'months', 'going',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/fact-check-trump-new-york-hush-money/index.html,"Trump , now the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, made false and evidence-free claims to reporters on Thursday before and after he attended a Manhattan court hearing in the hush money criminal case against him. Here is a fact check of some of Trump remarks. Trump court attendance and campaign schedule Before entering the courtroom, Trump claimed that the hush money case against him is “election interference.” He also argued that it is literally interfering with his ability to campaign in SouthCarolina in advance of the February 24 Republican presidential primary there. “How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in SouthCarolina right now, where other people are, and where, again – this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said. Trump was even more explicit in comments after leaving the courtroom later in the morning, saying, “So instead of being in SouthCarolina and other states, campaigning, I’m stuck here.” Facts First : Trump wasn’t “stuck” in the courthouse in NewYork on Thursday. In fact, he was not required to attend any part of the hearing, since Judge Juan Merchan had waived his pretrial appearances in the hush money case . Rather, Trump voluntarily chose to appear at the hearing after considering instead attending a Thursday hearing in Georgia that is related to the charges he faces there . And he had not been scheduled to be in SouthCarolina on Thursday even before he made the decision to attend the NewYork hearing; his next scheduled campaign appearance in the state is next week. His next rally after the Thursday hearing is a Saturday event in Michigan . Trump was not planning to fly to SouthCarolina after the NewYork hearing. He was planning to fly back to Florida, where he lives. Though he has appeared only occasionally at court hearings, Trump has spent little time campaigning in SouthCarolina so far in the 2024 campaign. His two rallies in the state in the past week were his first there in 2024 . Biden and the hush money case Before entering the courtroom, Trump claimed that Biden’s White House is running the hush money case that was brought against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg . “What it is, is election interference. It’s being run by Biden White House. His top person was placed here in order to make sure everything goes right,” Trump said. He continued, “His top person, Colangelo, and some others have been placed into the DA’s office to make sure they do a good job of election interference.” Facts First: There is no basis for Trump claims. First, there is no evidence that Biden White House has any role in running the Manhattan district attorney’s case. Second, there is no evidence that the White House nor the Biden administration had anything to do with senior Justice Department official Matthew Colangelo’s decision to leave the department and join the district attorney’s office in 2022 as senior counsel to Bragg . Colangelo and Bragg knew each other before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney. Colangelo and Bragg previously worked at the same time in the office of NewYork’s state attorney general, where Colangelo investigated Trump charity and Trump financial practices and was involved in bringing various lawsuits against the Trump administration. On a minor point, Colangelo was never Biden very top official at the Justice Department. Colangelo served as acting associate attorney general in the first months of the Biden administration in early 2021 and then as principal deputy associate attorney general. As acting associate attorney general, he was third in command of the department. Justice Department prosecutors declined both in the middle and at the end of Trump presidential term to pursue federal charges against Trump over the hush money case, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig reported in a 2023 book . Honig reported that federal prosecutors in NewYork decided against pursuing charges in 2018 on account of longstanding Justice Department guidance that a sitting president can’t be indicted. Honig reported that in January 2021, just before Trump left office that month, federal prosecutors in NewYork held discussions about possibly reviving the case but again decided not to seek an indictment. Violent crime in NewYork Before entering the courtroom Trump denounced the hush money case against him and said, “This is not a crime. And when you look what’s going on outside [inaudible; in or on] the streets, where violent crime is at an all-time high, I think it’s a very, very – it’s a great double standard.” Trump has made similar claims about crime levels in NewYork City on various previous occasions while attacking the cases he faces in NewYork – and CNN has repeatedly debunked them. Facts First : Trump claim remains false. Violent crime is nowhere near a record high in either Manhattan in particular or NewYork City as a whole. Both Manhattan and NewYork City have experienced massive declines in crime since the record levels of the early 1990s. NewYork City publishes crime statistics on its website, so the facts are easy to find. In 1990, when the city set its all-time record for murders, there were 503 recorded murders in Manhattan, which is one of the city’s five boroughs. In 2023, Manhattan recorded 73 murders – a decline of about 85% from 1990. Manhattan is also way below record levels for other kinds of violent crime. For example, Manhattan recorded 252 rapes in 2023, down about 63% from the 689 in 1990, and 3,841 robberies in 2023, down about 86% from the 26,907 in 1990. The declines are similarly large for NewYork City as a whole . The city recorded 391 murders in 2023, down about 83% from the 2,262 in 1990; 1,455 rapes in 2023, down about 53% from the 3,126 in 1990; and 16,910 robberies in 2023, down about 83% from the 100,280 in 1990.","['trump', 'leading', 'candidate', 'republican', 'presidential', 'nomination', 'made', 'false', 'evidencefree', 'claims', 'reporters', 'thursday', 'attended', 'manhattan', 'court',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/bureau-of-prisons-inspector-general-report/index.html,"Chronic failures by the Bureau of Prisons contributed to the deaths of hundreds of federal prison inmates, the Department of Justice’s Inspector General said in a blistering report released Thursday. The report found that recurring failures within the Bureau of Prisons, such as inaccurate mental health screenings or prison staff missing inmate rounds, led to inmates dying in federal custody. Longstanding institutional issues also limited BOP’s ability to investigate inmate deaths and prevent similar conditions in the future, it said. For years, the embattled Bureau of Prisons has been the subject of accusations by politicians, prisoner advocacy groups for mistreating or neglecting inmates. The Justice Department itself has issued scathing rebukes against BOP, outlining serious mistakes that have led to the deaths of high-profile inmates like notorious Boston gangster and convicted murderer James “Whitey” Bulger , who was killed shortly after being transferred to a new prison, and financier Jeffrey Epstein , who died by suicide in his jail cell. But the circumstances that led to Bulger and Epstein’s deaths are emblematic of wide-ranging and recurring issues within the federal prison system that affect hundreds of inmates across the country, the DOJ’s Office of Inspector General found in its report that outlined a system in crisis failing to protect its charges. The 100-page report analyzed the circumstances of 344 inmates who died by suicide, homicide, accidents or other unknown factors between 2014 and 2021. The OIG recommended several changes to BOP procedure, including developing strategies to ensure that inmate mental health is properly evaluated, that prison staff is taught to use defibrillators and naloxone, and to develop procedures that require inmate death records to be consistently completed and collected. In response to the report, a BOP spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that BOP “acknowledges and concurs with the need for improvements” and is “dedicated to implementing these changes to ensure the safety and well-being of those in our custody.” Issues with existing BOP standards In several of the homicide and suicide cases examined by the OIG, inmates died after prison staff failed to meet standards outlined within BOPs own policies. The report pointed to correctional officers who didn’t complete their assigned duties, improperly filled out paperwork, didn’t bring life-saving equipment when responding to an emergency, gave inaccurate or unclear information on the radio to medical staff, or didn’t know how to administer overdose medication naloxone. For example, correctional staff failed to conduct the required rounds or inmate counts in restrictive housing units before the deaths of at least 86 inmates. In another 17 cases, staff failed to search or did not sufficiently search inmates cells, allowing them to possess excess medication, bed sheets or razors. Investigators pointed to Epstein, noting that before his death he was able to amass an “excessive amount of linens.” In another case, prison staff claimed to have searched an inmate’s cell three times without finding contraband. Days later, the inmate died by a drug overdose after amassing more than 1,000 pills in their cell, the report says. Some staff also allowed inmates to evade metal detectors, the report said, including in 11 homicide cases where inmates weren’t searched, were allowed to walk around metal detectors or not confronted after setting off metal detectors. The OIG also said that guidelines to help prison staff investigate deaths once they had occurred often were adhered to. BOP was “unable to produce documentation required by its own policy for 43% of the inmate deaths in our scope,” the report says, including 117 cases where the BOP failed to acquire death certificates. Prison suicide Recurring violations of BOP’s own policies and operational failures inside prisons led to a staggering amount of inmate suicides, the OIG found, accounting for more than half of the deaths analyzed in their report. Prison staff frequently did not properly evaluate inmates’ mental health, often categorizing inmates who later died by suicide with little to no mental health risks. Other inmates with documented mental health risks were isolated in a special housing unit or did not receive the counseling they were supposed to and later died by suicide. In one example highlighted in the report, prison health services staff did not refer an inmate who had swallowed razor blades for psychological help. The inmate went on to be repeatedly placed in the SHU for engaging in violence without the knowledge of the mental health staff at the facility, where he later died by hanging. Staffing crisis A staggering lack of health care and correctional staff within the prisons has also led to a diminished quality of inmate care, the OIG found. In one particularly egregious example, the OIG described the lack of access to healthcare in the notorious Federal Correctional Institution Thomson in Illinois. When the OIG visited Thomson in 2022, according to the report, it had not had an on-side full-time physician for over a year. Additionally, nearly half of its nursing positions were vacant, the report said. These vacancies can drastically affect quality of health care, the report said, or overwhelm staff so dramatically that they quit. Staffing shortages have also forced some institutions to mandate available staff to work overtime shifts, in some cases working 16-hour days several times a week. Other staff members are asked to augment their responsibilities, at times forcing non-correctional officer staff to perform correctional duties – including one case where psychologists were assigned to correctional posts for more than two months.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/white-house-russia-anti-satellite/index.html,"The White House on Thursday confirmed that the national security threat flagged by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee the previous day is related to “an anti-satellite capability that Russia is developing,” but sought to soothe concerns about the danger it presents to the United States. “This is not an active capability that’s been deployed,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. “And though Russia’s pursuit of this particular capability is troubling there was no immediate threat to anyone’s safety.” “We are not talking about a weapon that can be used to attack human beings or cause physical destruction here on Earth,” Kirby added. Kirby’s comments came a day after the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, ignited a firestorm on Capitol Hill when he issued a cryptic statement announcing that the panel had “information concerning a serious national security threat.” The lack of immediate details about the nature of the threat left many filling in their own blanks about its severity and imminence. Turner has faced withering criticism, even from members of his own party, for publicizing the committee’s knowledge in a vague post to social media, with Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida accusing him of “gaslighting the country,” and Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee demanding an investigation into Turner. Both Gaetz and Ogles said they believe Turner was motivated to make the information public to rouse support for additional funding for Ukraine in its war against Russia. The Kremlin repeated that talking point on Thursday, Reuters reported . Kirby responded to the Kremlin’s claim with one word: “Bollocks.” He later added that the US is still in the process of reaching out to Russia for conversations on Moscow’s anti-satellite capabilities. “We’ll have to see” whether public disclosure of the threat might make those conversations more difficult, he said. Turner has publicly supported continuing to fund the Ukraine war effort, even as former Trump has supported the GOP push to oppose a $60 billion aid package to support Ukraine. Other members of the Intelligence Committee came to Turner’s defense. Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw defended Turner’s decision to publicize the information. Referencing the allegations that Turner planned the release to coincide with efforts to provide additional funding, Crenshaw said the timing was a coincidence. “There was notifications from the intelligence community that made it just clearer now than before,” Crenshaw said. “This was just the time.” The post from Turner called on Biden to declassify “all information” related to the threat. Kirby said the US intelligence community had “serious concerns” about a broad declassification of intelligence related to the threat. He added that private engagement, “rather than immediately publicizing the intelligence, could be a much more effective approach.” The United States has been aware of Russia’s pursuit of anti-satellite capability going back “many, many months, if not a few years,” Kirby said, and Biden has been briefed on it since the outset of his term. He said it was only in recent weeks that the intelligence community has been “able to assess with a higher sense of confidence exactly how Russia continues to pursue it.” As to whether the intelligence should be downgraded, Kirby said the administration has been following a rigorous process, and wouldn’t be “knocked off” that by Turner’s decision to publicize the threat on Wednesday. He denied the administration provided a green light to Turner to make the information public. While Kirby said the Russian capabilities do not pose a threat to human life, an anti-satellite weapon placed in orbit around Earth would pose a significant danger to US nuclear command and control satellites, Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN on Wednesday. The US relies on such satellites – which he called “essential” – to ensure constant, seamless control over its nuclear arsenal. Russia has pursued counterspace systems designed to neutralize US military and commercial space systems for years, according to a 2022 Defense Intelligence Agency report on space security. Russian doctrine called for being able to target an enemy’s satellites from the ground, air, cyber and space, using attacks that range from temporary jamming to outright destruction.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/emhoff-meeting-jewish-arab-youth-gaza/index.html,"Second gentleman Doug Emhoff slipped into NewYork on Thursday for a small meeting with youth leaders selected from across the Jewish American, Muslim American and Palestinian American communities, marking the administration’s latest move in its evolving response to the Israel-Hamas war . The event, hosted by United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Rashad Hussain, the US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, was kept quiet by administration officials hoping to facilitate a conversation, rather than a debate or another opportunity for the protests that have followed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris across the country. But Emhoff is not involved with administration policy, so the discussion was not about a ceasefire nor negotiations over a hostage release nor the White House’s maneuvering with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Nor was it about ongoing political fallout, according to a person in the room. It focused on how the situation has affected people in America, billed as “a roundtable discussion on the sharp rise in Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate after the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel.” In January, the Anti-Defamation League recorded a 361% rise in reported antisemitic incidents in the three months after the Hamas attack began on October 7 compared to the same period in 2022. In November, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it had received an “unprecedented” rise in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents in the month following the start of the war. “These communities have felt real pain, fear, and isolation,” Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement to CNN. “In this moment in which it’s all too easy to focus on what divides us, we must carve out moments like today’s roundtable to remember what unites us: to find shared humanity, and shared purpose, in one another’s stories, and work together to create a lasting peace for all.” Though he was working on the issue before, Emhoff’s portfolio as second gentleman has increasingly been consumed with countering hate across the country since October 7. He’s had community conversations with leaders in Michigan, California and at Cornell University in NewYork. But Thursday’s event – coordinated by Andrew Weinstein, who was appointed by Biden in 2022 to serve as a public delegate to the United Nations – was the first structured specifically around youth leaders, and across Jewish Americans and Arab Americans at once. The event itself was kept closed to the public and press, but the person in the room described an honest conversation defined by participants talking about their own experiences over the last few months, with Emhoff, Thomas-Greenfield and Hussain mostly listening. Emhoff finished by talking about the need to keep building coalitions and executing on the national strategy to combat antisemitism and the coming strategy on combating Islamophobia, the person in the room said. An aide to the US mission to the United Nations explained that the names of the participants were kept private to protect sensitive discussions. “Obviously everyone didn’t agree on policy, but everyone agreed on the need to combat hate and to work against dehumanization,” said another person familiar with the event.","['second', 'gentleman', 'doug', 'emhoff', 'slipped', 'newyork', 'thursday', 'small', 'meeting', 'youth', 'leaders', 'selected', 'across', 'jewish', 'american', 'muslim', 'american', 'palestinian', 'american', 'communities', 'marking', 'administration’s', 'latest', 'move', 'evolving', 'response', 'israelhamas', 'war', 'event', 'hosted', 'united', 'nations', 'ambassador', 'linda', 'thomasgreenfield', 'rashad', 'hussain', 'us', 'ambassadoratlarge', 'international', 'religious', 'freedom', 'kept', 'quiet', 'administration', 'officials', 'hoping', 'facilitate', 'conversation', 'rather', 'debate', 'another', 'opportunity', 'protests', 'followed', 'biden', 'vice', 'president', 'kamala', 'harris', 'across', 'country', 'emhoff', 'involved', 'administration', 'policy', 'discussion', 'ceasefire', 'negotiations', 'hostage', 'release', 'white', 'house’s', 'maneuvering', 'israeli', 'prime', 'minister', 'benjamin', 'netanyahu', 'ongoing', 'political', 'fallout', 'according', 'person', 'room', 'focused', 'situation', 'affected', 'people', 'america', 'billed', '“a', 'roundtable', 'discussion', 'sharp', 'rise', 'antisemitism', 'islamophobia', 'forms', 'hate', 'october', '7', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'israel”', 'january', 'antidefamation', 'league', 'recorded', '361', 'rise', 'reported', 'antisemitic', 'incidents', 'three', 'months', 'hamas', 'attack', 'began', 'october', '7', 'compared', 'period', '2022', 'november', 'council', 'americanislamic', 'relations', 'received', '“unprecedented”', 'rise', 'reported', 'antiarab', 'antimuslim', 'bias', 'incidents', 'month', 'following', 'start', 'war', '“these', 'communities', 'felt', 'real', 'pain', 'fear', 'isolation”', 'thomasgreenfield', 'statement', '“in', 'moment', 'easy', 'focus', 'divides', 'us', 'must', 'carve', 'moments', 'like', 'today’s', 'roundtable', 'remember', 'unites', 'us', 'find', 'shared', 'humanity', 'shared', 'purpose', 'one', 'another’s', 'stories', 'work', 'together', 'create', 'lasting', 'peace', 'all”', 'though', 'working', 'issue', 'emhoff’s', 'portfolio', 'second', 'gentleman', 'increasingly', 'consumed', 'countering', 'hate', 'across', 'country', 'since', 'october', '7', 'he’s', 'community', 'conversations', 'leaders', 'michigan', 'california', 'cornell', 'university', 'newyork', 'thursday’s', 'event', 'coordinated', 'andrew', 'weinstein', 'appointed', 'biden', '2022', 'serve', 'public', 'delegate', 'united', 'nations', 'first', 'structured', 'specifically', 'around', 'youth', 'leaders', 'across', 'jewish', 'americans', 'arab', 'americans', 'event', 'kept', 'closed', 'public', 'press', 'person', 'room', 'described', 'honest', 'conversation', 'defined', 'participants', 'talking', 'experiences', 'last', 'months', 'emhoff', 'thomasgreenfield', 'hussain', 'mostly', 'listening', 'emhoff', 'finished', 'talking', 'need', 'keep', 'building', 'coalitions', 'executing', 'national', 'strategy', 'combat', 'antisemitism', 'coming', 'strategy', 'combating', 'islamophobia', 'person', 'room', 'aide', 'us', 'mission', 'united', 'nations', 'explained', 'names', 'participants', 'kept', 'private', 'protect', 'sensitive', 'discussions', '“obviously', 'everyone', 'didn’t', 'agree', 'policy', 'everyone', 'agreed', 'need', 'combat', 'hate', 'work', 'dehumanization”', 'another', 'person', 'familiar', 'event']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/trump-makes-final-pitch-to-supreme-court-in-fraught-immunity-case/index.html,"Trump made his final pitch Thursday to the SupremeCourt in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. “There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the SupremeCourt in a 16-page filing . “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.” Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument. The SupremeCourt is expected to decide on Trump request within a few days. With Trump final brief in hand, a question of timing is now squarely before the high court. The justices could deny Trump emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue or they could agree to further consider his case. A view of the U.S. SupremeCourt on Thursday morning January 4, 2024 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Related article Special counsel urges SupremeCourt to deny Trump request for delay in immunity case The first outcome would clear the way for a US District court in Washington, DC, to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to resolve before the November election. The second could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months. On Monday, Trump asked the SupremeCourt to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down last week that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. “Without immunity from criminal prosecution, the presidency as we know it will cease to exist,” Trump told the SupremeCourt. Two days later – ahead of deadline – Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause. “The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy,” Smith wrote in a filing Wednesday. “The public interest in a prompt trial is at its zenith where, as here, a former president is charged with conspiring to subvert the electoral process so that he could remain in office.”","['trump', 'made', 'final', 'pitch', 'thursday', 'supremecourt', 'effort', 'pause', 'trial', 'election', 'subversion', 'charges', 'brought', 'special', 'counsel', 'jack', 'smith', '“there', 'overwhelming', 'reasons', 'case', 'go', 'trial', '‘in', 'three', 'months', 'less’”', 'trump', 'supremecourt', '16page', 'filing', '“with', 'defendant', 'virtually', 'unthinkable', 'case', 'go', 'trial', 'soon', '‘wildly', 'unfair’', 'so”', 'trump', 'claims', 'presidents', 'must', 'immunity', 'charges', 'avoid', 'political', 'reprisals', 'leave', 'office', 'far', 'two', 'lower', 'federal', 'courts', 'balked', 'argument', 'supremecourt', 'expected', 'decide', 'trump', 'request', 'within', 'days', 'trump', 'final', 'brief', 'hand', 'question', 'timing', 'squarely', 'high', 'court', 'justices', 'deny', 'trump', 'emergency', 'request', 'temporarily', 'block', 'dc', 'circuit', 'ruling', 'immunity', 'issue', 'agree', 'consider', 'case', 'view', 'us', 'supremecourt', 'thursday', 'morning', 'january', '4', '2024', 'washington', 'dc', 'drew', 'angerergetty', 'related', 'article', 'special', 'counsel', 'urges', 'supremecourt', 'deny', 'trump', 'request', 'delay', 'immunity', 'case', 'first', 'outcome', 'clear', 'way', 'us', 'district', 'court', 'washington', 'dc', 'schedule', 'trial', 'underlying', 'election', 'charges', 'smith', 'eager', 'resolve', 'november', 'election', 'second', 'signal', 'justices', 'may', 'schedule', 'oral', 'arguments', 'case', 'later', 'year', 'potentially', 'pushing', 'trial', 'back', 'several', 'months', 'monday', 'trump', 'asked', 'supremecourt', 'block', 'unanimous', 'decision', 'dc', 'circuit', 'handed', 'last', 'week', 'rejected', 'claims', 'immunity', 'election', 'subversion', 'charges', '“without', 'immunity', 'criminal', 'prosecution', 'presidency', 'know', 'cease', 'exist”', 'trump', 'supremecourt', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'ahead', 'deadline', 'smith', 'argued', 'brief', 'trump', 'met', 'standard', 'pause', 'proceedings', 'case', 'generally', 'takes', 'support', 'five', 'justices', 'secure', 'pause', '“the', 'charged', 'crimes', 'strike', 'heart', 'democracy”', 'smith', 'wrote', 'filing', 'wednesday', '“the', 'public', 'interest', 'prompt', 'trial', 'zenith', 'president', 'charged', 'conspiring', 'subvert', 'electoral', 'process', 'remain', 'office”']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/white-house-letter-special-counsel/index.html,"The White House wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland the day before special counsel Robert Hur’s report was released, vehemently objecting to aspects of the report – including its “multiple denigrating statements” about the president’s memory. The letter was the culmination of a months-long attempt by Biden team to weigh in on the investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents through letters to Hur and eventually to Hur’s boss, the attorney general. Ultimately, Hur did not appear to heed calls by Biden lawyers to produce a narrow and concise report limited to the facts of the charging decision. Instead, the 388-page report — which declined to bring charges — sparked a political firestorm by making repeated references to Biden inability to recall dates and details. “We object to the multiple denigrating statements about Biden’s memory which violate longstanding DOJ practice and policy,” Biden personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, and White House counsel, Edward Siskel, wrote in a three-page letter to Garland on February 7. “This report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” The lawyers wrote that “a global and pejorative judgment on the President’s powers of recollection in general is uncalled for and unfounded.” In the February 7 letter, Biden lawyers likened Hur’s efforts in his report to those of James Comey, the FBI director in 2016 who criticized then-candidate Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server, despite not bringing charges. The lawyers wrote Hur’s report “mirrors one of the most widely-recognized examples in recent history of inappropriate prosecutor criticism of uncharged conduct.” “The FBI and DOJ personnel’s criticism of uncharged conduct during investigations in connection with the 2016 election was found to violate ‘long-standing Department practice and protocol,’” the lawyers wrote. Politico and The NewYork Times published copies of the letter. The White House counsel’s office declined to comment. The letter underscores the deep anger generated by Hur’s report inside the White House and lays bare tensions between Biden team and Garland. CNN has previously reported that frustrations have run high inside the White House regarding some of Garland’s decisions related to the classified documents matter. The letter to Garland also objected to Hur’s characterization of Biden practice of retaining personal diaries, saying that even though “prior Presidents have done exactly the same thing,” the special counsel described the behavior as “totally irresponsible.” Hur’s report, which concluded that criminal charges were not warranted against Biden regarding his handling of classified documents, made numerous references to the president’s memory and recall issues that were allegedly exhibited during his multi-hour interview with Hur in October. Since the report’s release, the White House and the president’s lawyers have strenuously objected to the handling of the investigation and, in particular, the references to Biden memory issues as gratuitous and inappropriate. A day after Hur’s report was released publicly, a top Justice Department official responded by defending the document and its inclusion of details about Biden memory. “The context in which this information is used in the report makes it appropriate under Department policy and the Special Counsel regulations. The identified language is neither gratuitous nor unduly prejudicial because it is not offered to criticize or demean the President,” wrote Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer to Biden team. Weinsheimer, the department’s top career official, also pushed back on Biden lawyers’ comparison to Comey, calling it “inapt,” as Comey was an FBI director and not a special counsel. He said Hur’s report was “readily distinguishable from Director Comey’s press conference” about the Clinton email server. On February 12, four days after the Hur report was released, Bauer and Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, responded to Weinsheimer – to once again disagree with the DOJ’s assessment that Hur’s report was consistent with the department’s policy and practice","['white', 'house', 'wrote', 'attorney', 'general', 'merrick', 'garland', 'day', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'hur’s', 'report', 'released', 'vehemently', 'objecting', 'aspects', 'report', 'including', '“multiple', 'denigrating', 'statements”', 'president’s', 'memory', 'letter', 'culmination', 'monthslong', 'attempt', 'biden', 'team', 'weigh', 'investigation', 'biden’s', 'handling', 'classified', 'documents', 'letters', 'hur', 'eventually', 'hur’s', 'boss', 'attorney', 'general', 'ultimately', 'hur', 'appear', 'heed', 'calls', 'biden', 'lawyers', 'produce', 'narrow', 'concise', 'report', 'limited', 'facts', 'charging', 'decision', 'instead', '388page', 'report', 'declined', 'bring', 'charges', 'sparked', 'political', 'firestorm', 'making', 'repeated', 'references', 'biden', 'inability', 'recall', 'dates', 'details', '“we', 'object', 'multiple', 'denigrating', 'statements', 'biden’s', 'memory', 'violate', 'longstanding', 'doj', 'practice', 'policy”', 'biden', 'personal', 'lawyer', 'bob', 'bauer', 'white', 'house', 'counsel', 'edward', 'siskel', 'wrote', 'threepage', 'letter', 'garland', 'february', '7', '“this', 'report', 'goes', 'include', 'allegations', 'president', 'failing', 'memory', 'general', 'sense', 'allegation', 'law', 'enforcement', 'purpose”', 'lawyers', 'wrote', '“a', 'global', 'pejorative', 'judgment', 'president’s', 'powers', 'recollection', 'general', 'uncalled', 'unfounded”', 'february', '7', 'letter', 'biden', 'lawyers', 'likened', 'hur’s', 'efforts', 'report', 'james', 'comey', 'fbi', 'director', '2016', 'criticized', 'thencandidate', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'use', 'private', 'email', 'server', 'despite', 'bringing', 'charges', 'lawyers', 'wrote', 'hur’s', 'report', '“mirrors', 'one', 'widelyrecognized', 'examples', 'recent', 'history', 'inappropriate', 'prosecutor', 'criticism', 'uncharged', 'conduct”', '“the', 'fbi', 'doj', 'personnel’s', 'criticism', 'uncharged', 'conduct', 'investigations', 'connection', '2016', 'election', 'found', 'violate', '‘longstanding', 'department', 'practice', 'protocol’”', 'lawyers', 'wrote', 'politico', 'newyork', 'times', 'published', 'copies', 'letter', 'white', 'house', 'counsel’s', 'office', 'declined', 'comment', 'letter', 'underscores', 'deep', 'anger', 'generated', 'hur’s', 'report', 'inside', 'white', 'house', 'lays', 'bare', 'tensions', 'biden', 'team', 'garland', 'previously', 'reported', 'frustrations', 'run', 'high', 'inside', 'white', 'house', 'regarding', 'garland’s', 'decisions', 'related', 'classified', 'documents', 'matter', 'letter', 'garland', 'objected', 'hur’s', 'characterization', 'biden', 'practice', 'retaining', 'personal', 'diaries', 'saying', 'though', '“prior', 'presidents', 'done', 'exactly', 'thing”', 'special', 'counsel', 'described', 'behavior', '“totally', 'irresponsible”', 'hur’s', 'report', 'concluded', 'criminal', 'charges', 'warranted', 'biden', 'regarding', 'handling', 'classified', 'documents', 'made', 'numerous', 'references', 'president’s', 'memory', 'recall', 'issues', 'allegedly', 'exhibited', 'multihour', 'interview', 'hur', 'october', 'since', 'report’s', 'release', 'white', 'house', 'president’s', 'lawyers', 'strenuously', 'objected', 'handling', 'investigation', 'particular', 'references', 'biden', 'memory', 'issues', 'gratuitous', 'inappropriate', 'day', 'hur’s', 'report', 'released', 'publicly', 'top', 'justice', 'department', 'official', 'responded', 'defending', 'document', 'inclusion', 'details', 'biden', 'memory', '“the', 'context', 'information', 'used', 'report', 'makes', 'appropriate', 'department', 'policy', 'special', 'counsel', 'regulations', 'identified', 'language', 'neither', 'gratuitous', 'unduly', 'prejudicial', 'offered', 'criticize', 'demean', 'president”', 'wrote', 'associate', 'deputy', 'attorney', 'general', 'bradley', 'weinsheimer', 'biden', 'team', 'weinsheimer', 'department’s', 'top', 'career', 'official', 'pushed', 'back', 'biden', 'lawyers’', 'comparison', 'comey', 'calling', '“inapt”', 'comey', 'fbi', 'director', 'special', 'counsel', 'hur’s', 'report', '“readily', 'distinguishable', 'director', 'comey’s', 'press', 'conference”', 'clinton', 'email', 'server', 'february', '12', 'four', 'days', 'hur', 'report', 'released', 'bauer', 'richard', 'sauber', 'special', 'counsel', 'president', 'responded', 'weinsheimer', 'disagree', 'doj’s', 'assessment', 'hur’s', 'report', 'consistent', 'department’s', 'policy', 'practice']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/mike-turner-republican-reaction/index.html,"House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner is facing sharp criticism – including from within his own party – as some GOP lawmakers are complaining that a statement the Ohio Republican made Wednesday was alarmist, “constituted poor judgement” and should be investigated. Some of Turner’s colleagues believe he was drawing attention to a Russian threat to build support for Ukraine aid and others believe it was his effort to push for his version of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act overhaul that was facing a vote later in the day. “It’s f***ing bullsh*t,” one prominent House Republican told CNN of Turner’s move. “He ought to lose his job. He did that to get his way on FISA.” Others were just as unnerved by the move. “I don’t know what his motives were it just to me, it just looks bad,” Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I have a bad feeling about this.” Another Tennessee Republican, Rep. Andy Ogles, sent a scathing letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday calling for an investigation into Turner for his vague statements, calling his disclosure “reckless” and asserting he disregarded of the consequences. “This act constituted poor judgement at a minimum and a complete breach of trust influenced by the pursuit of a political agenda at a maximum … it is with great reticence that I formally request an inquiry as to any impact the Chairman’s statements may have had on U.S. foreign and domestic policy,” Ogles wrote. CNN has reached out to Johnson for comment on the letter. Not long after Turner released his statement warning of a “serious national security threat,” Johnson arranged a last-minute news conference in the Capitol to make clear there’s “no need for public alarm” and clarifying he had already requested a briefing on the matter a month ago. Turner did not give the House speaker’s office a heads up prior to making his public statement characterizing the matter as a “serious national security threat,” according to a source familiar with the matter. Turner did, however, inform Johnson he would be requesting that the Biden administration declassify information about the threat, another source said. GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas, a member of the Intelligence Committee, defended Turner’s actions and blasted members who want him investigated. Asked about the letter from Ogles, Crenshaw said, Ogles “needs to f***ing check himself.” “He doesn’t know what he is talking about,” Crenshaw said. “It’s absurd. It’s a deeply absurd action. I am tired of people making extremely passionate, opinionated actions based on no knowledge.” Asked about some of the theories members are floating that Turner was using his position to try and drum up support for Ukraine aid and other theories as to why Turner released the statement, Crenshaw said the timing was just coincidence. “It’s coincidence,” he said. “There was notifications from the intelligence community that made it just clearer now than before. This was just the time.” Turner issued a statement defending his decision to make the national security threat available to members, but the statement does not address why Turner decided to make his statement public, which has caused backlash. Turner said he worked with the Biden administration to notify Congress about the national security threat and that the administration cleared his statement with the top Democrat on the panel before it got sent to lawmakers. The committee voted on Tuesday to release the information to lawmakers, and Turner said that vote was 23-1. Turner’s initial statement came hours before the House was scheduled to take a vote related to reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a vote that was later postponed due to opposition from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members had been pushing for amendment vote. Members of the Freedom Caucus later tanked a procedural vote on unrelated legislation Wednesday evening. Ogles tied Turner’s statement to trying to drum up support for passing the FISA package. “In hindsight, it has become clear that the intent was not to ensure the safety of our homeland and the American people, but rather to ensure additional funding for Ukraine and passage of an unreformed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.” GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz accused Turner of “gaslighting the country” about the seriousness of the security threat members were briefed on Thursday in order to promote Ukraine funding. “We put out our concern with Chairman Turner gaslighting the country on these things,” Gaetz told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I worry that the motivation to draw so much attention to this is less about intelligence and national security and more about a politician who wants to send $60 billion to Ukraine,” he said, “and wants to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that we want to see substantially curtailed because of the spying abuses.” CNN reported Wednesday that the US has new intelligence on Russian military capabilities related to its efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space, according to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence. The intelligence was briefed to Congress and key US allies, and some lawmakers say it is serious enough that it should be declassified and made public. One Democrat member with deep national security experience said Wednesday that they had never before received that kind of urgent summons over a national security matter during their time in Congress — and that the intelligence they saw when they arrived was not urgent enough to justify Turner’s comments.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/texas-immigration-law-doj/index.html,"A federal judge on Thursday expressed concern and skepticism over a controversial law that makes entering Texas illegally a state crime while hearing oral arguments over a motion for a preliminary injunction to block the law. The measure, SB4, which is set to go into effect on March 5, grants local and state law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and state judges the ability to issue orders to remove them to Mexico. The Department of Justice sued the state , arguing the federal government has exclusive authority to enforce immigration law. US District Judge David Ezra emphasized that he was sympathetic to the state’s concerns about the complicated situation at the border and the issues plaguing the country’s immigration system, making it clear that something must be done to improve the nation’s immigration laws. He also added that he’s served as a federal judge in several cities along the border, including San Diego and Del Rio. But Ezra was not shy in critiquing the bill passed by the state’s legislature last year and fully embraced by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott . Civil rights groups and immigration advocacy groups who are also part of the lawsuit have warned that the bill will separate families, lead to racial profiling and make undocumented migrants who are already in the US fearful of reporting crimes. Ezra sharply questioned several provisions within the law and flat out rejected the state’s argument that an “invasion” was taking place at the Texas-Mexico border. The state argued in the Austin courtroom that SB4 is complementary — not in conflict — with federal law and that Texas is “entitled to defend itself from an invasion,” especially from what it called a “full-scale invasion of transnational criminal cartels.” While he acknowledged the role cartels play in the border crisis, Ezra pushed back at the notion that an influx of migrants constituted an “invasion.” “I really do not see any evidence that Texas is at war,” he said, though he said the state is “definitely under pressure.” Ezra also speculated that if he were to rule that SB4 was “perfectly fine,” it could ignite a domino effect of other states creating their own interpretations of federal immigration law — a situation he described as a “nightmare.” Ryan Walters, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, pointed out that states along the border largely enforced their own immigration laws and deported migrants until the late 1800s. Ezra countered that because the states were “doing their own thing,” Congress stepped in and created a unified law over who can come into the country. Ezra said the law still needs more work, “but that doesn’t mean the law we have isn’t enforceable.” Further, he said the removal provisions in the Texas legislation would burden state judges with making decisions that typically fall within the jurisdiction of immigration judges. He worried parts of the law would confuse judges over whether to follow state or federal statutes, especially when it comes to a migrant who’s legally seeking asylum while also facing felony prosecution from the state. “It is a quandary of some proportion,” Ezra said. The state argued that arresting migrants is not unprecedented for the state, as it’s been arresting migrants for trespassing for more than two years. But the judge argued there was a difference, saying SB4 “goes far beyond that” by allowing a judge to order a migrant to be removed once prosecuted. Ezra said he would rule “as quickly as I possibly can,” assuring both parties he would give enough time for either side to file an appeal. The judge made clear he did not see this case ending quickly. “I would not be surprised at all if this case finds its way to the SupremeCourt,” he said","['federal', 'judge', 'thursday', 'expressed', 'concern', 'skepticism', 'controversial', 'law', 'makes', 'entering', 'texas', 'illegally', 'state', 'crime', 'hearing', 'oral', 'arguments', 'motion', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'block', 'law', 'measure', 'sb4', 'set', 'go', 'effect', 'march', '5', 'grants', 'local', 'state', 'law', 'enforcement', 'power', 'arrest', 'migrants', 'state', 'judges', 'ability', 'issue', 'orders', 'remove', 'mexico', 'department', 'justice', 'sued', 'state', 'arguing', 'federal', 'government', 'exclusive', 'authority', 'enforce', 'immigration', 'law', 'us', 'district', 'judge', 'david', 'ezra', 'emphasized', 'sympathetic', 'state’s', 'concerns', 'complicated', 'situation', 'border', 'issues', 'plaguing', 'country’s', 'immigration', 'system', 'making', 'clear', 'something', 'must', 'done', 'improve', 'nation’s', 'immigration', 'laws', 'added', 'he’s', 'served', 'federal', 'judge', 'several', 'cities', 'along', 'border', 'including', 'san', 'diego', 'del', 'rio', 'ezra', 'shy', 'critiquing', 'bill', 'passed', 'state’s', 'legislature', 'last', 'year', 'fully', 'embraced', 'texas', 'republican', 'gov', 'greg', 'abbott', 'civil', 'rights', 'groups', 'immigration', 'advocacy', 'groups', 'part', 'lawsuit', 'warned', 'bill', 'separate', 'families', 'lead', 'racial', 'profiling', 'make', 'undocumented', 'migrants', 'already', 'us', 'fearful', 'reporting', 'crimes', 'ezra', 'sharply', 'questioned', 'several', 'provisions', 'within', 'law', 'flat', 'rejected', 'state’s', 'argument', '“invasion”', 'taking', 'place', 'texasmexico', 'border', 'state', 'argued', 'austin', 'courtroom', 'sb4', 'complementary', 'conflict', 'federal', 'law', 'texas', '“entitled', 'defend', 'invasion”', 'especially', 'called', '“fullscale', 'invasion', 'transnational', 'criminal', 'cartels”', 'acknowledged', 'role', 'cartels', 'play', 'border', 'crisis', 'ezra', 'pushed', 'back', 'notion', 'influx', 'migrants', 'constituted', '“invasion”', 'really', 'see', 'evidence', 'texas', 'war”', 'though', 'state', '“definitely', 'pressure”', 'ezra', 'speculated', 'rule', 'sb4', '“perfectly', 'fine”', 'ignite', 'domino', 'effect', 'states', 'creating', 'interpretations', 'federal', 'immigration', 'law', 'situation', 'described', '“nightmare”', 'ryan', 'walters', 'attorney', 'texas', 'attorney', 'general’s', 'office', 'pointed', 'states', 'along', 'border', 'largely', 'enforced', 'immigration', 'laws', 'deported', 'migrants', 'late', '1800s', 'ezra', 'countered', 'states', '“doing', 'thing”', 'congress', 'stepped', 'created', 'unified', 'law', 'come', 'country', 'ezra', 'law', 'still', 'needs', 'work', '“but', 'doesn’t', 'mean', 'law', 'isn’t', 'enforceable”', 'removal', 'provisions', 'texas', 'legislation', 'burden', 'state', 'judges', 'making', 'decisions', 'typically', 'fall', 'within', 'jurisdiction', 'immigration', 'judges', 'worried', 'parts', 'law', 'confuse', 'judges', 'whether', 'follow', 'state', 'federal', 'statutes', 'especially', 'comes', 'migrant', 'who’s', 'legally', 'seeking', 'asylum', 'facing', 'felony', 'prosecution', 'state', '“it', 'quandary', 'proportion”', 'ezra', 'state', 'argued', 'arresting', 'migrants', 'unprecedented', 'state', 'arresting', 'migrants', 'trespassing', 'two', 'years', 'judge', 'argued', 'difference', 'saying', 'sb4', '“goes', 'far', 'beyond', 'that”', 'allowing', 'judge', 'order', 'migrant', 'removed', 'prosecuted', 'ezra', 'rule', '“as', 'quickly', 'possibly', 'can”', 'assuring', 'parties', 'give', 'enough', 'either', 'side', 'file', 'appeal', 'judge', 'made', 'clear', 'see', 'case', 'ending', 'quickly', 'surprised', 'case', 'finds', 'way', 'supremecourt”']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/donald-trump-campaign-trial/index.html,"One of Trump longstanding complaints will become a reality on March 25: His legal peril will force him off the campaign trail – at least during the day. The trial date, set Thursday by a judge in NewYork, is just a week after Trump campaign expects him to reach the delegate threshold to become the presumptive Republican nominee – and roughly seven months before voter will head to ballot box to cast their vote in the 2024 presidential election. While Trump has spent the last year bouncing in and out of court houses in his various legal cases, almost all of these appearances have been voluntary other than his arraignments. The former president often opts to treat the courtroom as a campaign stop, speaking to cameras and ranting against what he has called “political persecution.” Come March, Trump will no longer have a choice – he will be required to sit in the NewYork courtroom four days a week as he faces 34 criminal charges brought by District Attorney Alvin Bragg in an alleged hush-money scheme. The trial is expected to last for roughly six weeks, with court in session every weekday but Wednesdays, severely limiting Trump ability to campaign for president during that time. And the NewYork trial may not be the last that keeps Trump off the campaign trail before the election, with two federal trials still possible this year, along with a case in Georgia that is still pending despite the trouble now facing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. While Trump may effectively bring an end to the GOP nominating fight before the criminal trial begins, the proceedings could disrupt the former president’s pivot to a general election matchup with Biden – dividing his attention between his legal battles and his political campaign. During this primary season, the former president was far outpaced on the trail by his GOP rivals, often choosing to spend time at his Mar-a-Lago home or in a courtroom instead of visiting early voting states. Part of this, his advisers insist, was the enormous lead Trump held over his Republican opponents, a large lead that disappears in a potential rematch against Biden. Trump has painted the cases brought against him as “election interference,” linking the unrelated impending trials as one unfounded conspiracy brought by Democrat and Biden to keep Trump from another term in the White House. Trump attorney Todd Blanche even echoed Trump rhetoric about election interference Thursday as he objected to the start date, but the judge made clear he was not going to delay – not just because of the election but because Trump has another three potential trials still looming in other jurisdictions. ‘Campaigning during the night’ While this rhetoric has served as a rallying cry for Republican in the primary season, Trump team is grappling with how his criminal trials will play in a general election in which the former president will have to court independent voter to claim the White House, multiple people close to the former president told CNN. “The big question mark that remains is, will seeing Trump in court – and the witnesses who will be paraded in – hurt him in the general,” a person close to Trump told CNN. “I think it’ll be less of a problem in the Bragg trial, but it’s still an issue they’ve yet to figure out.” Some of Trump advisers, meanwhile, insist they remain confident that his legal troubles will continue to help his campaign – not just with primary voter, but with general election voter as well. Despite having some concerns immediately following his four indictments that the boost his campaign saw in fundraising in polling would only be short-lived, Trump has continued to enjoy some positive effects from his legal battles. They also point to how many legal experts argue that the criminal hush money case is the weakest and believe having this trial go first will help solidify Trump support with voter who think he is facing what they are argue are too many criminal charges. In private, however, Trump team recognizes that the necessities of court will likely affect the campaign, and provide further ammunition for Biden reelection efforts, people close to Trump said. Trump claimed Thursday that he would still be able to campaign while attending the trial by doing so “in the evening.” “I’ll be here during the day, and I’ll be campaigning during the night,” Trump said, suggesting Biden should do the same. One senior adviser, however, hesitated at that proposal, calling such a schedule “unsustainable” and “exhausting” for the former president. The NewYork criminal trial also presents another problem for Trump ability to create a media circus – cameras are not allowed in the courtroom. Thursday’s hearing likely previewed how the spring months in the courthouse will play out, with Trump finding his way to the camera in the hallway outside before and after the hearing to argue his case in the court of public opinion. ‘He has to be there’ Unlike Trump past visits to courtrooms – most of which were voluntary – the former president’s team anticipates that his attendance will be mandatory at most, if not all, of his trial in Manhattan, his advisers said. “I think he has to be there. It’s a criminal trial, we expect it will be mandatory,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN. At a pretrial hearing Thursday, Judge Juan Merchan said that he expected the trial to go on for six weeks. With Trump sitting at his side looking on, Blanche tried to object to Merchan’s decision to begin the trial on March 25, arguing both that Trump had other three other criminal trials his lawyers had to prepare for and that keeping Trump in the courtroom would impede his presidential campaign. Blanche said that the trial date was “unconstitutional,” pointing to the upcoming GOP primaries. “Trump says it all the time, and the media makes fun of him, but it’s election interference” to make Trump sit here in this courtroom, Blanche argued. But the judge shut down the arguments, saying he’d already heard them and had made his ruling. The judge responded saying Trump would not be required to sit for two criminal trials at the same time. “Certainly, I don’t want to violate his constitutional rights nor does anybody else,” Merchan said. Blanche tried one more time at the very end of the hearing to make his case to the judge – and perhaps to Trump. “We strenuously object to what is happening in this courtroom,” he said. “The fact that Trump is going to now spend the next two months working on this trial instead of out on the campaign trail running for president, is something that should not happen in this country,” he said. “What’s your legal argument?” Merchan asked. “That’s my legal argument,” he responded. “That’s not a legal argument,” Merchan said, ending the hearing and telling the lawyers – and the former president – he’d see them all on March 25. Trump team sees NY case as weakest While neither Trump nor his campaign want to face trial, many allies would rather see the NewYork hush money case go to trial than the other three criminal cases, with a belief that the case from Bragg, a Democrat, is the weakest and easiest to paint as politically motivated. The campaign plans to use the trial to set the stage for its core political argument that these trials are purely political and designed to hurt Trump chances in a general election – an argument it has and will continue to use in all of the former president’s criminal and civil cases. As Trump has demonstrated over the course of his campaign, he sees those fights as part of one larger conflict and has used his court challenges to rally support in the GOP primary. “I think we’ve done a good job of managing the political schedule with the legal schedule,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN. “He’s been able to turn the legal stuff into a political positive.” Trump advisers expect the former president to have enough delegates by March 19, following primary contests in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio, to be considered the presumptive Republican nominee. The general election could pose a different test for Trump, particularly if he is found guilty of a crime. Despite his dominant wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, 31% of Republican caucus-goers and 42% of GOP primary voter in the Granite State said Trump would not be fit for the presidency if convicted of a crime. Those findings underscore the importance of Trump strategy of delaying the criminal cases he is facing for as long as possible. Before Trump entered the courtroom Thursday morning, he stopped at the camera in the hallway outside to speak. The former president complained that he was there – and not in SouthCarolina campaigning. “How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in SouthCarolina right now, where other people are, and where, again – this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said. Of course, Trump did not have to be in the courtroom on Thursday. Merchan waived his appearance at his lawyer’s request for the pretrial hearing – though that was because Trump was considering attending a hearing in Georgia instead, where Willis is facing scrutiny. In six weeks, however, Trump won’t have the same luxury of choosing where he wants to be four days a week","['one', 'trump', 'longstanding', 'complaints', 'become', 'reality', 'march', '25', 'legal',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/robert-hur-hearing-march-12/index.html,"Special counsel Robert Hur is expected to testify at a public hearing in front of the House Judiciary Committee on March 12, sources familiar with the plans told CNN. Hur investigated Biden’s handling of classified documents but ultimately declined to bring criminal charges and said the facts stopped short of finding he willfully retained classified material. But in doing so, Hur offered a deeply damaging portrait of an aging president beset by memory issues, who had trouble recalling dates and details during his five-hour interview with the special counsel. House Republican had reached out to Hur to discuss having him testify in front of the Judiciary Committee about his report, CNN reported earlier this week . House Republican leading the impeachment inquiry into Biden also asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to turn over the transcript of the special counsel’s interview with the president in a new letter on Monday. Republican committee chairs are also asking the Department of Justice to supply Congress with “any recordings, notes, or summaries” of the special counsel’s interview with the president.","['special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'hur', 'expected', 'testify', 'public', 'hearing', 'front', 'house', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'march', '12', 'sources', 'familiar', 'plans', 'hur', 'investigated', 'biden’s', 'handling', 'classified', 'documents', 'ultimately', 'declined', 'bring', 'criminal', 'charges', 'facts', 'stopped', 'short', 'finding', 'willfully', 'retained', 'classified', 'material', 'hur', 'offered', 'deeply', 'damaging', 'portrait', 'aging', 'president', 'beset', 'memory', 'issues', 'trouble', 'recalling', 'dates', 'details', 'fivehour', 'interview', 'special', 'counsel', 'house', 'republican', 'reached', 'hur', 'discuss', 'testify', 'front', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'report', 'reported', 'earlier', 'week', 'house', 'republican', 'leading', 'impeachment', 'inquiry', 'biden', 'asked', 'attorney', 'general', 'merrick', 'garland', 'turn', 'transcript', 'special', 'counsel’s', 'interview', 'president', 'new', 'letter', 'monday', 'republican', 'committee', 'chairs', 'asking', 'department', 'justice', 'supply', 'congress', '“any', 'recordings', 'notes', 'summaries”', 'special', 'counsel’s', 'interview', 'president']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/blinken-americans-west-bank-investigation/index.html,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday offered his “deepest condolences” to the families of two Palestinian-American teenagers “who reportedly were killed” in the West Bank and said that there must be an investigation into their deaths. “We’ve made clear that with regard to the incidents you’ve alluded to, there needs to be an investigation. We need to get the facts. And if appropriate, there needs to be accountability,” Blinken said at a press conference in Albania in response to a question from CNN’s Alex Marquardt. Two 17-year-old Palestinian-Americans were reportedly killed in the West Bank by Israeli forces in less than a month. 17-year-old Mohammad Ahmed Mohammad Khdour was shot in the head by Israeli forces on Saturday while traveling by car in the town of Biddu, according to the organization “Defense for Children – Palestine.” CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces about the reported shooting. The US Office of Palestinian Affairs said in a post on X that it was “devastated by the killing.” Last month, another American, 17-year-old Tawfic Abdel, was fatally shot in the head, according to Palestinian news agency WAFA. The IDF and Israeli police told CNN that they had opened an investigation into the incident. A number of American citizens have also been detained by Israeli forces in recent weeks. Blinken would not give details on their cases, citing privacy laws. “I can just say in general, without reference to specific cases, we insist that people be treated fairly, that they be treated with due process, and that they be treated humanely,” he said. “That’s something that, regardless of where an American citizen might be detained, we insist on. And we’ll continue to insist on.” Two Americans, Hashem Alagha, 20, and Borak Alagha, 18, were detained by Israeli forces during a raid of a home in Gaza last week, according to a family member in the United States. An American woman, Samaher Esmail , was taken from her home in the West Bank and detained more than a week ago by Israeli forces. Her family alleges that she was beaten and denied medication in custody. A spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service told CNN that she is “being held in accordance with the law” and “given medical treatment for medical problems that arose even before her arrest.” In a statement to CNN Tuesday, the IDF said Esmail was arrested during “a battalion operation that took place in the area of the village of Silwad to arrest terror suspects” on February 5. “All those arrested in the operation were transferred to the security forces for further treatment,” the IDF said. The IDF did not address the family’s claims about Esmail’s mistreatment in custody and referred further questions to the Israel Prison Service, to whom CNN has reached out. The IDF response also did not provide further details about the alleged “incitement on social media.” According to the family, Esmail was detained because of “10-year-old Facebook posts and political cartoons she shared.” Posts from Esmail’s Facebook seen by CNN show cartoons favorably depicting Hamas and two photos of her holding a gun. Family spokesperson Jonathan Franks said the gun is in Louisiana, where Esmail also resides and legally owns the firearm. “Ms. Esmail’s opinions may be disfavored in Israel proper, but the inescapable reality is they were protected speech which no rational person could consider an incitement to violence,” the statement released by Franks on behalf of the family said.","['us', 'secretary', 'state', 'antony', 'blinken', 'thursday', 'offered', '“deepest', 'condolences”', 'families', 'two', 'palestinianamerican', 'teenagers', '“who', 'reportedly', 'killed”', 'west', 'bank', 'must', 'investigation', 'deaths', '“we’ve', 'made', 'clear', 'regard', 'incidents', 'you’ve', 'alluded', 'needs', 'investigation', 'need', 'facts', 'appropriate', 'needs', 'accountability”', 'blinken', 'press', 'conference', 'albania', 'response', 'question', 'cnn’s', 'alex', 'marquardt', 'two', '17yearold', 'palestinianamericans', 'reportedly', 'killed', 'west', 'bank', 'israeli', 'forces', 'less', 'month', '17yearold', 'mohammad', 'ahmed', 'mohammad', 'khdour', 'shot', 'head', 'israeli', 'forces', 'saturday', 'traveling', 'car', 'town', 'biddu', 'according', 'organization', '“defense', 'children', 'palestine”', 'reached', 'israel', 'defense', 'forces', 'reported', 'shooting', 'us', 'office', 'palestinian', 'affairs', 'post', 'x', '“devastated', 'killing”', 'last', 'month', 'another', 'american', '17yearold', 'tawfic', 'abdel', 'fatally', 'shot', 'head', 'according', 'palestinian', 'agency', 'wafa', 'idf', 'israeli', 'police', 'opened', 'investigation', 'incident', 'number', 'american', 'citizens', 'detained', 'israeli', 'forces', 'recent', 'weeks', 'blinken', 'give', 'details', 'cases', 'citing', 'privacy', 'laws', 'say', 'general', 'without', 'reference', 'specific', 'cases', 'insist', 'people', 'treated', 'fairly', 'treated', 'due', 'process', 'treated', 'humanely”', '“that’s', 'something', 'regardless', 'american', 'citizen', 'might', 'detained', 'insist', 'we’ll', 'continue', 'insist', 'on”', 'two', 'americans', 'hashem', 'alagha', '20', 'borak', 'alagha', '18', 'detained', 'israeli', 'forces', 'raid', 'home', 'gaza', 'last', 'week', 'according', 'family', 'member', 'united', 'states', 'american', 'woman', 'samaher', 'esmail', 'taken', 'home', 'west', 'bank', 'detained', 'week', 'ago', 'israeli', 'forces', 'family', 'alleges', 'beaten', 'denied', 'medication', 'custody', 'spokesperson', 'israel', 'prison', 'service', '“being', 'held', 'accordance', 'law”', '“given', 'medical', 'treatment', 'medical', 'problems', 'arose', 'arrest”', 'statement', 'tuesday', 'idf', 'esmail', 'arrested', '“a', 'battalion', 'operation', 'took', 'place', 'area', 'village', 'silwad', 'arrest', 'terror', 'suspects”', 'february', '5', '“all', 'arrested', 'operation', 'transferred', 'security', 'forces', 'treatment”', 'idf', 'idf', 'address', 'family’s', 'claims', 'esmail’s', 'mistreatment', 'custody', 'referred', 'questions', 'israel', 'prison', 'service', 'reached', 'idf', 'response', 'provide', 'details', 'alleged', '“incitement', 'social', 'media”', 'according', 'family', 'esmail', 'detained', '“10yearold', 'facebook', 'posts', 'political', 'cartoons', 'shared”', 'posts', 'esmail’s', 'facebook', 'seen', 'show', 'cartoons', 'favorably', 'depicting', 'hamas', 'two', 'photos', 'holding', 'gun', 'family', 'spokesperson', 'jonathan', 'franks', 'gun', 'louisiana', 'esmail', 'resides', 'legally', 'owns', 'firearm', '“ms', 'esmail’s', 'opinions', 'may', 'disfavored', 'israel', 'proper', 'inescapable', 'reality', 'protected', 'speech', 'rational', 'person', 'consider', 'incitement', 'violence”', 'statement', 'released', 'franks', 'behalf', 'family']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/nikki-haley-secret-service-protection/index.html,"A congressional advisory committee has voted in favor of granting Nikki Haley US Secret Service protection, according to a source familiar with the matter, after the GOP presidential candidate requested the enhanced security citing threats she is facing. The recommendation now heads to the desk of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , who will make the final decision based on multiple factors, the source said. Mayorkas, who earlier this week became the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in 150 years, is currently traveling in Germany for the Munich Security Conference. The protective detail is expected to be approved and Haley would get a protective detail as soon as next week, a second source familiar with the matter told CNN. The Secret Service has multiple protection teams ready to be dispatched, and one of those teams would be sent to protect the former SouthCarolina governor on the same day that it is authorized to do so, the first source said. The congressional advisory committee that makes the determination whether it believes a presidential candidate should qualify for protection includes the House speaker, House minority whip, Senate majority and minority leaders, and one additional member chosen by the panel. But the advisory committee’s finding is only one of multiple factors that Mayorkas will consider when making the final decision on granting the Secret Service protection to Haley. The other factors include, but are not limited to: an assessment conducted by the Secret Service of threats directed toward the candidate; whether the candidate is polling nationally at 15% or more for 30 consecutive days; and whether the candidate is the formal or de facto nominee of a major party for president or vice president. Haley is currently the last remaining major challenger to former Trump in the Republican primary. Her campaign requested Secret Service protection earlier this month over threats faced by the candidate. There were reports of two swatting incidents in recent months at Haley’s home in SouthCarolina, one of which occurred while her parents were there. Haley’s campaign and the Department of Homeland Security did not comment on the matter","['congressional', 'advisory', 'committee', 'voted', 'favor', 'granting', 'nikki', 'haley', 'us', 'secret', 'service', 'protection', 'according', 'source', 'familiar', 'matter', 'gop', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'requested', 'enhanced', 'security', 'citing', 'threats', 'facing', 'recommendation', 'heads', 'desk', 'homeland', 'security', 'secretary', 'alejandro', 'mayorkas', 'make', 'final', 'decision', 'based', 'multiple', 'factors', 'source', 'mayorkas', 'earlier', 'week', 'became', 'first', 'cabinet', 'secretary', 'impeached', '150', 'years', 'currently', 'traveling', 'germany', 'munich', 'security', 'conference', 'protective', 'detail', 'expected', 'approved', 'haley', 'protective', 'detail', 'soon', 'next', 'week', 'second', 'source', 'familiar', 'matter', 'secret', 'service', 'multiple', 'protection', 'teams', 'ready', 'dispatched', 'one', 'teams', 'sent', 'protect', 'southcarolina', 'governor', 'day', 'authorized', 'first', 'source', 'congressional', 'advisory', 'committee', 'makes', 'determination', 'whether', 'believes', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'qualify', 'protection', 'includes', 'house', 'speaker', 'house', 'minority', 'whip', 'senate', 'majority', 'minority', 'leaders', 'one', 'additional', 'member', 'chosen', 'panel', 'advisory', 'committee’s', 'finding', 'one', 'multiple', 'factors', 'mayorkas', 'consider', 'making', 'final', 'decision', 'granting', 'secret', 'service', 'protection', 'haley', 'factors', 'include', 'limited', 'assessment', 'conducted', 'secret', 'service', 'threats', 'directed', 'toward', 'candidate', 'whether', 'candidate', 'polling', 'nationally', '15', '30', 'consecutive', 'days', 'whether', 'candidate', 'formal', 'de', 'facto', 'nominee', 'major', 'president', 'vice', 'president', 'haley', 'currently', 'last', 'remaining', 'major', 'challenger', 'trump', 'republican', 'primary', 'campaign', 'requested', 'secret', 'service', 'protection', 'earlier', 'month', 'threats', 'faced', 'candidate', 'reports', 'two', 'swatting', 'incidents', 'recent', 'months', 'haley’s', 'home', 'southcarolina', 'one', 'occurred', 'parents', 'haley’s', 'campaign', 'department', 'homeland', 'security', 'comment', 'matter']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/georgia-trump-hearing/index.html,"A hearing that could derail the election subversion case against Trump and others in Georgia is underway as a judge considers whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified. The two-day evidentiary hearing is a pivotal moment for the Georgia RICO case. Trump and co-defendants are seeking to remove Willis based on allegations that she and Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to lead the case, engaged in an improper romantic relationship which financially benefitted the district attorney. If Trump and his co-defendants succeed in disqualifying Willis, some inside the DA’s office fear it could derail the entire case, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking. The sprawling racketeering case still has no trial date, and Willis and her team are keenly aware that the window to go to trial before the 2024 election is rapidly shrinking. Any delay could mean Trump could avoid a trial on his efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat or connections to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack until after Election Day. Trump federal trial is already delayed due to a request for the SupremeCourt to intervene. It’s unclear if another prosecutor in Georgia would even be inclined to take up the case from Willis, given its political and legal challenges. Wade and Willis acknowledged in court filings that they had a personal relationship but deny any wrongdoing. Willis argued there’s no basis for her to be disqualified or for the case to be dismissed. During a hearing earlier this week, Willis’s attorneys failed to convince Judge Scott McAfee that the motions to disqualify her and dismiss the case should be denied without an evidentiary hearing. McAfee called for the hearing Thursday to “establish the record on those core allegations” against Willis and Wade and their relationship. “That is no longer a matter of complete speculation. The state has admitted a relationship existed,” McAfee said Monday. “So what remains to be proven is the existence and extent of any financial benefit, again if there even was one. Because I think it’s possible that the facts alleged by the defendant could result in disqualification.” If Willis survives the challenge, the DA’s office believes it has an opportunity to hit the reset button on the case and turn its focus back to preparing for trial, which prosecutors hope to begin in August. Willis and Wade are among those expected to testify. Others who could be called to testify include two top DA attorneys, Wade, members of Willis’s personal security team and Willis’s father. Allegations against Wade and Willis The alleged affair was first raised by Trump co-defendant, former 2020 campaign official Mike Roman, last month in a court filing accusing Willis of financially benefiting from selecting Wade when he took her on lavish vacations, paid partly with what he billed her office for work on the case. Willis appointed Wade special prosecutor to assist in the investigation in 2021. But there was little direct evidence included in that initial filing seeking her dismissal and for the case to be tossed, an effort Trump has since joined. Since then, credit card statements revealed in Wade’s divorce case show he paid for two plane tickets for Willis to San Francisco and Miami. Trump and the 14 remaining co-defendants were indicted by Willis last summer and have pleaded not guilty. Four other co-defendants have already pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors to testify. Roman’s attorney Ashleigh Merchant told CNN she plans to call Wade as the first witness. “We are focusing on what the judge asked us to show him – the personal and financial benefits that Willis got from Wade,” Merchant told CNN. “The money trail, history of lies.” A ‘star witness’ and nearly a dozen subpoenas Merchant has subpoenaed nearly a dozen others to testify during Thursday’s hearing, including DA employees and Willis herself. McAfee said that he will allow Merchant – who represents Roman – to question her “star” witness and Wade’s former law partner, Terrence Bradley, on Thursday. Bradley also represented Wade during his divorce proceedings, which also highlighted Wade and Willis’s relationship. In previous court filings, Merchant has said Bradley’s testimony will refute the claim from Willis and Wade that their personal relationship began after she appointed him in late 2021 to lead the case against Trump and his allies. In an affidavit submitted to the court earlier this month, Wade wrote that he has “never cohabited” with Willis. Merchant contends that Bradley would dispute that assertion. “Bradley will confirm that Willis and Wade stayed together,” Merchant said in a court filing that referred to them staying together beginning in the fall of 2022 in a “safehouse” that Fulton County rented for Willis. What if Willis is disqualified? If McAfee decides to grant the co-defendants’ motions and remove Willis from prosecuting the sprawling RICO case, under Georgia law the case would automatically be re-assigned to the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, a bipartisan collaboration of six district attorneys and three solicitors general from across the state. The council’s executive director, Peter Skandalakis, would be responsible for either appointing a new district attorney from a separate county to oversee the case or a private lawyer, attorney general, or one of the members of the council. “It’s a historic indictment, it’s a historic event, and you have to find somebody with the resources and experience that is capable of handling this type of case,” Skandalakis told CNN, adding that in this scenario, he would appoint a candidate that actually wanted the high-profile case. “This case has a lot of people emotionally tied to it and that does make things a little bit more complex because there is the security issue that always goes along with a case of this magnitude that has this much attention,” he said. Could Wade leave the case voluntarily? While CNN has reported that Willis has no plans to voluntarily recuse herself from the Georgia RICO case, sources were less definitive when asked about Wade’s future. Some legal experts have called for Wade to step aside on his own even if the allegations against him and Willis do not meet the legal threshold for disqualification. “I think it is the wise thing to do, but it is not legally required for him to step aside,” Norm Eisen, who served as White House ethics czar during the Obama administration and is a CNN legal analyst, told reporters last month. Eisen added the allegations do not concern him with regard to Willis’ ability to try the case. Wade’s immediate future remains unclear. Sources said there are no immediate plans for him to step down but if he did, Willis could replace him with another lead prosecutor or lean on her experienced staff in order to avoid a delay.","['hearing', 'derail', 'election', 'subversion', 'case', 'trump', 'others', 'georgia', 'underway', 'judge', 'considers', 'whether', 'fulton', 'county', 'district', 'attorney', 'fani',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/us-allies-disrupt-russian-hacking/index.html,"The FBI and its international allies disrupted a network of over 1,000 hacked internet routers that Russia’s military intelligence agency was using for cyber espionage operations against the United States and its European allies, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday. The law enforcement operation used a court order to cut off access to the home and small-business routers hacked by the Russian GRU military intelligence agency, kicking them out and “lock[ing] the door behind them,” Wray said at the Munich Security Conference. The Russian hackers were using the network of hacked routers, which is known as a botnet, to target US and foreign governments, and “military, security and corporate organizations” for intelligence gathering, the Justice Department announced . The Russian Embassy in Washington, DC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wray’s allegations. Wray also used his podium in Munich — where intelligence officials from around the world gather every year — to reiterate US warnings that Russia and China-backed hacking teams have long sought a foothold in US energy and telecommunications networks. US officials worry that Beijing could use that access to take networks offline in the event of a crisis. Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, “we’ve seen Russia conducting reconnaissance on the US energy sector,” Wray said. “And that’s a particularly worrisome trend because we know that once access is established, the hacker can switch from information gathering to attack quickly and without notice.” The disclosure of the FBI operation comes as US officials and lawmakers grapple with another more concerning Russian capability. The US has new intelligence on Russian military capabilities related to its efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space, CNN reported Wednesday. “Russia has made murder, rape and mayhem its stock and trade, so no one should question its continued willingness to launch destructive cyberattacks before and during military conflict,” the FBI chief added. Wray delivered a stark warning to US lawmakers last month that Chinese hackers were preparing to “wreak havoc” on US critical infrastructure in the event of a crisis. In Munich on Thursday, Wray said that Beijing’s hackers had been “prepositioning” in US oil and natural gas company networks since 2011, “but these days it’s [reached] something closer to a fever pitch.” “What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing buildout of offensive [cyber] weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.” The Chinese government routinely denies those allegations and in turn accuses the US of conducting hacking operations against China. Wray’s announcement is the latest move by the FBI to use court orders to try to stifle complex hacking operations from Russian spy agencies. Weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the FBI went public with a similar operation to neutralize another botnet allegedly controlled by a different GRU hacking team that comprised thousands of infected hardware devices. US intelligence agencies also use hacking operations to try to thwart Russia, China and other rival governments. But unlike the FBI’s court-authorized work, details of those US cyber operations rarely, if ever, are made public.","['fbi', 'international', 'allies', 'disrupted', 'network', '1000', 'hacked', 'internet', 'routers', 'russia’s', 'military', 'intelligence', 'agency', 'using', 'cyber', 'espionage', 'operations', 'united', 'states', 'european', 'allies', 'fbi', 'director', 'christopher', 'wray', 'thursday', 'law', 'enforcement', 'operation', 'used', 'court', 'order', 'cut', 'access', 'home', 'smallbusiness', 'routers', 'hacked', 'russian', 'gru', 'military', 'intelligence', 'agency', 'kicking', '“locking', 'door', 'behind', 'them”', 'wray', 'munich', 'security', 'conference', 'russian', 'hackers', 'using', 'network', 'hacked', 'routers', 'known', 'botnet', 'target', 'us', 'foreign', 'governments', '“military', 'security', 'corporate', 'organizations”', 'intelligence', 'gathering', 'justice', 'department', 'announced', 'russian', 'embassy', 'washington', 'dc', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'wray’s', 'allegations', 'wray', 'used', 'podium', 'munich', 'intelligence', 'officials', 'around', 'world', 'gather', 'every', 'year', 'reiterate', 'us', 'warnings', 'russia', 'chinabacked', 'hacking', 'teams', 'long', 'sought', 'foothold', 'us', 'energy', 'telecommunications', 'networks', 'us', 'officials', 'worry', 'beijing', 'use', 'access', 'take', 'networks', 'offline', 'event', 'crisis', 'following', 'russia’s', 'fullscale', 'invasion', 'ukraine', 'two', 'years', 'ago', '“we’ve', 'seen', 'russia', 'conducting', 'reconnaissance', 'us', 'energy', 'sector”', 'wray', '“and', 'that’s', 'particularly', 'worrisome', 'trend', 'know', 'access', 'established', 'hacker', 'switch', 'information', 'gathering', 'attack', 'quickly', 'without', 'notice”', 'disclosure', 'fbi', 'operation', 'comes', 'us', 'officials', 'lawmakers', 'grapple', 'another', 'concerning', 'russian', 'capability', 'us', 'new', 'intelligence', 'russian', 'military', 'capabilities', 'related', 'efforts', 'deploy', 'nuclear', 'antisatellite', 'system', 'space', 'reported', 'wednesday', '“russia', 'made', 'murder', 'rape', 'mayhem', 'stock', 'trade', 'one', 'question', 'continued', 'willingness', 'launch', 'destructive', 'cyberattacks', 'military', 'conflict”', 'fbi', 'chief', 'added', 'wray', 'delivered', 'stark', 'warning', 'us', 'lawmakers', 'last', 'month', 'chinese', 'hackers', 'preparing', '“wreak', 'havoc”', 'us', 'critical', 'infrastructure', 'event', 'crisis', 'munich', 'thursday', 'wray', 'beijing’s', 'hackers', '“prepositioning”', 'us', 'oil', 'natural', 'gas', 'company', 'networks', 'since', '2011', '“but', 'days', 'reached', 'something', 'closer', 'fever', 'pitch”', '“what', 'we’re', 'seeing', 'china’s', 'increasing', 'buildout', 'offensive', 'cyber', 'weapons', 'within', 'critical', 'infrastructure', 'poised', 'attack', 'whenever', 'beijing', 'decides', 'right”', 'chinese', 'government', 'routinely', 'denies', 'allegations', 'turn', 'accuses', 'us', 'conducting', 'hacking', 'operations', 'china', 'wray’s', 'announcement', 'latest', 'move', 'fbi', 'use', 'court', 'orders', 'try', 'stifle', 'complex', 'hacking', 'operations', 'russian', 'spy', 'agencies', 'weeks', 'russia’s', 'fullscale', 'invasion', 'ukraine', '2022', 'fbi', 'went', 'public', 'similar', 'operation', 'neutralize', 'another', 'botnet', 'allegedly', 'controlled', 'different', 'gru', 'hacking', 'team', 'comprised', 'thousands', 'infected', 'hardware', 'devices', 'us', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'use', 'hacking', 'operations', 'try', 'thwart', 'russia', 'china', 'rival', 'governments', 'unlike', 'fbi’s', 'courtauthorized', 'work', 'details', 'us', 'cyber', 'operations', 'rarely', 'ever', 'made', 'public']"

But in an interview with CNN in his Senate office on Wednesday, McConnell called this battle over Ukraine aid a “rare issue” where he had to get well out front of his party, which has grown increasingly resistant to helping fund the foreign war amid the ascendant isolationist wing being driven by Trump. “It’s not a question of whether I’m frustrated or not,” McConnell said when asked about the criticism he’s endured from within his own party. “I feel strongly this is in our best interest, America’s best interest and the world’s best interests to do this. … And being beat up is something I’m kind of used to after 18 years.” Over the last few weeks, McConnell blessed a bipartisan border security deal that he tried to sell to GOP senators – only to see it derailed by House Republican leaders, fellow senators and Trump himself. Then, he helped push through the Senate a $95.3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan – only to find himself in the minority of his conference when 22 of the 49 GOP senators voted to approve the plan earlier this week. Now, House Speaker Mike Johnson is threatening to shelve the bill altogether – all with Trump backing. The US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024.

Every single one of them,” McConnell said of providing billions more to Ukraine. “Most of the money’s being spent here. Europeans have done as much, and, after the $55 billion from the EU, more than we have. Not a single American soldier has lost their lives in this fight – we’ve got a bunch of people willing to kill Russians. I can’t find any argument against this that makes any sense.” McConnell added: “So I think it’s a political reaction led, obviously, by the likely nominee for president having a view and expressing a view on this. So I think that’s why we are where we are.” Senate GOP leader’s suggestion: A House vote on aid bill McConnell’s comments come as Johnson said on Wednesday that the House would not take up the aid package, with many in his party arguing it’s time to stop pouring money into Ukraine and calling for more aggressive border security measures than the package proposed by the bipartisan group of senators and blessed by the Senate GOP leader. “The Republican-led House will not be jammed or forced into passing a foreign aid bill that was opposed by most Republican senators and does nothing to secure own border,” Johnson said Wednesday. McConnell said he wouldn’t comment on Johnson’s assertion. But he suggested that the Senate bill should get a vote on the House floor. “Whatever advice I have for the speaker I give him privately, not publicly,” McConnell said. “The only thing I’ve said publicly is we’ve heard all kinds of rumors about what the vote would be on Ukraine. Why not have it?” In the interview, McConnell downplayed the influence of the isolationist wing of his party, arguing that Republican views about the US posture in the world have long been driven by their party’s presidential candidate – something not unusual now given Trump positions. “Having lived as long as I have, I’ve kind of observed the party go up-and-down on foreign involvements, depending usually on who the president is, or the nominee for president, having the biggest impact on public opinion,” McConnell said. McConnell, who turns 82 next week, has not said if he would run for the GOP leadership spot after his current term concludes at the end of the year. That position could grow more complicated for the Kentucky Republican if Trump wins the presidency, given the two haven’t spoken in more than three years and they had a major falling out after the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack. McConnell non-committal on Mayorkas trial and touts Senate border deal Adding to the challenges of governing under Trump: The former president has tried to scuttle the remaining big-ticket items that McConnell has tried to approve, including on border security. Meantime, the House GOP has aligned itself closely with Trump and taken steps that have made some Republican senators uneasy – including impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the problems at the border. McConnell said he hadn’t taken a position yet on the Mayorkas trial and whether he would vote to dismiss the charges. “I haven’t really thought about it,” McConnell said, noting that Democrat would move to quickly kill the proceedings. “So I don’t think we’ll have two endless trials like we’ve had recently.” In the interview, McConnell defended his handling of the push to get a border deal, noting that Republican had demanded one before green-lighting more Ukraine aid. And he continued to tout the border deal even though it has been heavily criticized by many in his party and ultimately collapsed. “So I picked James Lankford, who’s really smart, and, as you know, they worked on it for months, came up with a product supported by the border council, the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the Washington Post editorial page,” McConnell said, calling the plan “clearly an improvement over existing law.” After Republican said they wouldn’t support the border deal, McConnell said he “felt strongly” to move on the rest of the aid package without the immigration measures given the situation in Ukraine. Democrat have seized on the GOP decision to scuttle the border deal – something Democrat Tom Suozzi used i n his successful run in the NewYork special election for a US House seat on Tuesday night. But McConnell didn’t think the flap would have much of an impact on Senate races . “ I think that every one of these races will hash that out one way or another,” McConnell said. “Obviously up in NewYork, the Democrat did a better job of dealing with it than the Republican, and I think that’ll play out depending upon the quality of the candidates.” And he pivoted to the Senate GOP push to take back the majority: “I think we’re not going to have a candidate quality problem this cycle on our side .” On the border, McConnell added: “ I think Biden has a real problem on this issue with or without a new law.” But unlike his House GOP counterparts, McConnell did not take aim at Biden memory or mental acuity after concerns were raised by Special Counsel Robert Hur’s damning report last week about his handling of classified records. “The age issue is obviously front and center for both candidates,” McConnell said when asked about the matter","['senate', 'gop', 'leader', 'mitch',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/pete-hoekstra-michigan-rnc/index.html,"The Republican National Committee, along with former Trump , on Wednesday moved to end the ongoing dispute over who is the leader of the Michigan Republican Party . A panel within the Republican National Committee voted unanimously to recognize Pete Hoekstra, a former ambassador and congressman, as chair. “The committee on contests ruled that it is their belief that Karamo was removed as chair and it was recommended to the RNC executive committee to ratify Hoekstra as chair,” the RNC said in a readout. “The Executive Committee took action today to unanimously ratify Hoekstra as an RNC member as chair.” Shortly after, Trump, who had thrown his support behind Hoekstra last month, reiterated his stance. “I look forward to working with Ambassador Pete Hoekstra as Chairman of the Republican Party of Michigan,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “He is a winner who was a GREAT Congressman from Michigan and, likewise, did a fantastic job as Ambassador to the Netherlands. Pete will make The Republican Party of Michigan GREAT AGAIN, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be its Chairman —HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” Trump statement and the RNC ruling, together, were the strongest signs that the two most influential entities in Republican committee politics had thrown their full support behind Hoekstra and against Kristina Karamo, the embattled Michigan chairwoman who state Republican voted to oust in January. Karamo had defied that vote and argued that it was illegitimate. Her refusal to step down left the state party in gridlock throughout much of January and during the RNC winter meeting in Las Vegas. She and Hoekstra both attended, but neither were credentialed as full voting members at the event. “Both the RNC and our Party’s presumptive nominee Trump, have now both come forward and recognized me as the duly elected Chair of the Michigan Republican Party,” Hoekstra said in a statement. “It is time for the former Chair who was properly removed in accordance with the MIGOP bylaws to end her misinformation campaign and join the fight to re-elect Trump rather than dividing this Party.” Karamo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","['republican', 'national', 'committee', 'along', 'trump', 'wednesday', 'moved', 'end', 'ongoing', 'dispute', 'leader', 'michigan', 'republican', 'panel', 'within', 'republican', 'national', 'committee', 'voted', 'unanimously', 'recognize', 'pete', 'hoekstra', 'ambassador', 'congressman', 'chair', '“the', 'committee', 'contests', 'ruled', 'belief', 'karamo', 'removed', 'chair', 'recommended', 'rnc', 'executive', 'committee', 'ratify', 'hoekstra', 'chair”', 'rnc', 'readout', '“the', 'executive', 'committee', 'took', 'action', 'today', 'unanimously', 'ratify', 'hoekstra', 'rnc', 'member', 'chair”', 'shortly', 'trump', 'thrown', 'support', 'behind', 'hoekstra', 'last', 'month', 'reiterated', 'stance', 'look', 'forward', 'working', 'ambassador', 'pete', 'hoekstra', 'chairman', 'republican', 'michigan”', 'trump', 'wrote', 'truth', 'social', '“he', 'winner', 'great', 'congressman', 'michigan', 'likewise', 'fantastic', 'job', 'ambassador', 'netherlands', 'pete', 'make', 'republican', 'michigan', 'great', 'complete', 'total', 'endorsement', 'chairman', '—he', 'never', 'let', 'down”', 'trump', 'statement', 'rnc', 'ruling', 'together', 'strongest', 'signs', 'two', 'influential', 'entities', 'republican', 'committee', 'politics', 'thrown', 'full', 'support', 'behind', 'hoekstra', 'kristina', 'karamo', 'embattled', 'michigan', 'chairwoman', 'state', 'republican', 'voted', 'oust', 'january', 'karamo', 'defied', 'vote', 'argued', 'illegitimate', 'refusal', 'step', 'left', 'state', 'gridlock', 'throughout', 'much', 'january', 'rnc', 'winter', 'meeting', 'las', 'vegas', 'hoekstra', 'attended', 'neither', 'credentialed', 'full', 'voting', 'members', 'event', '“both', 'rnc', 'party’s', 'presumptive', 'nominee', 'trump', 'come', 'forward', 'recognized', 'duly', 'elected', 'chair', 'michigan', 'republican', 'party”', 'hoekstra', 'statement', '“it', 'chair', 'properly', 'removed', 'accordance', 'migop', 'bylaws', 'end', 'misinformation', 'campaign', 'join', 'fight', 'reelect', 'trump', 'rather', 'dividing', 'party”', 'karamo', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'comment']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/new-york-special-election-takeaways/index.html,"Democrat Tom Suozzi is heading back to Congress after defeating Republican Mazi Pilip in the special election to replace serial fabulist and expelled former GOP Rep. George Santos . The result will further narrow the GOP’s already thin House majority and hand Biden’s party a boost as the general election campaign comes into focus. Suozzi’s success provides Biden and national Democrat with a much-needed narrative reshuffle – a bit of good news during a period when concerns over the president’s paltry poll numbers and intensifying worries over his age, or how it’s perceived by the electorate, has stoked anxieties about the likely coming rematch with former Trump . Yes, the district broke cleanly for Biden in 2020, but Democrat on Long Island had been losing there ever since – until Tuesday. Both parties poured cash into the race for NewYork’s 3rd congressional district, but Democrat’ fundraising and registration advantage combined with Suozzi’s brand – he’s spent most of the last 30 years at or around the center of Long Island politics – and a fired-up base, angry over the Santos fiasco, delivered a victory that means the House GOP will now become even harder to corral. For Pilip, who has vowed to run again in the fall, defeat meant an almost immediate rebuke from Trump, who called her a “very foolish woman” in a social media post Tuesday night. Pilip refused until the final days of the campaign to say whether she voted for Trump in 2020, though she did follow his lead in dissing a highly touted bipartisan Senate border bill – a decision that helped Suozzi tie her more tightly to the former president over the last week. Video Ad Feedback Hear why Trump didn't endorse the Republican candidate to replace Santos 01:04 - Source: CNN As Democrat celebrate and Republican dust themselves off, here are the takeaways: Immigration is a big issue – but is it a game-changer? The campaign was staked on a series of issues from the beginning: immigration, inflation, Israel and abortion. Suozzi talked about reproductive rights but didn’t make it a centerpiece of his campaign. Inflation has mostly leveled out. And there was no political or policy space to speak of between the candidates who both fully backed Israel. Understanding this, Pilip and Republican set about hammering Suozzi over the migrant crisis in NewYork City, claiming he caused it along with Biden – a line that ultimately didn’t quite wash with voter who have long recognized Suozzi as a moderate or centrist. When Pilip suggested he was in league with the progressive “squad,” Suozzi at their debate was prepared. “For you to suggest I’m a member of the squad,” he said, “is about as believable as you being a member of George Santos’s volleyball team.” Most notably, though, Suozzi and state Democrat leaders didn’t repeat their mistakes from 2022. They aggressively countered Pilip’s migrant message and it never felt like the issue, typically a winner for the GOP, put Suozzi on the backfoot. Redemption for top NewYork Democrat Suozzi’s win is also a major coup for the NewYork Democrat Party and its leaders, who came under heavy criticism from within over its candidates’ underwhelming performances in the 2022 midterms. Backed by lots of outside cash, new grassroots organizations, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his political operation, along with top state and local Democrat – Gov. Kathy Hochul and state party chair Jay Jacobs, specifically – the party simply could not allow the seat to slip away again. Not after the Santos mess, not with the entire country watching and the White House desperate for a win. Victory has a hundred fathers, and they all did some well-deserved peacocking on Tuesday night. If not redemption, the NewYork Democrat Party in this special election earned a reprieve. Whether it can translate what worked – with different, perhaps weaker candidates – in the fall remains to be seen. But there’s no debating, after this result, that they’ll be given every opportunity. The weather mattered Though not for exactly the reasons one might immediately expect. It snowed heavily in the tri-state area for the first time in years Tuesday, which made travel tricky, closed schools and otherwise disrupted the normal flow of an election day. Good thing then for Democrat that, unlike many Republican in thrall to Trump, they very much embrace the idea of early voting. As the storm swept through Queens and Long Island on Tuesday, Republican groups and the Pilip campaign scrambled to drive – literally in some cases – their voter to the polls. The top GOP House super PAC made hay on social media over spending a relative pittance on plows to clear roads in Republican-friendly areas. But if the snow didn’t really stick, it appears GOP rank-and-file distaste for banking vote early did. As yet unknown statistics will provide a clearer picture of what went wrong for Pilip, but the weather definitely clouded the picture. Democrat have an Israel problem There stood Suozzi, all smiles, as he prepared to begin his victory speech, when he was interrupted by protesters accusing him of aiding and abetting a “genocide” by Israel in Gaza. Then it happened again. And again. Nevermind his rival was arguably more inclined to support Israel – she was a member of the Israel Defense Forces before moving to the US, after all – in its deadly monthslong military campaign. The interruptions were as much a message to Democrat, especially Biden, as the once and now future congressman from a heavily Jewish district. Though little will be made of a brief demonstration before a speech, the anger among progressive grassroots – young voter even more so – is real, and it is not going away. It might not add up to more vote for Republican in the fall, but as things stand, it seems sure to eat away at Democrat support. And in an era of fine political margins, that’s a problem. Don’t take away too much This race was always going to take on national significance, both because of the stakes in the House and the makeup of the electorate, which is largely similar to suburban swing districts in presidential battleground states. But Democrat would be wise to remember that Suozzi was a unique – and uniquely talented – candidate with deep ties across Nassau County, where most of the voter reside. A former mayor, he became the first Democrat elected to the county’s top job in more than three decades when he won it in 2002. After losing his bid for a third term and some time away, he returned to become a congressman – winning the seat three times, including a defeat of Santos in 2020, before leaving for a failed gubernatorial bid in 2022. Simply stated, Suozzi had a record, and for all the ads launched against him, voter in the district knew who he was – a moderate who courts labor and will aggressively push for the return of the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, that just about everyone on Long Island wants back after Republican jettisoned it as part of their 2017 tax cuts. It also remains to be seen how exactly the district-wide vote broke down. Suozzi appears to have exceeded expectations in Queens – a diverse borough of NewYork City and not a suburb – which could yet mean the town helped him as much as the country. Pilip, on the other hand, was a relative unknown going into the race and a relative unknown coming out of it. A county legislator, she made precious few public appearances, held a handful of notable events outside the district, and seemed unsure of how to position herself in relation to Trump.","['democrat',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-fani-willis-assistant-confirms-romantic-relationship-with-nathan-wade-in-2019,"Fani Willis judge is frustrated with witness gamesmanship: Matthew Whitaker Former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker reacts to Fani Willis' 'stunning' testimony on 'The Story.' Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis, who is prosecuting former Trump on charges of attempting to overturn the 2020 election, verbally sparred with lawyers for hours at an evidentiary hearing regarding her relationship with the lead prosecutor who she hired to bring the case against Trump. At one point, presiding Judge Scott McAfee called a five-minute recess to apparently let tempers cool down. When court was back in session , he told lawyers to stop ""talking over each other"" and cautioned Willis, saying, ""we have to listen to the questions as asked. And if this happens again and again, I'm going to have no choice but to strike your testimony."" Willis, who was notably adverse to defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant, said she ""had some choice words about some of the things"" Merchant and her client Michael Roman — Trump's codefendant in the case — said in the motion. Willis called the motion ""dishonest."" HEARING UNDERWAY ON EVIDENCE AGAINST DA FANI WILLIS IN Trump CASE THAT COULD DISQUALIFY HER Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade, who has reached a temporary divorce settlement with his estranged wife. Roman alleged in court filings last month that Willis should be disqualified from the case, claiming that she financially benefited from hiring Wade because of their personal relationship. Willis Thursday said she had ""some choice words"" about Roman's motion, calling some of the allegations ""dishonest"" and ""extremely offensive."" At one point, Willis held up a printed copy of the allegations against her in both hands and turned to the judge yelling, ""this is a lie!"" Willis also called defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant's interests ""contrary to democracy."" Willis took the stand following several witnesses, including Wade and Willis' former friend Robin Yeartie who testified that she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade had a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019, contradicting Willis’ prior statements to the court. Much of Willis' testimony focused on vacations she took with Wade, including Carribean cruises and visiting wine country California. Both testified that Wade routinely paid for the trips and Willis would reimburse him with cash. When repeatedly pressed about whether any records existed for her withdrawals of the funds, she said she was accustomed and taught by her father to keep 6 months of regular expenses on hand in cash. Wade took the stand earlier in the hearing. Craig Gillen, attorney for Trump co-defendant David Shafer who also asked the court to disqualify Willis, questioned Wade earlier about Willis' repayments to him for vacations that were made in cash. Wade admitted that he did not have deposit slips or receipts to support his claims. ""You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash, do you?"" Gillen asked. ""No, sir,"" Wade said. ""Not a single solitary one,"" Gillen pressed. ""Not a one."" The defense is trying to prove the existence and extent of any financial benefit to Willis from Wade from their relationship, which is the crux of their argument that Willis should be disqualified. Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade testifies during a hearing Thursday.ter-Pool/Getty Images)) Wade also testified that he was not paid by Fulton County as much as the defense claims . In 2022 specifically, Fulton County paid roughly $300,000 to his law firm. But Wade said he received roughly $100,000 because the payments were dispersed between the three people who worked at the firm, all of whom had contracts with the Fulton County DA's office for various reasons. Wade's testimony contradicts earlier bombshell revelations from a former ""good friend"" of DA Willis who testified Thursday that she has ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade had a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019, contradicting Willis’ prior statements to the court. Robin Yeartie, a former Fulton County DA employee and self-described ""good friend"" of Willis, said Thursday she has ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade were in a romantic relationship starting in 2019 to when she and Willis last spoke in 2022. HOUSE COMMITTEE SUBPOENAS FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman.) This contradicts Willis’ claims in court that she and Wade ""have been professional associates and friends since 2019,"" and ""there was no personal relationship"" between her and Wade in November 2021 at the time of Wade’s appointment. ""You have no doubt that their romantic relationship was in effect from 2019 until the last time you spoke with her?"" Merchant questioned. ""No doubt,"" Yeartie said. Yeartie said that she and Willis met in college, and when she was employed in the district attorney's office she and Willis were ""good friends,"" but had not spoken since 2022, after Yeartie resigned from her post. Yeartie testified that she knew Willis and Wade began their relationship shortly after meeting at a conference in Nov. 2019. ""And when I say personal – romantic,"" Merchant probed. ""I just want to make sure we don't get in an argument over what personal and romantic is,"" she said. EMBATTLED DA FANI WILLIS FACES 4TH ACCUSATION TO DISQUALIFY HER FROM THE Trump CASE Fulton County, Georgia district attorney Fani Willis, who brought charges against former Trump on election interference, is taking heat from all sides. ""Yes,"" Yeartie responded. Yeartie was asked whether she saw Willis and Wade ""interact on a personal level"" since she would see Willis at work ""every day."" ""And so from everything that you saw, heard, witnessed, is your understanding that they were in a romantic relationship, beginning in 2019?"" Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ""Yes,"" Yeartie said. When asked by Steve Stadow, a lawyer for former Trump, Yeartie confirmed that she observed Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November first of 2021. Yeartie testified that Willis subleased her condo starting in April 2021, which Wade claimed he visited. He also said he has never been around other members of the DA’s office at her condo. Judge McAfee said earlier in the week that depending on his findings after hearing the evidence presented from both sides, Willis could be disqualified from the case. ""In studying the law that's been filed up to this point, I think it's clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one. And the filing submitted on this issue so far have presented a conflict in the evidence that can't be resolved as a matter of law,"" he said. McAfee was appointed to the bench by Republican Governor Brian Kemp in 2021. And that is no longer a matter of complete speculation. The state has admitted a relationship existed. And so, what remains to be proven is the existence and extent of any financial benefit,"" the judge said. ""So, because I think it's possible that the facts alleged by the defendant could result in disqualification, I think an evidentiary hearing must occur to establish the record on those core allegations,"" he said","['fani', 'willis', 'judge', 'frustrated', 'witness', 'gamesmanship', 'matthew', 'whitaker', 'acting', 'attorney', 'general', 'matthew', 'whitaker', 'reacts', 'fani', 'willis',

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently told Secretary of State Antony Blinken that any U.S. recognition of a Palestinian state would be a ""prize"" for the Hamas terrorists who planned the Oct. 7 massacre. Netanyahu made the comment to Blinken when the pair met face-to-face last week, Axios reported Thursday. The prime minister told Blinken that direct or even indirect recognition ""would be a prize for those who planned and orchestrated the Oct. 7 massacre."" Biden and other U.S. officials have repeatedly said that Israel's war against Hamas should end with a two-state solution, implying that the U.S. would recognize a Palestinian state. The U.S. could potentially recognize a Palestinian state indirectly by not using its veto to stop the U.N. from fully recognizing Palestinian officials as a member state.

Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi also met with Palestinian minister Hussein al-Sheikh last week and told him he would receive the same answer from future Israeli governments, an Israeli official told Axios. UNITED NATIONS SLAMMED FOR SILENCE OVER HAMAS RAPES, MUTILATION AND MURDER OF ISRAELI WOMEN, CRITICS SAY ""It is not only the Likud government. There was no Palestinian state when we had other governments in Israel, so you need to be realistic and put forward more practical goals for the day after the war,"" Hanegbi told al-Sheikh. Biden has made it clear that he wants the Israel-Hamas war to end with a two-state solution for Palestinians, but Israel is proving unwilling. Biden first pushed for a two-state solution in a November 2023 opinion article in the Washington Post, arguing, ""The Palestinian people deserve a state of their own and a future free from Hamas."" 'I WILL BE HAUNTED FOREVER’: ISRAEL’S HORRIFIC VIDEO OF HAMAS ATROCITIES LEAVES VIEWERS SHOCKED AND SICKENED Israel has made repeated efforts to negotiate a peace deal and two-state solution with Palestinian and Arab leaders over the past 75 years, but each offer has been rejected. ""I do not think a two-state solution is possible, and, even if possible, it is not advisable. For more than 50 years, hundreds of self-proclaimed ‘peacemakers,’ led by the United States, have attempted to coerce Israel and the Palestinians into a two-state solution,"" former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman told Fox News Digital last month.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-appear-new-york-city-court-hearing-criminal-case-da-alvin-braggs-investigation,"WATCH LIVE: Trump makes appearance in NY court as first criminal case against him nears trial The judge is expected to announce his decision on several issues, including the former president’s motion to dismiss the case. A NewYork City judge denied former Trump's request to dismiss charges stemming from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's investigation into hush-money payments ahead of the 2016 presidential election and formally announced the trial will begin next month. The trial is now scheduled to begin with jury selection on March 25, and Judge Juan Merchan said the trial is expected to last 6 weeks. Trump appeared in a NewYork City courtroom Thursday morning for a hearing. Bragg indicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree in April. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges. COURT DATES AND PRIMARIES: Trump FACES COMPETING CALENDARS IN 2024 NewYork District Attorney Alvin Bragg had been investigating former Trump for alleged hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump and his attorneys sought to have the case dismissed altogether, but Judge Merchan on Thursday denied the request. Before entering court, Trump blasted Bragg for rising crime in NewYork City, and the case. ""I'm here for something, it's not a crime, it's election interference and it's being run by Biden's White House,"" Trump said, calling it a ""terrible time for our country. A real dark period."" Trump went on to say Biden has ""accomplished nothing."" Trump said he should be out campaigning, instead of in court, ahead of the SouthCarolina primary on Feb. 24. When pressed on when he will campaign during the trial, Trump replied: ""I'll do it in the evening."" The trial will take place just after the Louisiana primary and ahead of April 2, when Connecticut, Delaware, NewYork, Rhode Island and Wisconsin voter hit the polls to select a GOP nominee. Bragg alleged Trump ""repeatedly and fraudulently falsified NewYork business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election."" Trump SLAMS BRAGG AFTER PLEADING NOT GUILTY: 'I NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN IN AMERICA' The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Stormy Daniels reacted to former Trump's arraignment with an X-rated tweet. In 2019, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of NewYork opted out of charging Trump related to the payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. The Federal Election Commission also tossed its investigation into the matter in 2021. Trump PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 34 FELONY COUNTS OF FALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS LINKED TO 2016 HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS Former Trump sits at the defense table with his defense team in a Manhattan court April 4, 2023, in NewYork City.

Immigration experts are raising the alarm about how the increasing flow of migrants illegally crossing into the U.S. may significantly impact states' representation in the House of Representatives and Electoral College. Shortly after taking office in January 2021, Biden signed an executive order requiring that the U.S. Census Bureau factor in all residents, including noncitizens, as part of its decennial calculation of the U.S. population. As a result, the apportionment of House seats and, therefore, electoral vote for presidential elections, could be swayed as migrants continue to pour over the southern border. ""Illegal immigration has all kinds of effects and among them is that it distorts the mechanics of Democrat government,"" Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Illegal immigrants aren't even supposed to be here, so their inclusion in the census count for purposes of apportionment really is outrageous."" ""There are a lot of close vote in Congress, more than there used to be. So, it can, in fact, make a difference,"" Krikorian said. ""It shouldn't be a question of: Does this give you personally more influence in Washington? The question should be: Is it right? Is it healthy for our Democrat process to be distorted this way? The answer is no."" REPUBLICANS PROBE DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER ROLE IN HOUSING MIGRANTS ON FEDERAL LANDS On his first day in office, Biden issued an executive order mandating that illegal immigrants are counted toward the U.S. census. Overall, according to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, there are an estimated 16.8 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. as of June 2023. Therefore, because every House seat represents 761,168 residents on average, the total number of illegal immigrants account for roughly 22 seats in the House. And the most recent census, which was conducted in 2020, reduced the number of House seats apportioned to NewYork from 27 to 26. The state, according to the Census Bureau, would have needed just 89 more residents to maintain its previous apportionment, a calculation that highlights how fragile states' House seat levels are. REPUBLICANS ACCELERATE PROBE INTO Biden ADMINISTRATION'S ACTIONS TO HOUSE MIGRANTS ON FEDERAL LANDS In addition, electoral vote for presidential elections are distributed to states based on how many representatives in Congress they have. Therefore, a state with a larger number of House seats has greater influence during presidential elections every four years. ""It doesn't get enough attention, and with millions coming in right now, it deserves a bright, hot spotlight,"" Lora Ries, director of the Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center, told Fox News Digital in an interview. Migrants attempting to cross into the U.S. from Mexico are detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in San Luis, Arizona. Earlier this month, Ries published an essay alongside RJ Hauman, the president of the Immigration Center For Enforcement, warning that illegal immigration is triggering a ""warped representation"" in Congress. ""Barring the Census from including noncitizens in apportionment is critical in making sure that American citizens — the only population who can and should vote in U.S. elections — are picking America’s leaders,"" Ries and Hauman wrote. ""Biden intentional border crisis has produced unprecedented apportionment issues, distorting the representation that states have in the House, and how many electoral vote they have in presidential elections."" MAYOR'S OFFICE AVOIDS SAYING WHETHER IT BACKS NONCITIZENS VOTING AFTER WARNING MIGRANT CRISIS WILL DESTROY NYC The pair argued that prohibiting the Census Bureau from counting illegal immigrants toward its apportionment population would discourage sanctuary policies in Democrat-led cities and states. They further argued that such a policy would ensure that only American citizens ""shape our political landscape"" and prevent foreign nationals from determining the political destiny of the U.S. Ries and Hauman also called for Congress to pass the Equal Representation Act, which Sens. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., Bill Cassidy, R-La., and 20 fellow Senate Republican introduced late last month. Under the legislation, the Census Bureau would be required to include a citizenship question in any future census and prohibit noncitizens from being counted for congressional district and Electoral College apportionment. Reps. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., and Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, introduced companion legislation in the House days later. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., introduced the Equal Representation Act in January. The bill would ensure only American citizens are factored in for future House and Electoral College apportionment. ""It is unconscionable that illegal immigrants and noncitizens are counted toward congressional district apportionment and our electoral map,"" said Hagerty. ""While people continue to flee Democrat-run cities, desperate Democrat are back-filling the mass exodus with illegal immigrants so that they do not lose their seats in Congress and maintain electoral vote for the presidency and hence artificially boost their political power, which in turn dilutes the power of other Americans’ vote,"" he added. REPUBLICANS FUME AT Biden FOR VACATIONING AS BORDER CROSSINGS EXPLODE: 'DERELICTION OF DUTY' Hagerty's bill comes years after former Trump attempted to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census questionnaire. Trump's effort sparked widespread criticism and condemnation from Democrat and left-wing immigration groups who argued that a citizenship question was unlawful and was designed to help Republican in future elections. The Trump administration ultimately abandoned the effort in July 2019 after an unfavorable SupremeCourt ruling. Trump said at the time that allowing noncitizens to be counted was ""part of a broader left-wing effort to erode the rights of the American citizen."" ""We will defend the right of the American people to know the full facts about the population size of citizens and noncitizens in America,"" Trump said in 2019. ""It is essential that we have a clear breakdown of the number of citizens and noncitizens that make up the U.S. populations."" ""It obviously helps states that have a high illegal immigrant population. The best way to say it is it's a perverse incentive to states to grow their population through illegal immigration,"" Eric Ruark, the director of research for NumbersUSA, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Federal dollars are also based upon population. States who have a higher illegal immigrant population are going to see more federal funding."" ""To have a Democrat society, you need to recognize limits on who qualifies as a citizen or as someone who has representation,"" Ruark continued. southern border, a slight year-over-year uptick but a decrease compared to the month prior. In December, more than 302,000 migrants were encountered crossing the border, by far the largest single-month figure ever recorded. The December figures brought the fiscal 2024 first-quarter level to 785,000 encounters, the highest number ever recorded. The U.S. Census Bureau will conduct its next census in 2030, which will impact House seats beginning in 2033","['chinese', 'migrants', 'flooding', 'southern', 'border', 'spark', 'national',

EXCLUSIVE: Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was forced to backpedal on holding a House vote on renewing and revising a key surveillance tool of the U.S. government after a bloc of GOP lawmakers threatened a mutiny , Fox News Digital has learned. The House Rules Committee had been partially through considering a bill to renew Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act when Johnson’s spokesperson announced that a planned House-wide vote would not happen this week as expected. The Rules panel, which had to approve the bill before it hit the House floor, abruptly called off the rest of its session with no explanation. But four sources told Fox News Digital that all progress on the FISA bill would be postponed until a later date because members of the House Intelligence Committee threatened to tank a procedural vote to effectively kill the legislation. Speaker Mike Johnson was forced to scuttle an expected FISA House vote this week. ""Instead of playing the game through Rules and regular order, Intel decided to take their ball and go home, walking away from the negotiated text and amendment plan without any understanding of why,"" one source said. Three more sources close to the Intelligence Committee challenged that narrative to Fox News Digital, saying the bill text was changed over the weekend without their consent or the consent of the House Judiciary Committee, which also worked on the bill. They said the issue was primarily with an amendment offered by Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus who does not sit on either committee. One of those two sources said Davidson’s amendment was not ""germane"" to the compromise text, meaning it was ineligible for consideration because it was not deemed relevant to the bill – until the text was allegedly altered over the weekend. PUBLIC TRUST IN FBI HAS REACHED 'THE RED ZONE,' US INCHING CLOSER TO 'MAYHEM, CHAOS, ANARCHY:' WSJ COLUMNIST ""Someone in leadership staff ended up drafting text that got inserted into the base text over the weekend, so they basically airdropped … this one paragraph into the base text that now makes that amendment germane,"" that source said. ""The amendment totally screws FISA, the text that was added totally screws FISA in terms of its ability to be a national security tool."" That source said taking a chance on whether Davidson’s amendment will pass was like ""playing Russian roulette."" The House Freedom Caucus is critical of the Intel Committee's FISA bill. Section 702 has been both credited with preventing terror attacks on U.S. soil and accused of being a vehicle for spying on U.S. citizens. It lets the government keep tabs on specific foreign nationals outside the country without first obtaining a warrant to do so, even if the party on the other side of those communications is an American on U.S. soil . Davidson’s proposed amendment would have forced feds acting within FISA to seek a warrant before trying to obtain third-party-owned communications and location data of a U.S. citizen. The bill intended to come to the floor this week was the product of monthslong talks between the Judiciary and Intelligence panels. Both sides agreed that Section 702 needs to be reformed, and a task force of seven lawmakers was created to hash out the compromise, two sources said. Judiciary members, along with a coalition of GOP hard-liners and progressives , saw FISA as a tool abused to spy on Americans and sought severe restrictions. Intelligence Committee members argued their restrictions would have rendered it ineffective as a tool to stop terror attacks. GUN RIGHTS GROUP URGES SENATORS TO PRESS YELLEN OVER TREASURY TARGETING GUN TRANSACTIONS Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill., who is on Intelligence, agreed FISA needs reforms and defended his panel’s work on the matter but insisted the warrant aspect could hinder efforts to prevent threats to Americans. He said the committee’s proposed emphasis on more transparency and oversight of the FISA court would ""help remedy these problems and puts us on the best path forward to protect national security, and secondly, to hold the FBI accountable."" LaHood also pointed to a letter signed by Trump-era national security officials affirming support for his committee’s version of the bill. Rep. Warren Davidson's amendment is allegedly a big part of the issue. ""This was airdropped in there,"" the second source close to the Intelligence Committee said of text related to Davidson’s amendment. ""This was not something that the seven members of the working group had ever digested, ever looked at. So really, it was disingenuous to think that that would be a part of that. And essentially, [House GOP leadership] agreed."" That source said Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., were ""surprised"" to hear that the legislative text was altered. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., an ally of Davidson’s who supported his warrant amendment, hit back at the Intelligence Committee’s reform efforts, saying, ""Intel didn’t want the Judiciary [amendments]. See, the Judiciary Committee is the committee of jurisdiction. That’s where it should’ve gone."" But the third source close to the Intelligence Committee said those on the panel ""are the ones that see the threats to our nation up close and personal every day."" It’s not immediately clear when House GOP leaders plan to bring the bill back up. House leadership has until April 19 before Section 702 expires. Johnson’s and Davidson's offices did not immediately provide comment.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/montana-conservative-withdraws-senate-race-trump-endorsement,"Tim Sheehy launches six-figure TV and digital ad buy as 'Trump-endorsed conservative' in Montana Senate race In a six-figure TV and digital ad buy across Montana, former Navy SEAL and Senate candidate Tim Sheehy highlights being endorsed by former Trump. Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., suspended his bid for the Montana Senate on Thursday, telling Fox News that former Trump was a factor that led to his decision. Rosendale, a notable conservative firebrand, announced he was running for Senate on Friday, in an effort to unseat Democrat Sen. Jon Tester. Just six days later, Rosendale has withdrawn from the race as his bid stirred up the state’s Republican primary race where he was going to be challenging former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy for the nomination. Sheehy, a first-time candidate, gained endorsements from Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.; Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont.; Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte; and Trump. CONSERVATIVE FIREBRAND ANNOUNCES RUN FOR KEY BATTLEGROUND SENATE RACE BEING TARGETED BY DEMS Montana Republican Congressman Matt Rosendale speaks at the ceremony to honor the four airmen killed in a 1962 B-47 crash at 8,500 feet on Emigrant Peak in Emigrant, Montana, on July 24, 2021. ""[W]ith Trump endorsing my opponent and the lack of resources, the hill was just too steep,"" Rosendale said. ""I spoke with Sen. Daines earlier this week and we both agree that this is the best path forward for Republican to regain the majority in the U.S. Senate."" Rosendale said he planned to run for Senate and to win both the primary and general election, but the same day he announced his bid, Trump announced his endorsement of Sheehy . FORMER NAVY SEAL SAYS DEMS MEDDLING IN HIS SENATE RACE ‘TO DISTRICT MONTANA VOTERS’ FROM ‘TWO-FACED’ OPPONENT Trump, right, endorsed Tim Sheehy for the Montana Senate. Despite not getting the endorsement, Rosendale said he will continue to be a supporter of Trump . When he did not get the endorsement, Rosendale had to calculate his chances of winning without a Trump endorsement. ""This race was already going to be tough, as I was fighting against Mitch McConnell and the rest of the Republican establishment in Washington,"" he said. ""But I felt like I could beat them, as the voter do not agree with them choosing who would be the next U.S. Senator from Montana."" DONALD Trump ENDORSES ‘AMERICAN HERO’ TIM SHEEHY IN BATTLEGROUND SENATE RACE Rosendale added he would be back home in Montana with his family over the next few days to consider what he will pursue next.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/haley-spotlights-trump-chaos-judge-sets-former-presidents-hush-money-trial-start-march,"Jonathan Turley: Split screen of dual hearings is 'golden' for Trump Fox News contributors Jonathan Turley and Karl Rove weigh in on a hearing on misconduct allegations against Fulton County, Georgia, DA Fani Willis while Trump appears in court in NewYork. The move by a NewYork judge to set a March 25 trial date in former Trump's hush money case is giving Republican presidential rival Nikki Haley more ammunition. ""Trump is in court today. There will be a verdict on another case tomorrow. And he has a trial starting March 25. Meanwhile, he’s spending millions of campaign donations on legal fees. All of this chaos will only lead to more losses for Republican up and down the ticket,"" Haley argued Thursday in a social media post. Haley, a former two-term SouthCarolina governor who later served as U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration, is the last remaining major rival challenging Trump for the GOP nomination. But she faces a steep uphill climb against Trump, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the 2024 Republican presidential race. Trump BID TO DISMISS HUSH MONEY INDICTMENT DENIED, TRIAL TO START NEXT MONTH Nikki Haley speaks during a campaign event at the Orangeburg Mall in Orangeburg, SouthCarolina, on Sunday. Haley's comments came soon after a NewYork City judge denied Trump's request to dismiss the indictment. The former president faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in NewYork in connection with alleged hush money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels made during the 2016 presidential campaign. COURT DATES AND PRIMARIES: Trump FACES COMPETING CALENDARS IN 2024 Prosecutors argue the payments were an effort by Trump to hide a potential sex scandal, both before and after the 2016 election. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges, which were brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who is a Democrat. The ruling sets up the first criminal trial of a former president in the nation's history. Trump attends a pre-trial hearing at Manhattan Criminal Court in NewYork City on Thursday. Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records last year. As he entered the courtroom, Trump claimed, ""I'm here for something, it's not a crime, it's election interference and it's being run by Biden's White House,"" And he reiterated that it's a ""terrible time for our country. A real dark period."" Trump faces four trials this year, including two on charges he aimed to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. ONE YEAR AFTER LAUNCHING 2024 BID, HALEY MAKES FINAL STAND AGAINST Trump Haley, pointing in part to Trump's legal entanglements, has repeatedly charged that Trump is ""unhinged"" and argued that ""chaos"" will follow if he returns to the White House. And she has regularly highlighted general election polls that suggest she's a stronger GOP nominee than Trump to take on Biden in November. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Trump. The judge in the hush money case, Juan Merchan, said the trial could last five to six weeks, with a possible ending in late April or early May. When pressed on when he will campaign during the trial, Trump replied: ""I'll do it in the evening.""

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-informant-charged-giving-false-information-hunter-biden-2020,"Republican believe Tony Bobulinski's interview on HunterBiden Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on allegations about the Biden family's business dealings on 'Special Report.' Special Counsel David Weiss has charged an FBI informant with giving false information after he alleged that Biden and HunterBiden were paid millions in exchange for their help firing the Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma Holdings, according to court documents unsealed Thursday. Alexander Smirnov, 43, is charged with making a false statement and creating a false and fictitious record during FBI interviews. HunterBiden, son of U.S. Biden, departs a House Oversight Committee meeting at Capitol Hill on January 10, 2024 in Washington, DC. Prosecutors say Smirnov was arrested at the Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada Wednesday after a federal grand jury returned an indictment. Smirnov appeared in court in Las Vegas later Thursday where he did not enter a plea, per reporting from The Associated Press. The judge ordered the courtroom cleared after federal public defender Margaret Wightman Lambrose requested a closed hearing for arguments about sealing court documents. She declined to comment on the case. According to the indictment, Smirnov gave ""false derogatory information"" to the FBI despite ""repeated admonishments that he must provide truthful information and that he must not fabricate evidence."" The indictment says Smirnov told an FBI agent in March 2017 that he had a phone call with Burisma’s owner concerning the firm potentially acquiring a U.S. company and making an initial public offering on a U.S.-based stock exchange. In reporting this conversation to the FBI agent, Smirnov said HunterBiden was a board member of Burisma, though this was publicly known. Biden, NOT SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR, BROUGHT UP SON'S DEATH IN QUESTIONING In June 2020, Smirnov is accused of having told the FBI, for the first time, about two meetings he had four to five years prior, in which executives associated with Burisma supposedly admitted that they hired HunterBiden to ""protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."" During this meeting, the indictment alleges that Smirnov said the executives paid $5 million to each of the Biden while Biden was still in office. The indictment alleges that Smirnov falsely claimed the Biden were paid so that HunterBiden, with his dad’s help, could take care of a criminal investigation being conducted by the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General, Viktor Shokin, into Burisma. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, claims a Burisma executive who allegedly paid then Vice Biden $5 million has 17 audio recordings of calls with the Biden. The indictment alleges that this information given by Smirnov in June 2020 was a fabrication. Prosecutors say Smirnov did have contact with Burisma executives in 2017, but when Biden was out of public office and had no ability to influence U.S. policy and after the Ukrainian Prosecutor General had been fired in February 2016. The indictment alleges that Smirnov transformed his ""routine and unextraordinary"" business contacts with Burisma in 2017 and later bribery allegations against Biden after expressing bias against him and his presidential candidacy. FBI DIRECTOR SAYS CHINESE HACKERS ARE ‘POISED TO ATTACK’ AS INFILTRATIONS REACH ‘FEVER PITCH’ Smirnov is accused of repeating some of his false claims during an interview with FBI agents in September 2023, while changing other bits of information, and promoting a new false narrative after claiming to have met with Russian officials. If convicted, Smirnov faces a maximum of 25 years in prison. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley were approached by a whistleblower last summer who alleged that the FBI was in possession of a document — an FD-1023 form, dated June 30, 2020 — which explicitly detailed information provided by a confidential human source alleging Biden, while serving as vice president, was involved in a multi-million-dollar scheme with a foreign national in exchange for influence over policy decisions. The source told Fox News Digital that the confidential human source was used by the FBI for ""at least several years"" before the FD-1023 form, and was ""found to be highly credible "" by the FBI. Comer said Thursday that FBI Director Christopher Wray refused a request from him and Grassley last summer for the public release of the form because the bureau ""claimed it would jeopardize the safety of a confidential human source who they claimed was invaluable to the FBI."" Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., arrives for the House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing titled ""Unsuitable Litigation: Oversight of Third-Party Litigation Funding"" in Rayburn Building on Wednesday, September 13, 2023. Comer said the bureau informed him that the source was ""credible and trusted, had worked with the FBI for over a decade, and have been paid six figures."" ""The FBI's actions in this matter are very concerning. The FBI had this form for years and it appears they did nothing to verify the troubling claims contained within the record until Congress became aware of and demanded access to them,"" Comer said. Comer said the FBI's FD-1023 form is not being used in an impeachment inquiry against the president. The impeachment inquiry, he said, ""is based on a large record of evidence, including bank records and witness testimony, revealing that Biden knew of and participated in his family’s business dealings."" ""Just this week, we had another witness confirm Biden was the brand being sold by the Biden around the world. Biden continues to lie to the American people about this matter and the American people demand the truth and accountability for any wrongdoing. We will continue to follow the facts to propose legislation to reform federal ethics laws and to determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted."" Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Grassley told Fox News Digital that the indictment ""confirms several points Senator Grassley has made repeatedly."" WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 6: Sen. Chuck Grassley arrives for a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on judicial nominations on Capitol Hill September 6, 2023 in Washington, DC. ""The informant behind the FD-1023 was, indeed, a long-serving, trusted FBI source used by the agency for criminal investigations since the Obama administration. In fact, he was so trusted that the FBI provided him authorization ‘to engage in illegal activity for investigative purposes,'"" the spokesperson said. ""But, when presented with information from a source the agency so trusted, the FBI – as exposed by Senator Grassley – sat on the document for years, without performing due diligence."" The spokesperson added: ""It’s clear that only after Senator Grassley made the FD-1023 public did the FBI investigate the allegations in the document."" Grassley has sought to ""ensure the DOJ and FBI investigated the FD-1023."" ""Today’s indictment makes clear that, without Senator Grassley’s oversight and exposure of the FD-1023, the agency would have continued neglecting its duties and failing to provide the transparency the American people deserve,"" the spokesperson said","['republican', 'believe', 'tony', 'bobulinskis', 'interview', 'hunterbiden', 'correspondent', 'david', 'spunt', 'latest', 'allegations', 'biden',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tony-bobulinski-attorney-accuses-oversight-dems-gaslighting-false-smears-hunter-biden-associate,"Bobulinski: 'I think Biden and the Biden family are compromised' Ex-HunterBiden associate details deals with Chinese Communist Party-connected company on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' An attorney for HunterBiden’s ex-business associate Tony Bobulinski accused House Democrat of ""abusive conduct and disingenuous mischaracterizations"" of his testimony on the Biden family's business dealings. In a letter to Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member and lead Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Bobulinski's counsel Stefan Passantino asserted that Democrat were attempting to assassinate his client's character. ""We are watching the death throes of a political narrative that will be shattered upon the imminent public release of Mr. Bobulinski’s testimony before the House Committees on Oversight and Judiciary yesterday,"" Passantino wrote. ""The facts are before Congress and will soon be before the American people. Minority assassination of Mr. Bobulinski’s character and grotesque mischaracterizations of his words will only serve to highlight the gaslighting and vilification Mr. Bobulinski has endured since he reluctantly came forward almost four years ago to share with the public the facts of his business experience with the Biden family,"" the letter continues. JOE Biden IS ‘THE BIG GUY,’ TONY BOBULINSKI SAID DURING ‘UNSHAKEABLE’ TESTIMONY AMID IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY Tony Bobulinski, a former associate of HunterBiden, talks with reporters before the presidential debate in in Nashville, Tennessee, on Oct. 22, 2020. ""As the public will see soon enough, Mr. Bobulinski has the facts and the receipts, and no amount of character assassination will change that."" Bobulinski testified behind closed doors for more than eight hours on Tuesday as part of the House impeachment inquiry against Biden. He is one of the Republican' star witnesses, having worked with HunterBiden to create the joint-venture SinoHawk Holdings with Chinese energy company CEFC. READ THE LETTER BELOW. APP USERS: CLICK HERE Behind closed doors, sources said Bobulinski told the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees that he had ""personally met"" with Biden in May 2017 in Los Angeles on the sidelines of the Milken Conference for somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour. Fox News Digital first reported on that meetings between Bobulinski and Biden in October 2020. JOE Biden 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES House Oversight Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. Biden, on May 3, 2017, spoke at the conference, hosting ""A Conversation with the 47th Vice President of the United States Biden."" Just days after the May 2, 2017, meeting came the now-infamous May 13, 2017, email, which included a discussion of ""remuneration packages"" for six people in a business deal with a Chinese energy firm . The email appeared to identify Biden as ""Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC,"" in a reference to the now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co. The email includes a note that ""Hunter has some office expectations he will elaborate."" A proposed equity split references ""20"" for ""H"" and ""10 held by H for the big guy?"" with no further details. Bobulinski testified Tuesday that Biden is ""the big guy,"" a claim he has made since 2020. IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, who claimed that politics had influenced the yearslong federal investigation into HunterBiden, have also said ""the big guy"" was known to be Biden. FLASHBACK: HUNTER Biden BUSINESS ASSOCIATE'S TEXT MESSAGES INDICATE MEETING WITH JOE Biden HunterBiden departs a House Oversight Committee meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 10. Bobulinski claims that Biden was ""the Brand"" sold by HunterBiden and other family members as part of a ""foreign influence peddling operation."" Biden has repeatedly denied any involvement in his son Hunter's business dealings . House Democrat have rallied behind the president, with Raskin claiming that Bobulinski ""offers absolutely no testimony that indicates any criminal activity by Biden... or evidence that Biden was involved in HunterBiden's businesses."" In the letter, Passantino said Raskin's statement is ""categorically false"" and pushed back against other claims made by House Democrat, insisting that a soon-to-be-released transcript of Bobulinski's testimony will prove them wrong. ""Equally concerning are the false allegations impugning Mr. Bobulinski’s character and statements about law enforcement. Unlike those making these accusations, Mr. Bobulinski has a proud and exemplary history of serving this country in the military and his patriotism cannot be questioned,"" Passantino wrote. BOBULINSKI OFFERED TO TESTIFY AT HUNTER Biden GRAND JURY BUT 'NEVER HEARD BACK': SOURCE Video ""As the transcript will show, Mr. Bobulinski did NOT accuse the FBI of lying about his voluntary statements before them in October 2020. The transcript will show that when Mr. Bobulinski was asked by the Minority about second-hand accounts of his words rather than asking him direct questions, Mr. Bobulinski simply corrected errors in the FBI’s internal 302 report about his statements."" ""As Mr. Bobulinski testified yesterday, these errors could have been corrected years ago if Mr. Bobulinski had been shown the FBI’s internal summary or if ANY government agency had reached out to us at the time,"" the letter states. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for House Oversight Democrat pointed to several statements from committee members questioning Bobulinski's credibility as a witness. Democrat have urged the committee to release the transcript of his testimony after Oversight Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., accused them of ""witness intimidation."" ""Let’s read between the lines here: we asked questions on the very real credibility issues with your witness,"" Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, posted on X. You invited a sham witness and we asked basic questions — his lack of credibility is on you! Why not release the transcript?"" posted Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif. President BIden's brother, Jim Biden, will be the next witness to testify to the committee as part of the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday. HunterBiden is expected to appear for his deposition on Feb. 28","['bobulinski', 'biden', 'biden', 'family', 'compromised', 'exhunterbiden', 'associate', 'details', 'deals', 'chinese', 'communist',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-redistricting-commission-approves-new-congressional-map,"Fox News Flash top headlines for February 15 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. NewYork's bipartisan redistricting commission on Thursday approved a new congressional map, modifying three competitive districts but leaving the rest of the state's boundaries unchanged. The plan is likely to complicate the re-election prospects of freshman Republican Rep. Brandon Williams, whose Syracuse-centric district has taken on significantly bluer terrain. Democrat Rep. Pat Ryan and Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro, meanwhile, stand to benefit most under the new lines, with their districts being drawn into significantly bluer and redder territory, respectively. NewYork’s bipartisan redistricting commission approved a new congressional map Thursday that makes modest changes to three competitive districts but does not substantially change the rest of the state's lines. The map proposal now moves to the Democrat-dominated Legislature , which can approve the plan or reject it and draw its own lines. It's unclear exactly when lawmakers would meet to vote on the commission's map. NewYork's congressional redistricting process has been closely watched this year as suburban races in the state could have outsize influence on which party controls the House after the November elections. NY ELECTION LAW THAT 'NATIONALIZES' LOCAL POLITICS FLIES UNDER THE RADAR DESPITE BEING 'MONUMENTAL': EXPERT The redistricting commission was tasked with coming up with new districts after the state's highest court in December threw out the map used in the 2022 elections. Democrat had sued to nix the old map after their party lost a handful of suburban seats in a series of bruising defeats that helped Republican win a narrow House majority. The panel's new map plan leaves the most of the current congressional districts largely in place, a move that could help head off legal challenges against the proposal. It also could act to sooth at least some concerns from Republican that the new plan would leave them with a radically gerrymandered playing field for the fall. The NewYork state Capitol is seen prior to Gov. Kathy Hochul delivering her State of the State address in the Assembly Chamber at the state Capitol, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2023, in Albany, N.Y. The most major change appears to be in the upstate district currently held by Republican Rep. Brandon Williams. The commission would shift the district, which is situated over Syracuse, to include the cities of Auburn and Cortland. The other big adjustments would be in the neighboring districts held by Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro and Democrat Rep. Pat Ryan. The plan would stretch Ryan's district north to include Woodstock, while Molinaro's district would expand to include sections of the state east of Albany. The state's Independent Redistricting Commission was supposed to draw the districts used in 2022 but failed to reach a consensus, kicking the process to state lawmakers. Democrat who control the Legislature then drew their own map, which was intended to give Democrat an edge by stuffing Republican into a few super districts to dilute GOP voting power across the state. A lawsuit eventually stopped the Democrat' map from being used and a legal challenge delayed the congressional primaries. The state's highest court then appointed an outside expert to come up with a map for 2022. Republican performed well under those congressional lines, flipping seats in the NewYork City suburbs and winning a narrow House majority. After the defeats, Democrat sued to throw out the 2022 map. The case eventually reached the state's high court, which in December ordered a new map to be drawn in a ruling that said the commission should have another chance to craft district lines. This time around, the state's redistricting commission was able to reach a consensus on a map proposal, approving a plan that did not dramatically shift district lines in an apparent effort to avoid another legal challenge that could disrupt campaigning. The panel approved the map by a vote of 9-1 during a brief hearing in Albany. The proposal leaves congressional boundaries on Long Island, where races are expected to be hotly contested, mostly unchanged, including the district formerly held by George Santos , who was expelled from Congress, and won this week by Democrat Tom Suozzi in a special election. NewYork City's lines also appeared largely unchanged. ""It was important for us not to enter into the process of confusing people out there over where they were going to vote,"" said redistricting commission Vice Chair Charles Nesbitt. The panel is made up of an equal number of Republican and Democrat.","['flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'february', '15', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'whats', 'clicking', 'foxnewscom', 'newyorks', 'bipartisan', 'redistricting', 'commission', 'thursday', 'approved', 'new', 'congressional', 'map', 'modifying', 'three', 'competitive', 'districts', 'leaving', 'rest', 'states', 'boundaries', 'unchanged', 'plan', 'likely', 'complicate', 'reelection', 'prospects', 'freshman', 'republican', 'rep', 'brandon', 'williams', 'whose', 'syracusecentric', 'district', 'taken', 'significantly', 'bluer', 'terrain', 'democrat', 'rep', 'pat', 'ryan', 'republican', 'rep', 'marc', 'molinaro', 'meanwhile', 'stand', 'benefit', 'new', 'lines', 'districts', 'drawn', 'significantly', 'bluer', 'redder', 'territory', 'respectively', 'newyork’s', 'bipartisan', 'redistricting', 'commission', 'approved', 'new', 'congressional', 'map', 'thursday', 'makes', 'modest', 'changes', 'three', 'competitive', 'districts', 'substantially', 'change', 'rest', 'states', 'lines', 'map', 'proposal', 'moves', 'democratdominated', 'legislature', 'approve', 'plan', 'reject', 'draw', 'lines', 'unclear', 'exactly', 'lawmakers', 'meet', 'vote', 'commissions', 'map', 'newyorks', 'congressional', 'redistricting', 'process', 'closely', 'watched', 'year', 'suburban', 'races', 'state', 'outsize', 'influence', 'controls', 'house', 'november', 'elections', 'ny', 'election', 'law', 'nationalizes', 'local', 'politics', 'flies', 'radar', 'despite', 'monumental', 'expert', 'redistricting', 'commission', 'tasked', 'coming', 'new', 'districts', 'states', 'highest', 'court', 'december', 'threw', 'map', 'used', '2022', 'elections', 'democrat', 'sued', 'nix', 'old', 'map', 'lost', 'handful', 'suburban', 'seats', 'series', 'bruising', 'defeats', 'helped', 'republican', 'win', 'narrow', 'house', 'majority', 'panels', 'new', 'map', 'plan', 'leaves', 'current', 'congressional', 'districts', 'largely', 'place', 'move', 'help', 'head', 'legal', 'challenges', 'proposal', 'act', 'sooth', 'least', 'concerns', 'republican', 'new', 'plan', 'leave', 'radically', 'gerrymandered', 'playing', 'field', 'fall', 'newyork', 'state', 'capitol', 'seen', 'prior', 'gov', 'kathy', 'hochul', 'delivering', 'state', 'state', 'address', 'assembly', 'chamber', 'state', 'capitol', 'tuesday', 'jan', '10', '2023', 'albany', 'ny', 'major', 'change', 'appears', 'upstate', 'district', 'currently', 'held', 'republican', 'rep', 'brandon', 'williams', 'commission', 'shift', 'district', 'situated', 'syracuse', 'include', 'cities', 'auburn', 'cortland', 'big', 'adjustments', 'neighboring', 'districts', 'held', 'republican', 'rep', 'marc', 'molinaro', 'democrat', 'rep', 'pat', 'ryan', 'plan', 'stretch', 'ryans', 'district', 'north', 'include', 'woodstock', 'molinaros', 'district', 'expand', 'include', 'sections', 'state', 'east', 'albany', 'states', 'independent', 'redistricting', 'commission', 'supposed', 'draw', 'districts', 'used', '2022', 'failed', 'reach', 'consensus', 'kicking', 'process', 'state', 'lawmakers', 'democrat', 'control', 'legislature', 'drew', 'map', 'intended', 'give', 'democrat', 'edge', 'stuffing', 'republican', 'super', 'districts', 'dilute', 'gop', 'voting', 'power', 'across', 'state', 'lawsuit', 'eventually', 'stopped', 'democrat', 'map', 'used', 'legal', 'challenge', 'delayed', 'congressional', 'primaries', 'states', 'highest', 'court', 'appointed', 'outside', 'expert', 'come', 'map', '2022', 'republican', 'performed', 'well', 'congressional', 'lines', 'flipping', 'seats', 'newyork', 'city', 'suburbs', 'winning', 'narrow', 'house', 'majority', 'defeats', 'democrat', 'sued', 'throw', '2022', 'map', 'case', 'eventually', 'reached', 'states', 'high', 'court', 'december', 'ordered', 'new', 'map', 'drawn', 'ruling', 'commission', 'another', 'chance', 'craft', 'district', 'lines', 'around', 'states', 'redistricting', 'commission', 'able', 'reach', 'consensus', 'map', 'proposal', 'approving', 'plan', 'dramatically', 'shift', 'district', 'lines', 'apparent', 'effort', 'avoid', 'another', 'legal', 'challenge', 'disrupt', 'campaigning', 'panel', 'approved', 'map', 'vote', '91', 'brief', 'hearing', 'albany', 'proposal', 'leaves', 'congressional', 'boundaries', 'long', 'island', 'races', 'expected', 'hotly', 'contested', 'mostly', 'unchanged', 'including', 'district', 'formerly', 'held', 'george', 'santos', 'expelled', 'congress', 'week', 'democrat', 'tom', 'suozzi', 'special', 'election', 'newyork', 'citys', 'lines', 'appeared', 'largely', 'unchanged', 'important', 'us', 'enter', 'process', 'confusing', 'people', 'going', 'vote', 'redistricting', 'commission', 'vice', 'chair', 'charles', 'nesbitt', 'panel', 'made', 'equal', 'number', 'republican', 'democrat']"
foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-voted-favor-95-billion-international-spending-bill-another-around-corner,"Warning about 'threat' to US has 'something to do with outer space': Chad Pergram Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has more as House Intel asks White House to declassify info on the threat on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.' Members of the House and Senate usually like to gab . But word of a cryptic, major national security threat against the U.S. cast a pall on Congress this week. Loggorrheic lawmakers suddenly turned mute when they were sworn to secrecy considering the gravity of Russia potentially deploying a weapon in outer space. ""I can’t discuss this. I’m sorry,"" lamented Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla. ""Absolutely no comment,"" said Rep. Richie Torres, D-N.Y. WARNING ABOUT 'THREAT' TO US HAS 'SOMETHING TO DO WITH OUTER SPACE': CHAD PERGRAM ""We should be concerned. It’s serious,"" offered. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., ""That’s all I can say right now."" House Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La., was practically verbose when he chatted up reporters about the threat. ""I’m going to be very precise and I’m not going to take questions,"" said Johnson. But Johnson lent little detail into the disconcerting reports. ""Steady hands are at the wheel,"" said Johnson. ""There’s no need for alarm."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, said the White House ""confirmed that, in their view, the matter was ‘serious.’"" This consternation is cast against the backdrop of the Senate approving a $95 billion international security bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. In other words, if there’s a pressing threat from Russia, this could impact Ukraine . An eye-popping 70 senators voted in favor of the bill just before daybreak Tuesday morning. Twenty-two Senate Republican voted yes. Three senators who caucus with the Democrat voted nay. HOUSE VOTE ON FOREIGN AID FUNDING IN LIMBO Twenty-two GOP yeas is not quite half of the 49 member Senate Republican Conference. But that’s still a substantial showing. And 70 vote is a robust figure from the Senate. Seventy yeas would make the bill hard to ignore in the House - under other circumstances. ""I think the House will face a moment of truth. This is a historical moment,"" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. ""You can also be sure our allies are watching, whether in NATO or East Asia, to see whether the United States surrenders, or betrays a partner."" Democrat demanded that Johnson take up the foreign aid bill. But he immediately resisted. ""We are not going to be forced into action by the Senate who in the latest product they sent us over does not have one word in the bill about America's border. Not one word about security,"" said Johnson. Even though Johnson – and Senate Republican – mauled a bipartisan Senate compromise for the border. ""What is he afraid of to put national security first to help our country, to push back and push back against Putin, and to make sure that our country is protected?"" asked House Democrat Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar , D-Calif. It’s not often that House members can bypass the leadership and deposit a bill on the floor. But there is a way to do it. The gambit is called a discharge petition. Here’s how it works: A discharge petition requires a solid number of 218 House members to sign up to go over the head of the Speaker. The number is locked in at 218, regardless of the side of the House. The House has 435 members at full population. It’s currently at 431 members. Thus, the discharge petition provision wants at least half of the body to favor sidestepping the leadership. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said he was ""absolutely"" for a discharge petition. When asked if most Democrat would sign on, Nadler replied, ""yeah, I do."" But not so fast. Many Democrat might push to advance the foreign aid package. But there are plenty of progressives who aren’t in favor of the bill at all because of concerns for Palestinians . RUSSIAN NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES IN SPACE COULD THREATEN INTERNATIONAL SATELLITES, US MILITARY COMMS: SOURCES ""I can’t support that bill with aid to Israel,"" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. ""There’s also a lot of concerns about the restrictions on the aid to Gaza that the Senate put into the bill, including suspending aid to UNRWA, which is the only agency that can deliver aid in Gaza."" Moreover, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., thought it was ""premature"" to execute a discharge petition. He wanted the House to try to work through the issue and get it on the floor another way. So certainly more Democrat favor of a discharge petition. But no one knows what might constitute that particular universe of vote. Therefore, a discharge petition certainly needs substantial GOP support. A successful discharge petition will require the support of advocates for Ukraine and moderate Republican. Someone in that wheelhouse is Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. When asked if he was open to signing a discharge petition, Bacon replied ""not now."" He added he wouldn’t ""lean too far forward"" just yet. The Nebraska Republican said ""one or two"" Democrat talked to him about signing the discharge petition. But he added a caveat. ""I'm interested in finding something we could all agree on,"" said Bacon. But that’s just the start. House GOP defense hawks Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Jen Kiggans and Don Bacon are all expressing concerns about the future of foreign aid in the House. ""I’d never sign a discharge petition when we are in the majority,"" said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., suggested that that signatories weren’t team players for the GOP. ""A discharge petition would be a betrayal on the part of anyone signing it,"" said Gaetz. This is why there have only been two successful discharge petitions in the House in the past 22 years. One was on the House’s version of the famous ""McCain-Feingold"" campaign finance law, named originally after late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisc., in 2002. The other was on a measure to renew the Export-Import Bank. So, this enterprise is challenging. And while it’s an intriguing parliamentary maneuver, the odds – and history – work against discharge petitions. The House is now out of session until February 28. The Senate is done until the week after next. Another deadline to avert a government shutdown looms on March 1. A bigger one is barreling down the tracks for March 7. And the Senate must wrestle with an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at the end of the month. In short, a resolution to the international aid bill isn’t coming soon – if ever. The threats loom – be a weapon from space for Russia. Threats at the border. Threats from China. The war in Ukraine. Instability in the Middle East. The Senate finally acted – after a months-long circumnavigation into the border talks. But there is no viable plan right now to pass the foreign aid package in the House. In this case, the Senate served the House hot coffee. And in today’s environment, it’s cooling instead in the House. Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., picks Sen. Mitt Romney or former Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman as potential running mates in a hypothetical third-party ticket on Thursday at the City Club of Cleveland breakfast forum. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he'd pick Sen. Mitt Romney , R-Utah, or former Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman as potential running mates in a hypothetical third-party presidential run. ""Hypothetically, if I was picking my running mate… really, who I would ask right now is Mitt Romney,"" Manchin said Thursday at the City Club of Cleveland breakfast forum. ""Maybe Rob Portman would be right there, too,"" Manchin added. ""Rob is a dear friend of mine. What a good man, what a good man."" MANCHIN HINTS AT POTENTIAL THIRD-PARTY RUN AFTER SUPER TUESDAY: ‘PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR OPTIONS’ From left: Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah; Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.; and former Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio. City Club CEO Dan Moulthrop moderated the forum, which had roughly 150 people in attendance, and repeatedly probed Manchin on whether he would jump in the race. ""Guys, listen, I’m not running for anything,"" Manchin said. ""I’m basically running to try to get people involved."" Manchin's comments come as he has been flirting with a third-party presidential bid in recent months, with his two-month ""listening tour"" sparking even more speculation that he will throw his hat in the ring. Both Manchin and Romney announced last year they would not seek re-election to the Senate in 2024. The West Virginia Democrat has positioned himself as a centrist politically compared to his more progressive colleagues in the Senate and has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with both Biden and former Trump. Manchin's daughter, Heather, started a nonprofit last summer called ""Americans Together,"" aiming to unite the country's moderate voter away from the ""extremes"" of the left and right. If Manchin does announce a presidential run, he'll likely use the nonprofit to bolster his campaign. ""We stand against extremism in politics. It has taken over our political system and taken away our voice,"" the Americans Together campaign website states. ""As proud Americans, we agree on more than we disagree. We demand that our politicians put country before party to get things done. Enough is enough.""

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., heads to a vote in the Senate at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 2021.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-delivers-blow-to-bidens-climate-agenda-votes-against-natural-gas-moratorium,"Biden export suspension on liquefied natural gas could spike your heat bill Fox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the Biden administration’s controversial decision to suspend exports of liquefied natural gas. The House voted Thursday afternoon in favor of stripping the Biden administration's authority to permit natural gas export projects in a blow to the president's climate agenda. In a 224-200 vote, the House approved the so-called Unlocking Domestic LNG Potential Act , with 215 Republican and nine Democrat voting in favor. Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, who chairs the House Energy Action Team, introduced the legislation on Feb. 1, arguing that it would ultimately overturn Biden's recent actions pausing permits for new liquefied natural gas export projects. ""Just last year, Biden told the Europeans that they needed to get off Russian gas and that the U.S. would supply their liquid natural gas needs. Now that it is an election year, he is reneging on that deal to appease his radical climate base,"" Pfluger told Fox News Digital ahead of the vote. ""Two-thirds of the world’s natural gas is produced in four countries: Russia, Iran, the United States and Qatar. This effective ban on U.S. LNG exports is a gift to Putin and the Iranian regime that just killed three service members with their weapons to the Houthis,"" the Texas lawmaker continued. ""I am proud to stand up for American jobs when the president seems to only stand up for the interests of Russia and Iran."" VULNERABLE DEM SENATOR FLIP-FLOPS ON SUPPLYING ENERGY TO CHINA IN MIDDLE OF RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN Rep. August Pfluger told Fox News Digital that Biden's recent actions were made to ""appease his radical climate base."" Pfluger also noted that Russian natural gas is 40% dirtier than U.S. gas, adding that Biden's recent moratorium on LNG exports is a ""horrible decision for the environment."" If enacted, Pfluger's bill would amend the Natural Gas Act of 1938, giving the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority to approve or deny applications for the siting, construction, expansion or operation of LNG export projects. And in approving or rejecting permits, FERC would be required under the bill to ""deem the importation or exportation of natural gas to be consistent with the public interest."" DOZENS OF FORMER TOP FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL ON CONGRESS TO STRIKE DOWN Biden'S NATURAL GAS CRACKDOWN ""Biden would rather appease the radical environmentalists in his party than protect hardworking Americans. House Republican will not stand idly by while the Biden administration’s Green New Deal agenda destroys American jobs, stifles American energy, and benefits our adversaries,"" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told Fox News Digital in a statement. Currently, FERC conducts a rigorous economic and environmental review of LNG export projects. However, following FERC's review, the Department of Energy is tasked with determining whether such projects, which export LNG to non-free trade agreement countries, serve the national interest and giving the final approval. Biden ordered pending natural gas export projects to be halted in a stunning move last month. The action was cheered by environmentalists who oppose fossil fuel development. Late last month, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while it conducts a rigorous environmental review as part of the agency's national interest analysis, assessing the projects' carbon emissions. That review could take more than a year to complete. Energy associations, Republican and former federal officials blasted the actions, arguing that LNG exports are critical for maintaining low energy prices in the U.S., helping American allies to wean off Russian gas and decreasing global carbon emissions. They have noted that, in December 2023, more than 87% of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe, U.K. or Asian markets previously reliant on Russia. STATE AGS WARN Biden'S NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW, DEMAND REVERSAL ""Allies and trading partners around the world rely on clean, reliable, and affordable U.S. natural gas for energy and economic security, and to advance environmental progress through emission reductions,"" said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute, which endorsed the Unlocking Domestic LNG Potential Act. ""With Europe still relying on Russia for nearly 15% of its natural gas consumption, and global demand expected to increase for several decades, continued expansion of U.S. export capacity is essential to American interests,"" Durbin added. Rep. Frank Pallone said the Unlocking Domestic LNG Potential Act would benefit China. However, a small fraction of U.S. LNG exports are sent to the Chinese market. But environmental activist groups and Democrat have criticized the legislation, arguing that stripping DOE of its authority to permit LNG exports would exacerbate climate change and mainly benefit Chinese industry. ""Make no mistake: if this bill ever became law, Americans would pay more for the gas that heats their homes and keeps their lights on. LNG exports are shipped to China. The vast majority of exports are sent to Europe, which has relied on U.S. natural gas to wean itself off Russian energy amid the Ukraine war, and other Asian countries like Japan and South Korea. The legislation now makes its way to the Senate, where Sen. Tim Scott , R-S.C., Banking Committee ranking member, introduced companion legislation alongside 16 fellow Republican. The White House, however, said Biden would veto the bill if it was passed. ""The Administration believes that the critical protections current law provides, which this legislation would repeal, should be retained to protect residential and industrial consumers and national and domestic energy security,"" the White House said Tuesday","['biden', 'export', 'suspension', 'liquefied', 'natural', 'gas', 'spike', 'heat', 'bill', 'congressional', 'correspondent', 'chad',

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday reaffirmed NATO's mission to defend ""every inch"" of territory of its members as Russia continues to pose a threat despite being bogged down in a war with Ukraine. The remarks came as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels to discuss a range of issues, including Moscow's invasion and how to further strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defense. ""The United States will continue to stand with our NATO allies and to defend the sovereignty and the territory of every alliance member — every inch of it, as Biden has repeatedly made clear. Our commitment to Article Five remains ironclad,"" Austin said in a statement. NATO ALLIANCE TO EXCLUDE UKRAINE FROM UPCOMING SUMMER SUMMIT, US AMBASSADOR SAYS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin reaffirmed the Biden administration's commitment to NATO on Thursday. Article Five refers to the notion that an attack on a NATO member is considered an attack on all members. Defense spending among the 31 NATO member states has been a point of contention. Each nation has pledged to spend 2% of its GDP on defense. In 2014, only three successfully hit that target. This year, 18 are expected to, said NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. ""Since the Investment Pledge was made in 2014, European Allies and Canada have added more than $600 billion US dollars for defense,"" he said Wednesday. ""So we are making real progress."" THE ANTI-US AXIS OF CYBER CHAOS OF RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAN AND NORTH KOREA IS UNDERWAY AND Biden NEEDS TO ACT The Pentagon building in Arlington, Va. Former Trump has railed against NATO members for not contributing their fair share to military spending and, instead, relying on the U.S. for assistance.

Tom Cotton: We need to convince China we can get on offense Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., says foreign adversaries are not deterred under Biden on 'The Story.' FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Tom Cotton , R-Ark., is urging the Department of Defense to share information about the agency's contract with a Chinese-owned financial corporation that provides tutoring services for U.S. military families. On Thursday, Cotton sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin calling the business relationship with Hong Kong-based Primavera Capital Group ""ill advised, reckless,"" and a danger to U.S. national security. Primavera, the capital group associated with TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, owns the tutoring service Tutor.com and has provided critical funding to the TikTok giant. Biden CAMP WEIGHS JOINING TIKTOK TO SWAY YOUNG VOTERS MONTHS AFTER PURGING APP FROM FEDERAL DEVICES: REPORT Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., is urging the DOD to re-examine their contract with a Chinese-owned financial corporation that provides tutoring for U.S. military families. ""We should not be giving the Chinese communists access to the data of United States servicemembers and their families,"" Cotton, a member of the Senate's intelligence committee, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""I look forward to a full explanation from the Department of Defense on their continued use of Tutor.com ."" Like ByteDance and any other Chinese tech company, Primavera is subject to Chinese national security laws which require tech companies to release confidential business and customer data. Primavera acquired Tutor.com in January 2022. ""While providing educational services, Tutor.com collects personal data on users, such as location, internet protocol addresses, and contents of the tutoring sessions,"" Cotton wrote. ""As Chinese national security laws require companies to release confidential business and customer data to the Chinese government, we are paying to expose our military and their children’s private information to the Chinese Communist Party.""

By next week, Cotton is urging the DOD to provide information regarding whether they participated in any security reviews concerning Primavera's acquisition before its approval, and if so, whether any concerns were raised during this process. Additionally, Cotton wants statistics on the annual usage of Tutor.com by military personnel or their dependents, and whether users are informed that their data may be shared with a Chinese company.

Biden attacked Special Counsel Robert Hur for bringing up his son's death, but it was Biden who first brought up the death of Beau in an interview, Fox News can confirm. Biden brought up Beau’s death, not Hur, during his October interview, according to two well-placed sources familiar with the probe. The revelations came after Biden lashed out last Thursday at Hur, who investigated his handling of classified documents, after the prosecutor in his final report noted that the president struggled to remember details such as when his son died. Special Counsel Robert Hur's report on his probe into Biden's handling of classified documents noted that the president has ""poor memory."" NEW POLL REVEALS THE TOP 2 ISSUES AFFECTING VOTER CONFIDENCE IN Biden While Hur's report absolved Biden of criminal wrongdoing relating to his handling of classified documents , it characterized the president as an ""elderly man with a poor memory."" This image from Special Council Robert Hur’s investigation released by the Department of Justice on Thursday, February 8, 2024 shows Biden inside his Virginia home office in October 2017. The report, released last Thursday, described the president’s memory as ""hazy,"" ""fuzzy,"" ""faulty,"" ""poor,"" and suggested Biden did not remember when his son Beau Biden died. WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN COMPLAINS ABOUT MEDIA COVERAGE OF Biden'S COGNITIVE ABILITY: ‘STRIKING INACCURACIES’ ""How in the h--- dare he raise that,"" Biden said in a press conference on Thursday. ""Frankly, when I was asked the question I thought to myself it wasn’t any of their d--- business."" Biden held a press conference on Thursday in response to Special Counsel Robert Hur's description of his age and memory.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vances-office-doubles-down-on-impeachment-time-bomb-foreign-aid-package,"Foreign aid package comes as Ukraine war enters third year of fighting Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin breaks down the $95 billion foreign aid package approved by the Senate. FIRST ON FOX: Sen. JD Vance's office will send a letter to GOP lawmakers Thursday doubling down on the claim that the Ukraine-Israel-Taiwan foreign aid package contains an ""impeachment time bomb"" that would tie the hands of the next administration. Vance's memo comes a day after former Vice President Mike Pence' s policy think tank, Advancing American Freedom, sent a memo to senators dismissing Vance's claims. The national security supplemental text assures the delivery of $1.6 billion to finance Ukraine's military as well as just under $14 billion for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative through Sept. 30, 2025 – the same aid mechanism that Trump temporarily paused while pushing for an investigation into Biden family foreign business dealings. MIKE PENCE'S THINK TANK PUSHES BACK ON JD VANCE'S 'IMPEACHMENT TIME BOMB' CLAIM IN FOREIGN AID PACKAGE Republican candidate for U.S. Senate JD Vance speaks at a campaign rally at the Dayton International Airport on November 7, 2022 in Vandalia, Ohio. AAF claimed Wednesday that it's the president’s duty to faithfully execute the law as ""written into the Constitution"" — known as the Take Care clause — rejecting the argument made by the Nixon administration that the clause ""empowered the President to ignore federal statutes."" Vance's office said AAF was actually supporting their point that the Ukraine supplemental would tie Trump's hands if he returns to the White House. ""Therefore, they advance the claim that a future president would have a constitutional responsibility to 'faithfully execute the law' that requires him to fund Ukraine well into his second term or face a claim of a constitutional/legal violation,"" Vance's office wrote in the new memo. ""That is exactly the claim advanced by the Ukraine Supplemental Impeachment Time Bomb."" ""Administration officials have been transparent about efforts to tie the hands of a future presidential administration, with one revealing to the Washington Post that this supplemental bill is a key component of their plan to ‘future-proof aid for Ukraine against the possibility that former president Trump wins his reelection bid,’"" the memo continued. ""Former senior administration officials, including a former director of the Office of Management and Budget, have validated that this supplemental bill may function as a ""secret set of handcuffs"" and that opponents of a future president’s Ukraine policy 'will use this to try and tie his hands in the initial weeks of his presidency.'"" SENATOR PAUL ASSERTS UKRAINE AID PACKAGE WOULD 'TIE THE HANDS' OF FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS Former Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the Republican Party Of Iowa's annual Lincoln Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, US, on Friday, July 28, 2023. Meanwhile, AAF noted in their memo if the president wants to cut off federal aid to Ukraine, he must get approval from Congress in a 45-day timeframe, ""otherwise he must dutifully execute the law as written."" Vance's office said that rebuttal actually ""reinforces"" their position ""that this supplemental would tie a future president’s hands on spending in Ukraine or he would risk impeachment from Democrat on the same absurd grounds as Trump’s first impeachment."" The Trump administration, through the Office of Management and Budget, withheld a total of about $400 million in security assistance from Ukraine in 2019. This came just before Trump asked Ukrainian President Voldomyr Zelenskyy to investigate the family of his 2020 rival, Biden, and while the White House allegedly was withholding an Oval Office visit from Zelenskyy in exchange for an investigation. These actions are what fueled the impeachment effort against Trump, in which he was ultimately acquitted. Vance's memo argues previous Ukraine supplemental bills lacked sunset dates extending into future administrations. The Biden administration requested specific sunset dates in the current bill to extend aid into the next presidential term, which was granted despite most Senate Republican voting against it. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Marc Short, AAF board chairman said ""AAF will side with the Constitution on the powers given to Congress and the Executive Branch over Senator Vance's conspiracies any day."" SEN. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said the provision in the bill ""is gonna force him to send money and spend money for Ukraine."" ""This is in the bill,"" Tuberville told Fox News Digital. ""So, it's just another situation where the Democrat are doing something and working towards making sure that money's spent in a certain area where American taxpayers and this country don't have."" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, also agreed with Vance and claimed that Democrat are ""setting up"" for a possible Trump presidential win","['foreign', 'aid', 'package', 'comes', 'ukraine', 'war', 'enters', 'third',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-judge-and-fury,"Welcome to Fox News’ Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail. What's Happening? - Fulton County DA Fani Willis shocks in raucous courtroom testimony - Date set for first Trump criminal trial - Nearly half of Americans think Biden should be replaced as Dem nominee Fulton County DA Fani Willis Embattled Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis took the stand to testify against allegations she had an ""improper"" affair with special prosecutor Nathan Wade , which could derail her case against former Trump. Willis was notably agitated and at points raised her voice during a raucous several hours of testimony. At one point, Willis held up a printed copy the allegations against her in both hands and turned to the judge yelling, ""it is a lie!"" Willis also called defense attorney Ashleigh Merchan's interests ""contrary to democracy."" Judge Scott McAfee presiding over the proceeding, called for a five-minute recess at one point. When court was back in session he told lawyers to stop ""talking over each other"" and cautioned Willis, saying: ""We have to listen to the questions as asked. And if this happens again and again, I'm going to have no choice but to strike your testimony."" Willis is expected back on the stand Friday for further testimony. Trump had his own courtroom drama Thursday. He appeared in a Manhattan court for a pretrial hearing in the criminal ""hush-money"" case against him, where the judge set a date for the beginning of the first trial on criminal charges. The trial is set to start March 25, a few weeks after Super Tuesday but before the end of the GOP primary. Trump said he would be campaigning in the evening after attending the trial.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-win-seat-republicans-win-impeachment-two-presidents-clash-over-nato,"Dems flipping NY House seat threatens GOP majority Fox News’ Bryan Llenas reports on Democrat Tom Suozzi's victory in the NewYork special election to fill former Rep. George Santos’ seat. If the second attempt to impeach the Homeland Security chief had taken place a short time later, the Republican would have failed again. Instead, they managed to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas–the first sitting Cabinet secretary to draw that sanction–by a single vote. But after a victory in George Santos’ old district, the Democrat would have had the extra vote to stop the impeachment. Trump NATO COMMENTS TRIGGER FIERCE MEDIA AND EUROPEAN OPPOSITION: HOW SERIOUS IS HE? Tom Suozzi beat Republican Mazi Pilip in Tuesday’s special election on Long Island, unleashing a tidal wave of punditry about his winning formula–openly tackling such issues as illegal migration and crime rather than avoiding them. I always caution against drawing sweeping conclusions in one-off local races, and this election in a snowstorm is no exception. Former U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi, Democrat candidate for NewYork's 3rd congressional district, speaks at his election night party Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2024, in Woodbury, N.Y. The underlying factor was Santos, the outlandish, lying, fabricating lawmaker who won the seat with a made-up resume, was expelled by the House and is under indictment. Voters felt hosed by the Republican publicity hound, and maybe the Dems were more motivated to vote. Sure, Suozzi deserves credit for seizing on illegal migration and crime rather than avoiding such explosive issues – and doggedly distancing himself from Biden. But he also has to run again in the fall. NATO CHIEF SAYS Trump CRITICISM 'DOES UNDERMINE THE SECURITY OF ALL OF US' Trump, for his part, blamed Pilip, ""running in a race where she didn’t endorse me and tried to ‘straddle the fence,’ when she would have easily WON if she understood anything about MODERN DAY politics in America…I STAYED OUT OF THE RACE, ‘I WANT TO BE LOVED!’"" A subtle Valentine’s Day message? Republican presidential hopeful and former US Trump looks on, flanked by son Eric Trump and daughter-in-law Lara Trump, during an Election Night Party in Nashua, New Hampshire, on January 23, 2024. Trump won the key New Hampshire primary Tuesday, moving him ever closer to locking in the Republican presidential nomination and securing an extraordinary White House rematch with Biden.) The move against Mayorkas, the first against a Cabinet officer in 150 years, is about the politics of symbolism. Republican know full well the Democrat-controlled Senate is not going to convict him. This was about keeping the spotlight on one of the GOP’s best issues . But if the press saddled Johnson with a humiliating defeat last week, it has to credit him with a big win now. Both episodes shed light on the fractious politics of the Hill. Just when it looked like the Senate might pass a bipartisan border security bill–which included military aid to Ukraine and Israel–Trump ripped it and the package was dead. YOU DON'T NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM TO SECURE THE BORDER: MARC THIESSEN Now the Senate appears ready to pass a stand-alone military aid bill by a filibuster-proof majority. But Johnson says he won’t bring it up for a House floor vote. That would bury it, unless a handful of Republican join with Democrat to force a vote through a discharge petition. Think about it: the United States, unable to help two major allies because of election-year politics, especially Ukraine, which remains under siege by Vladimir Putin. And that’s why Biden took the rare step of delivering a televised speech on Tuesday. His predecessor gave him an opening by saying he wouldn’t protect any NATO member who didn’t pay its fair share in military costs. And if that were the case, Putin and Russia could ""do whatever the hell they want."" WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 13: U.S. Biden speaks on the Senate's recent passage of the National Security Supplemental Bill, which provides military aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 13, 2024, in Washington, DC. During his remarks Biden urged House Republican and U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to move the legislation through the House of Representatives. Biden, in his speech , accused Trump of siding with the Russian dictator, calling the comments ""dumb,"" ""shameful,"" ""dangerous"" and ""un-American."" Put aside whether Biden is right or Trump is trying to pressure delinquent allies. Biden passed up a softball Super Bowl interview. So why is he getting in front of the cameras now? One, he’s trying to get push Congress to pass the military aid bill. Two, he’s trying to change the subject from his own questionable memory in that wake of that stinging special counsel’s report. Three, he is finally heeding the advice of those who say he needs to do more television to prove his competence and dim the focus on every gaffe or misstatement. What’s fascinating is the spin of each party when it comes to backing their candidate. Democrat are hitting the airwaves saying Biden is sharp and laser-focused in private, and counsel Robert Hur has no business airing his personal criticism of the president’s mental acuity. And everyone is getting sustained exposure to a system that generally favors political maneuvering over actual results.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/russia-nuclear-space-weapon-intelligence/index.html,"Russia is trying to develop a nuclear space weapon that would destroy satellites by creating a massive energy wave when detonated, potentially crippling a vast swath of the commercial and government satellites that the world below depends on to talk on cell phones, pay bills, and surf the internet, according to three sources familiar with the intelligence. These sources gave CNN a more detailed understanding of what Russia is working on – and the threat it could pose – than the US government has previously disclosed . Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, set off a frenzy in Washington on Wednesday when he issued a statement saying his panel “had information concerning a serious national security threat.” By Friday, Biden had publicly confirmed that Turner was referring to a new Russian nuclear anti-satellite capability — but officials have steadfastly refused to discuss it further, citing the highly classified nature of the intelligence. The weapon is still under development and is not yet in orbit, Biden administration officials have emphasized publicly. But if used, officials say, it would cross a dangerous rubicon in the history of nuclear weapons and could cause extreme disruptions to everyday life in ways that are difficult to predict. This kind of new weapon — known generally by military space experts as a nuclear EMP — would create a pulse of electromagnetic energy and a flood of highly charged particles that would tear through space to disrupt other satellites winging around Earth. Biden on Friday emphasized publicly that there is “no nuclear threat to the people of America or anywhere else in the world with what Russia is doing at the moment.” “Anything that they’re doing and/or they will do relates to satellites and space and damaging those satellites, potentially,” he said. The Defense Department and the intelligence community have tracked Russian efforts to develop a broad range of anti-satellite weapons, including an EMP, for years. And there has been a stream of intelligence reporting in recent months related specifically to Russia’s efforts to develop nuclear-powered anti-satellite capabilities, according to one defense official. But Russia has recently made progress in its efforts to develop a nuclear EMP — a related but far more alarming technology. “Our general knowledge of Russian pursuit of this kind of capability goes back many, many months, if not a few years,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. “But only in recent weeks now has the intelligence community been able to assess with a higher sense of confidence exactly how Russia continues to pursue it.” The intelligence community, Biden said, had “found out there was a capacity to launch a system into space that could theoretically do something that was damaging” but that it “hadn’t happened yet.” “It’s not a new concept and, as a concept, dates back to the late Cold War,” said one US official. But, they said, “the big fear with any eventual EMP device in orbit [is] it might render large portions of particular orbits unusable” by creating a minefield of disabled satellites that “would then prove dangerous to any new satellites we might try to put up to replace or repair the existing satellites.” The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Defense Department and the National Security Council all declined to comment. It was not immediately clear whether the device as designed could impact GPS and nuclear command and control satellites, which operate in a higher orbit than the vast constellation of commercial and government satellites whizzing through low-Earth orbit. Those larger satellites are designed to be impregnable to a nuclear blast, but a former top space official at the Pentagon told CNN that “they could be vulnerable” depending on how close they were to the EMP, how old they are and how big the blast. ‘Last-ditch weapon’ Experts say this kind of weapon could have the potential to wipe out mega constellations of small satellites, like SpaceX’s Starlink, which has been successfully used by Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia. This would almost certainly be “a last-ditch weapon” for Russia, the US official and other sources said — because it would do the same damage to whatever Russian satellites were also in the area. It also remains unclear how well-developed the technology is. Russia has had a number of public debacles with their nuclear technology in recent years. In 2019, seven Russians were killed in a nuclear accident that occurred while Moscow was trying to recover a nuclear-powered cruise missile that had crashed into the White Sea during a failed test. Still, a recent intelligence assessment on Russian progress so alarmed some lawmakers on Capitol Hill that Turner issued an invitation to all members of the House to be read in on the matter. Shortly thereafter, he issued the vague public statement that forced the issue into the public eye. Several sources familiar with the matter said that the exposure of the intelligence was extremely damaging because the source was incredibly sensitive. According to those sources, the intelligence community is now scrambling to figure out how to preserve its access. Biden administration officials contend that if Russia were to field a nuclear EMP, it would be the first-ever violation of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which bans stationing weapons of mass destruction in outer space. “It would be a violation of the Outer Space Treaty to which more than 130 countries have signed up to, including Russia,” Kirby said Thursday, without providing details. Russia has withdrawn from several arms control treaties in recent years, leaving the post-Cold War arms control architecture all but gutted.","['russia', 'trying', 'develop', 'nuclear', 'space',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/takeaways-fani-willis-testimony-georgia/index.html,"The Georgia election subversion case against Trump and 14 of his allies took a stunning turn Thursday when two top prosecutors testified under oath about their romantic relationship at a hearing triggered by allegations of self-dealing that have the potential to derail the indictment. The all-day hearing escalated steadily throughout the day, culminating with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis taking the witness stand for a combative brawl with defense attorneys that drew several rebukes from the judge. Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. Trump arrives on stage for a Get Out The Vote rally at the North Charleston Convention Center on February 14, 2024 in North Charleston, SouthCarolina. Win McNamee/Getty Images Related article Trump team facing a new conundrum: How to stay on the trail during a weekslong criminal trial Judge Scott McAfee convened the hearing after some of Trump co-defendants surfaced allegations of a relationship between Willis and Nathan Wade, whom she hired in 2021 to join the prosecution team. Trump and his co-defendants want the judge to disqualify Willis’ team from the case – or throw out the charges – because of a possible conflict-of-interest. There was talk of cash exchanging hands from Willis to Wade, where they store their money at home, CashApp usage, and their spending habits – all to get to the question of whether Willis benefitted financially from putting him on her staff. Willis was expected to return Friday to be be cross-examined by district attorney lawyer Anna Cross, but Cross said at the beginning of Friday’s hearing that she did not have any additional questions . The judge said he does not plan to issue a ruling on Friday. Here are takeaways from the hearing that was at times jaw-dropping, awkward and strikingly personal. Willis’ defiant afternoon on the stand What unfolded on Thursday is extremely rare in American courtrooms. The district attorney who has charged Trump with racketeering went under oath to defend her ethics and answer personal questions about her relationship with Wade. The risks could not be greater, and Willis’ credibility is on the line. Video Ad Feedback Erin Burnett on Fani Willis testimony: She tore into Trump's team 01:33 - Source: CNN Things quickly went off the rails. Willis didn’t act much like a traditional witness and was more like a prosecutor, arguing with the defense attorneys, raising objections, making legal arguments and even having exchanges with the judge. She even raised her voice at one point. This led to a few rebukes from McAfee, who urged her and other attorneys in the courtroom to maintain “professionalism” and to not “talk over each other.” Willis repeatedly accused some of the defense attorneys of peddling lies – before and after the judge’s admonishment. “You’ve lied in this. … I think you lied right here,” Willis said to attorney Ashleigh Merchant, pointing to copies of filings that raised accusations of self-dealing and nepotism. ‘I’m not on trial,’ Willis says Willis seized several opportunities to defend herself. The district attorney had fought efforts to make her appear, both in Wade’s ongoing divorce proceedings and in the hearing on Thursday, up until the moment she came into the room to take the stand. She said at the beginning of her testimony that she was “very anxious” to defend herself, “so I ran to the courtroom.” “You think I’m on trial,” Willis said, in her sharpest pushback of the day. “These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020,” she added, pointing toward the table of attorneys representing defendants in the criminal case. “I’m not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.” She later slammed the defense attorneys, calling them “confused” and “intrusive.” “Ms. Merchant’s interests are contrary to democracy, not to mine,” Willis said, attacking the attorney for Trump campaign attorney Michael Roman, who is accused of playing a leading role in the multi-state “fake electors” plot to subvert the Electoral College. When did the relationship start? On the stand, Wade stuck to his earlier claim – in a sworn affidavit submitted to the court – that his romantic relationship with Willis began in early 2022 and that they split travel and vacation expenses. But Robin Bryant-Yeartie, a former friend of Willis and Fulton County employee, contradicted that claim, testifying that she had “no doubt” that the Willis-Wade affair began in late 2019. Notably, that would be before Willis hired Wade to lead the Trump probe in late 2021. Bryant-Yeartie said she observed “hugging, kissing, close affection” between Willis and Wade prior to 2022, when they claimed their romantic relationship began. She also testified that Willis had told her in 2020 and 2021 that she was dating Wade. There was some Clinton-esque parsing of words on whether Wade cheated on his ex-wife by being with Willis. Past filings from Roman’s team salaciously noted that she had been dating “a married man.” Wade testified that his previous marriage was broken since 2015, long before his relationship with Willis began, saying, “My marriage was irretrievably broken” in 2015, and “I was free to have a relationship.” Wade and Willis describe using cash for reimbursements Wade and Willis have offered a simple explanation for why there’s essentially no paper trail to back up his claims they split expenses: Willis used cash. Credit card statements submitted in Wade’s divorce proceedings show he paid for two flights for them in recent years, to San Francisco and Miami. They also took lavish trips to Belize, the Bahamas and some Caribbean cruises. When pressed on whether he paid for Willis’ travel when they vacationed together, Wade said that Willis reimbursed him for a flight “in cash.” Wade said he did not have receipts for all of the times Willis reimbursed him for trips – pushing back against the allegations from the defense side that Willis was essentially getting kickbacks from him in the form of vacations. “I did not deposit the cash in my account,” Wade replied, smirking at times. Defense attorney Craig Gillen, who represents one of the fake electors, grilled Wade on what he would do with the cash reimbursements – in at least one case, thousands of dollars. “You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash?” Gillen shot back, raising his voice slightly. “No sir,” Wade said, to which Gillen replied: “Not a single solitary one?” “Not a one,” Wade responded. Willis: ‘I don’t need anybody to foot my bills’ There was also a dispute over when the relationship ended, and whether it had any impact on the decision to seek the massive RICO indictment against Trump and others in last August. Both said the relationship ended in summer 2023. Willis implied that the physical component ended earlier in the summer, but that the two had a “tough conversation” that fully ended things afterward. Trump lawyer Steven Sadow asked Willis about the breakup, eliciting an answer that revealed sexist remarks that Wade allegedly made to Willis in the past. She said, he “is used to women that, as he told me one time, ‘the only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich.’” She explained that this was a part of their breakup – but it also was a defense to the self-dealing claims against her. “We would have brutal arguments about the fact that ‘I am your equal,’” Willis said. “I don’t need anything from a man – a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back.” Willis added, “I don’t need anybody to foot my bills.” Earlier, Sadow asked Wade during his own testimony whether the two had any “personal relationship at all” since their relationship ended, saying “and you know what I mean by that.” Wade shot back, asking if Sadow meant “if I had intercourse with the district attorney.” “We’re very good friends, probably closer than ever because of these attacks,” Wade said. “But if you’re asking me about specific intercourse, the answer is no.” Huge distraction from the charges against Trump – for now Nothing that happened Thursday undercut the factual allegations against Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, or the other GOP allies who are accused of trying to overturn the 2020 election. But the hearing shifted the conversation away from those allegation and away from Trump legal woes for now. Earlier in the day, a NewYork judge set the trial date for Trump historic first trial, in the hush-money criminal case, for March 25. But by the afternoon, that news was nearly washed away by the jaw-dropping testimony taking place in Atlanta and being beamed across the country on national television. Friday, a separate NewYork judge is expected to issue his decision in the Trump civil fraud case that’s an existential threat to his business. State prosecutors want that judge to issue a $370 million fine against Trump, after finding that Trump and his company committed significant fraud against banks and insurers by lying about his net worth and assets. They also want Trump barred from doing business in NewYork.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/biden-east-palestine-visit/index.html,"The Norfolk Southern train derailment that sent toxins into the soil, water and air of East Palestine, Ohio, was an “act of greed,” Biden said Friday as he visited the town for the first time. Describing the crash as “an act of cruelty that was 100% preventable,” Biden said the administration had been pushing railroad companies to take more precautions prior to the February 3, 2023, Norfolk Southern derailment. “Multibillion dollar railroad companies transporting toxic chemical have a responsibility to do it safely,” Biden said Friday. Norfolk Southern, he said, “failed.” “While there are acts of God,” Biden said, “this was an act of greed.” While nobody was killed in the Norfolk Southern crash, the train’s derailment and the later decision to vent and burn five tankers containing cancer-causing vinyl chloride created a plume of toxic smoke that could be seen from space and caused a panic over the quality of the town’s drinking water. More than 1 million pounds of toxins were put into the town’s water, air and soil as a result of the derailment and its aftermath. Hundreds of residents were ordered to evacuate. Some moved away permanently. Others said they had developed rashes, sore throats, nausea and headaches after eventually returning to their homes, and worried the symptoms were related to chemicals released after the derailment. Biden had been under pressure to visit East Palestine since the derailment. The White House said shortly after the train’s derailment that the president would find a time to visit, but that did not happen last year. Trump visited East Palestine about three weeks after the derailment on February 22, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg visited the next day . Trump during his visit criticized Biden absence and what resulted was a political uproar, all while residents said they simply wanted to know whether their water was safe to drink. In the town on Friday, both Biden and Environmental Protection Administration Administrator Michael Regan sought to reassure residents that the administration’s focus was on helping clean the town up and hold Norfolk Southern accountable from the crash since the outset - including Biden signing of an executive order in September ordering federal agencies to hold the company responsible for cleaning up the mess and reporting progress. The company reported last summer that costs associated with the cleanup were around $1 billion. While visiting with East Palestine residents, Biden drank local tap water and sipped on coffee that was brewed with the tap water and local beans, according to the traveling press pool. He also announced his administration was awarding six National Institutes of Health grants to research the short- and long-term effects of the derailment. Biden visit comes at the invitation of East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway and other community leaders, according to the White House. Conaway has been critical of Biden failure to visit East Palestine sooner, telling Fox News last month: “My personal opinion is the best time for him to come would be February of 2025, when he is on his book tour.” Speaking after Biden and Regan, Conaway on Friday said the president’s visit was “long awaited.” East Palestine, Conaway said, will “not be defined by this single event – rather our response to it and our perseverance.” “Biden, your long-awaited visit to our village today allows us to focus on the things we agree with, acknowledge this disaster should never happen, address the long-term health concerns and the economic growth of the village and ensure this never happens again to another community,” Conaway said. The White House said the president would visit East Palestine to “meet with residents impacted by the Norfolk Southern train derailment and assess the progress that his Administration has helped deliver in coordination with state and local leaders to protect the community and hold Norfolk Southern accountable.” “He also has heard loud and clear from the folks in East Palestine that they don’t want to be defined by an event,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier this week. “And so, he’ll speak to the administration’s work to deliver on the needs for family businesses that are affected.” Biden echoed that message on Friday, promising his administration would stick with its efforts to help the town recover. “It doesn’t matter if you’re Democrat or Republican or independent. What matters is we’re all Americans, everyone, everyone, we look out for one another. We leave no one behind and we come back stronger than before. That’s what you’re doing here. That’s what’s happening right here in this community,” Biden said. “A vast majority has been done. But we’re gonna stay to the very end until every deed is met.” Buttigieg said last month efforts to address rail safety have been stymied by Republican in Congress. “Almost one year after the Norfolk Southern derailment, Congress has still not passed the bipartisan Railway Safety Act,” he said. “It should not be the case that one year after that derailment, we are still waiting for Congress to act, and yet we have seen many who had a lot to say about this in Congress a year ago still not make clear on the record whether they are for or against this bill, and we’ve seen some House Republican who have now voted twice to pass legislation that would cut railroad safety fund funding and track inspections.” But Buttigieg previously acknowledged some mistakes in his own response, saying he should have visited East Palestine sooner and that he failed to anticipate the political fallout from the derailment. The Environmental Protection Agency has overseen the removal of more than 174,000 tons of contaminated soil from the site, but questions about whether toxins still lurk remain. Regan told reporters last month that his agency was confident “the residents of East Palestine are not at risk from impacted surface water, soil or air from the derailment.” This story has been

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/gaetz-ex-girlfriend-subpoenaed-house-ethics-committee/index.html,"The House Ethics Committee investigating Rep. Matt Gaetz has subpoenaed his ex-girlfriend who was a key witness in the federal investigation into the Florida lawmaker, according to her lawyer Tim Jansen. She is scheduled to testify, via a video call, on February 29, and Jansen said she will invoke the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The woman, a former Capitol Hill staffer, has been linked to Gaetz as far back as the summer of 2017 . Investigators were interested in that time frame because that is when the congressman is accused of having sexual contact with another woman, who was 17 years old at the time. CNN has reached out to Gaetz for comment on the subpoena, which was f irst reported by ABC News. A spokesperson for the House Ethics Committee declined to comment on the matter.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/takeaways-donald-trump-fraud-ruling/index.html,"Judge Arthur Engoron hit Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties. Combined with the $83 million judgment issued against Trump for defaming E. Jean Carroll, that means Trump has been fined roughly $438 million over the past four weeks. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 11: Former U.S. Trump sits in NewYork State SupremeCourt during his civil fraud trial on January 11, 2024 in NewYork City. Trump won't make his own closing arguments after his lawyers objected to  Judge Arthur Engoron insistence that Trump stay within the bounds of ""relevant, material facts that are in evidence"" of the case. Trump faces a permanent ban from running a business in NewYork state and $370 million in penalties in the case brought by state Attorney General Letitia James. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/File Related live-story Judge orders Trump to pay nearly $355 million in civil fraud trial Friday’s ruling underscored how the civil cases against Trump are still significantly damaging to the former president, endangering his business empire even as he faces four criminal trials, the first of which is set to begin next month. Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in NewYork for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again. “Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants. Here’s what to know from the decision: Engoron’s fines are the biggest yet against Trump The fines Engoron levied in his ruling against Trump – known as “disgorgement,” or the return of ill-gotten gains – are higher in terms of magnitude than any previous fine levied against the former president and his company. NewYork Attorney General Letitia James had asked Engoron to fine Trump and other defendants $370 million, accusing them of engaging in a long-running fraud scheme of inflating Trump assets on his financial statements. It came pretty close. Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. Judge Engoron and former Trump. Pool Related article READ: Ruling ordering Trump and his companies to pay nearly $355M in NewYork civil fraud case Engoron ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, a contract the judge says “was obtained through the use of false SFC.” And the judge ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments, which could potentially add as much as $100 million to the total he’s ultimately required to pay. In addition, Trump was barred from serving as an officer or director of any NewYork corporation or other legal entity in NewYork for a period of three years. Engoron gets the last word, and then some Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. “Defendants’ refusal to admit error – indeed, to continue it, according to the Independent Monitor – constrains this Court to conclude that they will engage in it going forward unless judicially restrained,” Engoron wrote. Engoron acknowledged that the sins Trump committed – which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump company – were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. “This is a venial sin, not a mortal sin. Defendants did not commit murder or arson. They did not rob a bank at gunpoint. Trump is not Bernard Madoff. Yet, defendants are incapable of admitting the error of their ways. Instead, they adopt a ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil’ posture that the evidence belies,” the judge wrote. Engoron even turned to poetry to make his point: “The English poet Alexander Pope first declared, ‘To err is human, to forgive is divine.’ Defendants apparently are of a different mind.” Engoron was critical of Trump testimony on the stand, when the former president mostly ignored questions and took the opportunity instead to give political speeches attacking the case, the attorney general and the judge. At first, Engoron tried to rein Trump in – even threatening to remove him as a witness at one point – but he eventually gave up and let Trump rant in response to the questions from the attorney general’s lawyer. “Overall, Trump rarely responded to the questions asked, and he frequently interjected long, irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond the scope of the trial,” Engoron wrote. “His refusal to answer the questions directly, or in some cases, at all, severely compromised his credibility.” No corporate death penalty as judge backs off dissolving Trump Org. Believe it or not, it could have been worse for Trump. The judge banned him from serving as an officer or director of a NewYork corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. In September, Engoron issued a summary judgment dissolving Trump business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But he pulled back from that decision – which had been put on hold pending appeal – on Friday, writing that he no longer felt it was necessary because he was putting in place two different independent monitors to oversee the company going forward. The independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years, Engoron ruled. In addition, he ordered an independent director of compliance should be installed at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense. “As going forward there will be two-tiered oversight, an Independent Monitor and an Independent Director of Compliance, of the major activities that could lead to fraud, cancellation of the business licenses is no longer necessary,” Engoron wrote. Trump former lawyer and fixer ‘told the truth’ Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen. “Although the animosity between the witness and the defendant is palpable, providing Cohen with an incentive to lie, the Court found his testimony credible, based on the relaxed manner in which he testified, the general plausibility of his statements, and, most importantly, the way his testimony was corroborated by other trial evidence,” Engoron wrote. Engoron pushed back on Trump narrative that Cohen was a star witness for the attorney general on whose credibility the case could teeter. “Michael Cohen was an important witness on behalf of the plaintiff, although hardly the linchpin that defendants have attempted to portray him to be,” Engoron said. While the testimony from Trump former fixer was compromised by his previous perjury plea in another case and some “seeming contradictions” in what he said at this trial, the judge said he believed Cohen when he testified that “Trump did not expressly direct him to reverse engineer financial statements, he ordered him to do so indirectly, in his ‘mob voice.’” “A less-forgiving factfinder might have concluded differently, might not have believed a single word of a convicted perjurer,” Engoron also wrote. “This factfinder does not believe that pleading guilty to perjury means that you can never tell the truth. Michael Cohen told the truth.” Trump adult sons banned for 2 years Trump eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in NewYork for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company that also hasn’t filled the chief financial officer or controller positions vacated by former Trump Org. execs Allen Weisselberg and Jeff McConney. During closing arguments last month, Engoron questioned whether the attorney general presented any evidence that Trump eldest sons knew that there was fraud going on at the company — but ultimately found them liable for issuing false financial statements, falsifying business records and conspiracy claims. “They also served as co-executives running the company from January 2017 to today, in which they had intimate knowledge of the Trump Organization’s business, assets, and were provided with financial updates upon request,” Engoron wrote Friday. The judge knocked Eric Trump credibility in his ruling, pointing out inconsistent testimony he gave at trial. “Eric Trump credibility was severely damaged when he repeatedly denied knowing that his father ever even compiled an SFC that valued his assets and showed his net worth ‘until this case came into fruition.’” He “begrudgingly” conceded at trial that he actually knew about his father’s statements as early as 2013 “upon being confronted with copious documentary evidence conclusively demonstrating otherwise,” the judge wrote. Engoron also said Eric Trump unconvincingly tried to distance himself from some appraisals of Trump Org. properties that offered a much lower valuation than reported on Trump financial statements. Eric and Trump Jr. were both ordered to pay more than $4 million in disgorgement, or “ill-gotten” profits, they personally received from the 2022 sale of Trump hotel at the Old Post Office building in Washington DC. Ivanka Trump gets to keep her profits on the building sale because she was dismissed as a defendant in the case by an appeals court ahead of trial. But that didn’t stop Engoron from weighing in on her trial testimony, calling it “suspect.” “Ivanka Trump was a thoughtful, articulate, and poised witness, but the Court found her inconsistent recall, depending on whether she was questioned by OAG or the defense, suspect,” Engoron wrote. “In any event, what Ms. Trump cannot recall is memorialized in contemporaneous emails and documents; in the absence of her memory, the documents speak for themselves.” Next steps: Trump will appeal the ruling Trump attorneys have already appealed Engoron’s summary judgment last year that found the former president liable for fraud – and Trump attorneys are already planning to appeal this decision, too. Trump attorney Christopher Kise responded to Engoron’s ruling in a statement on Friday, saying the court “ignored the law, ignored the facts.” Kise added Trump will appeal and “remains confident the Appellate Division will ultimately correct the innumerable and catastrophic errors made.” During the 11-week trial, Trump attorneys repeatedly criticized Engoron’s handling of the case and raised objections “for the record” and a potential appeal. Engoron often acknowledged the likelihood of an appeal during the trial, raising his concerns with a reversal with the attorney general’s lawyers when he allowed the testimony of certain witnesses the AG objected to as part of Trump defense. The reality is that the ruling is likely to be tied up in the courts on appeal for a long time, and Engoron’s ruling Friday was written with an eye toward surviving an appellate challenge.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/republicans-biden-impeachment-fbi-informant/index.html,"House Republican leading the impeachment inquiry into Biden tried to downplay the importance of an FBI informant whose claims they once championed after he was charged with fabricating foreign bribery allegations involving the president and his son. Special counsel David Weiss charged the FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, with lying to the FBI and creating false records. According to the indictment, Smirnov “fabricated” a story about a Ukrainian oligarch paying millions of dollars in bribes to the Biden – allegations that Republican have made central to their impeachment inquiry into Biden. The informant’s uncorroborated – and now fully discredited – claims were memorialized in an internal FBI memo that Republican fought for months to obtain from the FBI and eventually made public in July over the bureau’s objections. The downplaying of the bombshell charges undermine how Republican have previously championed the discredited allegations as part of their investigation struggling to uncover wrongdoing by the president. While a spokesman for House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan told CNN “nothing has changed” in the wake of the charges, Jordan said on Fox last month “the most corroborating evidence we have is that 1023 form from this highly credible confidential human source.” House Oversight Chair James Comer said his work is “not reliant” on the now-debunked allegations and pointed to a “large record of evidence,” but when Republican were fighting to publicize the document that memorialized these claims, Comer said on Fox in May 2023 “this is a very crucial piece of our investigation.” And House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith, who is leading the inquiry with Jordan and Comer, said the allegations were a “smoking gun.” The “fabrications” and “false derogatory information” the informant is charged with further chip away at the broader Republican narrative that as vice president, Biden corruptly abused his powers to pressure Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor who was investigating Ukrainian energy company Burisma as a way to protect his son Hunter, who served on the firm’s board at the time. Even though those charges are largely based on already debunked claims about Biden dealings in Ukraine that emerged during Trump first impeachment, Jordan has said this is “the key thing” to their impeachment inquiry. The indictment is just the latest setback to House Republican who are struggling to build momentum to impeach the president. A growing number of Republican have said it is unlikely their monthslong investigation will ultimately lead to impeachment, given not enough are convinced there is sufficient evidence to do so. In their razor-thin majority , Republican narrowly squeaked by their effort to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas by one vote after failing to do so the first time, and sources say there are approximately 20 House Republican who at this point would not vote to impeach the president. In the wake of the charges, Biden called out the informant for lying and said Republican should end their impeachment inquiry. “He is lying, and it should be dropped. And it’s just been an outrageous effort from the beginning,” the president said. Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said this in the wake of the charges: “I formally call on Speaker Johnson, Chairman Comer, and House Republican to stop promoting this nonsense and end their doomed impeachment inquiry.” Republican leading the inquiry, however, say they have a mountain of evidence, including witness testimony and bank records, to withstand the recent indictment and criticisms about their investigation. The House Judiciary Committee released the transcript of their interview with former US Attorney Scott Brady on Friday, which had occurred in October. CNN previously reported Brady vetted the unverified claims from Smirnov and testified that he found some of the material credible enough to pass the tip along to the prosecutor leading the HunterBiden criminal probe. “This was a CHS that was known to the FBI, was credible, had been used – had provided information that was used in other investigations,” Brady said of Smirnov in the interview. Comer’s committee separately released the transcript of the interview with HunterBiden’s business associate Tony Bobulinski the day after the announcement of the charges against the FBI informant. In the wake of the charges, Republican have seized on the idea that Smirnov was initially presented as a credible witness. “When asked by the committee about their confidence in the confidential human source, the FBI told the committee the confidential human source was credible and trusted, had worked with the FBI for over a decade, and had been paid six figures. The FBI’s actions in this matter are very concerning,” Comer said Thursday. In the indictment, the FBI said they had used Smirnov “in various criminal investigations” dating back as early as 2010. When fighting to keep the FBI document memorializing Smirnov’s claims private last year, the FBI wrote to Congress that confidential human sources like Smirnov were “valuable.” The FBI told lawmakers during closed-door briefings that Smirnov, then an anonymous confidential human source, was credible. Raskin said after a briefing with the FBI last year, “There is a confidential human source that the FBI works with who is proven to be very credible who reported a conversation with someone else.” And looking forward, top Republican point to a pair of high-stakes depositions later this month with HunterBiden and the president’s brother, James, as a key next step of their probe and say they are not expected to make an official decision on whether to pursue impeachment articles until those are complete. But even before the charges were announced, lawmakers have been raising questions about the rest of the evidence produced by the investigation. In a recent meeting Republican committee staff leading the impeachment inquiry had with a group of GOP lawmakers, two GOP lawmakers told CNN they did not think investigators presented evidence that amounted to a smoking gun or a specific law that had been broken by the president. Instead, the lawmakers said, the investigators presented various scenarios they believed could lead to criminal wrongdoing. An Oversight Committee spokesperson pushed back: “The purpose of these updates is not to advise members on criminal laws.” And another GOP source countered the lawmakers’ characterization and said staff presented evidence of bribery, money laundering, conspiracy and obstruction. The committee is expected to issue a final report that will address criminal violations at the end of their investigation, the Oversight Committee spokesperson added","['house', 'republican',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/joe-manchin-president/index.html,"West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin announced Friday that he will not mount a 2024 campaign for president. “I will not be seeking a third-party run. I will not be involved in a presidential run,” the retiring Democrat senator said in a speech at West Virginia University in Morgantown. Manchin has been on a national listening tour as he weighed jumping in as a third-party presidential candidate , potentially on the No Labels ticket. He has criticized Biden for being too liberal but also said that he would refuse to be part of any effort that would help Trump return to the White House. Manchin had previously set a deadline of this spring to make a decision, but he is pulling the plug now to instead focus on a new group, Americans Together, which promotes moderate politics. Manchin, a centrist, has found himself at odds with members of his party throughout his congressional tenure, which began in 2010 after he won a special election for a vacant Senate seat. While he helped Biden notch some key legislative wins in the first half of his presidency, Manchin has also been an outspoken critic of the president – especially on issues such as the environment, energy and the economy. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny attends a hearing at a court in Moscow on June 24, 2019. Vasily Maximov/AFP via Getty Images Related article Navalny’s death puts a new spotlight on key dividing line between Trump and Biden In his speech Friday, Manchin torched both parties, though Republican in Washington and Trump got more of his ire. He ripped into the collapse of the bipartisan border deal last week amid a torrent of attacks on the legislation by top House Republican and Trump, who has made the border a central campaign issue in his presidential bid. “So many good friends of mine, so many people I thought were there to do the right thing, they cowered to former Trump’s request not to fix the border,” Manchin said. “As guilty as Biden is for letting it happen, Trump is ten times worse for not letting us fix it.” Manchin said Washington needs to move on commonsense ideas that are widely popular in the country, including codifying abortion rights that had been protected by Roe v. Wade, eliminating the national debt and more gun safety. On the last point, he invoked the recent shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl celebration rally as the latest example of how much gun laws need more of an update. “I’m not trying to ban anything. I’m just trying to make sure that responsible people know how to use guns responsibly. And that certain guns shouldn’t be in the hands of people. That’s just common sense,” Manchin said. He also scolded liberal Democrat for trying to push too many cultural changes on the country. “You’re not going to make me accept things I don’t believe in. But on the other side, I’m not going to let you criticize and ostracize something for what they believe in,” the senator said. Manchin accused the Democrat Party of restricting competitiveness, pointing to presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ’s trouble getting taken seriously at party events. “If a person whose last name is Kennedy … can’t even participate in the Democrat Party in today’s world,” Manchin said, “it tells you the system is broken. The system is controlled and broken.” Kennedy launched a Democrat primary challenge to Biden last spring but switched to an independent run in October. West Virginia Sen.

Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images Related article Joe Manchin could upend Biden reelection campaign – and blow up No Labels along the way Just a few months ago, with speculation spiking about a No Labels presidential unity ticket, Manchin was at the top of the list of potential candidates. So was Larry Hogan, the Republican former governor of Maryland. But in one measure of where things stand with the group, in addition to Manchin’s decision, Hogan opted for a Senate run in the Old Line State last week. “No Labels has spent 14 years working to create a movement for America’s commonsense majority and we welcome Senator Manchin’s efforts to strengthen it,” group leaders said in a statement Friday responding to Manchin’s announcement. The statement added that the group was speaking “with several exceptional leaders” and “will announce in the coming weeks whether we will offer our line to a Unity ticket.” Group officials have told CNN and others that their deadline is mid-March. But with weeks to go, the group has still not said anything about who will make the decision, or how. Not a ‘Washington Democrat’ Manchin announced in November that he would not seek a third full Senate term this fall, dealing a blow to Democrat chances of maintaining their narrow majority in the chamber. In an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins in November, he wouldn’t rule out a departure from his party. “I’ve never considered myself a Washington Democrat. I’ve been a very independent person,” he said when asked if he would leave the party. He told Collins he would not want to play “spoiler” in a potential Biden-Trump rematch. But he said another Trump presidency would be a threat to the country: “I think we lose democracy as we know it” if Trump wins a second term, “because he has no regard whatsoever for the rule of law.” Over the past several months, Manchin has made public stops in states such as New Hampshire, SouthCarolina and Georgia, saying he believed there’s a role for him as a national icon in the “fiscally responsible and socially compassionate” middle, comparable with the role Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders plays for the progressive left. Polls have shown that both Biden and Trump remain unpopular nationwide. A recent CNN/SSRS survey found that 59% of Americans held an unfavorable view of Biden, and 55% felt the same way about Trump. But while polling consistently shows that the idea of a third-party or independent candidate for president is popular, in reality, third-party bids rarely generate as much support as pre-election polling would suggest.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/trump-legal-drama-complications/index.html,"Every day, America gets dragged deeper into Trump legal, political and constitutional morass. This plight was exacerbated by a day of raw drama Thursday in a handful of cities, in multiple cases involving defiant personalities often trading personal smears that tightened the fateful knot between the 2024 election and the ex-president’s staggering legal battle. By nightfall, new truths had emerged about Trump fight for his fortune and political career and looming months certain to leave the nation even more estranged, especially as millions of his supporters believe his claims of political persecution. A judge in NewYork dismissed the last obstacle to the first-ever criminal trial of a former president. Jury selection will begin on March 25 in Trump hush money trial. A guilty verdict could mean this year’s potential GOP nominee will be a convicted felon. But if he’s found innocent by a jury of his peers it could also transform the election. The ex-president’s election interference case in Georgia is on a knife-edge after an head-spinning day when two prosecutors were effectively put on trial themselves over a romantic relationship that defendants say should disqualify them and end the case. Even if they survive, Trump and his co-accused may have won the day after taking the chance to malign the prosecutors and to brand them as corrupt and unethical. Trump lawyers made a final, beseeching plea to the SupremeCourt to stop the clock in a federal trial over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Justices must now decide whether to take up one of the most profound cases in the body’s history. A special counsel charged a former informant with lying about the Biden family’s role in Ukraine, potentially dealing a massive blow to vital testimony Republican have used to justify an impeachment inquiry into Biden. Trump is braced for a potentially devastating outcome to a civil fraud trial as soon as Friday. A huge slice of the ex-president’s fortune is at risk along with his capacity to do business in the city where he built skyscrapers and his art of the deal mythology. The ex-president has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing in all cases. But at the end of a tempestuous day, his legal strategy was clearer than ever. First, seek to delay any trials or potential convictions until after the election. Second, allege criminality by those who are calling him to account. Trump last resort is a coordinated effort to impugn prosecutors, judges and courts to hedge against any possible guilty verdicts and to destroy their credibility among undecided voter. Video Ad Feedback Michael Cohen, set to testify, weighs in on Trump criminal case 01:58 - Source: CNN Gripping and humiliating testimony in Georgia Everything involving Trump devolves into a circus. So, it was in keeping with the times that the confirmation that a former commander-in-chief will face a criminal trial for the first time ever ended up being overshadowed. The distraction was a televised courtroom battle over claims by Trump and co-defendants that Fulton Country, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and a special prosecutor she appointed accrued financial gain during a romance. One of Trump co-accused, Michael Roman, has called for Willis to be dismissed and for the case to be thrown out, alleging that she and special prosecutor Nathan Wade, with whom she had a previous relationship, are conflicted. The stakes are enormous. If Willis is dismissed, the case will be sent to a jurisdiction outside Fulton County – a process that could take months, change the nature of the prosecution and certainly delay it until after November’s election. Like the NewYork hush money prosecution, the Georgia case is significant because as a state matter it is outside Trump potential capacity to halt if he wins the White House. And presidential pardon powers do not extend to such cases. “This case never ceases to amaze me,” Darryl Cohen, a former assistant district attorney in Fulton County who knew key figures in the case, told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “I watched Fani walk into that courtroom, she was walking in hot. … I thought we were watching a heavyweight fight,” Cohen said. “The bottom line is does it matter? Does this take anything away from the facts of the case? My answer is, it does not. It is a sideshow that has legs for the moment.” In dramatic testimony, Willis denied she had benefited from thousands of dollars in taxpayer funds paid to Wade him while the then-couple were on lavish vacations and on cruises. She said she reimbursed him in cash for travel expenses, saying that was a practice she learned from her father. This also explained why there was no paper trail for the transactions. The burden is on the defense to show Willis and Wade erred. It was not clear at the end of a day of intense exchanges that any of the lawyers arrayed against her had proved any evidence of corruption. Similarly, it would be hard to argue that any of the details that emerged prejudiced the capacity of Trump and his co-defendants in the vast racketeering case to get a fair trial. That leaves the ethical conduct of Willis and Wade, and the perceptions that they faced a conflict of interest. One legal analyst, defense attorney Caroline Polisi, argued that testimony from Robin Yeartie – a former co-worker and friend of Willis – that the relationship started well before the 2022 date named by both the district attorney and Wade could mean they had mislead the court. “An attorney lying to the court is not good,” Polisi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Several other observers, however, warned that Yeartie, as a disgruntled former employee, did not come across as a credible witness. But even if Willis and Wade are not disqualified, Thursday’s hearing – in which both were forced to answer humiliating questions on television about their sex lives and claims they were guilty of severe misconduct – served Trump purposes in seeking to taint their reputations and potential credibility ahead of a trial. The hearing, which was on television for hours, may have even influenced a future jury pool and Yeartie’s testimony is likely to fuel days of conservative media accounts. And as Willis pointed out, the spectacle had the impact of taking the focus away from Trump and his co-defendants over an alleged attempt to steal the vote of thousands of Georgians. “You think I am on trial. These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020,” Willis said, pointing at the lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants. “I am not on trial no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.” History beckons on March 25 Despite the drama in Georgia, history may most remember the moment on Thursday morning when Judge Juan Merchan rejected Trump calls for delays and a dismissal and confirmed the country will cross a constitutional and legal Rubicon on March 25. His decision to lock in the previously selected date means the hypothetical possibility of a front-running candidate going on trial months before the election will become a somber reality. The case is considered by many legal experts to be the weakest of the four criminal trials Trump faces and relies on a somewhat novel legal theory. Even if he is convicted, Trump probably wouldn’t face jail time. But the spectacle of the United States putting its past and possibly future leader on trial will transfix the world. In itself, it represents a profound political and legal test for American democracy and the rule of law – even if it is only one of Trump legal threats. Trump wasted no time in making clear how he intends to fight the case, emerging from the courtroom to vent to reporters in a pen of crash barriers, cutting a disquieting metaphorical image of a former president who almost looked like he was behind bars. Trump accused Biden of “election interference” over the case, casting it as “the only way he can think to get elected because he’s accomplished nothing.” There is no evidence the White House intervened in any way in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s prosecution. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche told Merchan that the trial was unfair because the ex-president needed to campaign ahead of November’s election and called for a delay. “What’s your legal argument?” Merchan asked. “That is my legal argument,” Blanche replied, before the judge added: “That’s not a legal argument” as he adjourned the hearing. By March 25, Trump may well have piled up most of the delegates he needs to win the Republican nomination. If he’s not the presumptive nominee already, he could be before a verdict lands in a trial that could last a month to six weeks. In a normal election, Trump would be keen to turn his fire on his likely general election foe, Biden, by late March. But he will be forced to spend day after day in court in NewYork. Asked how he could possibly campaign, he responded: “I’ll do it in the evening.” There is no way of knowing how voter will react if the ex-president is convicted despite some recent polls suggesting that some Republican may be less likely to support him after a guilty verdict. No one wants to go on trial, but if there was one case that the ex-president would prefer to face before the election it is the NewYork one. And despite his claims that he’ll never get a fair trial in Manhattan, a not guilty verdict could send its own shockwaves through the electorate. The former president’s politicized claims that he’s a victim of political persecution are only likely to be bolstered by news of a major development on Thursday that could undermine the House GOP’s impeachment goals. Special counsel David Weiss charged a former FBI informant with lying about the president and his son HunterBiden’s involvement in business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. Alexander Smirnov, 43, was arrested Thursday at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, after his arrival in the US from overseas. Like any other defendant, Smirnov is entitled to the presumption of innocence. But because his evidence has been frequently cited by House GOP investigators, his arrest has significant political implications.","['every', 'day', 'america', 'gets', 'dragged', 'deeper', 'trump',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/election-2024-trump-new-york-trial/index.html,"Sometimes, when Trump loses, he somehow seems to win as well. That may have been the case Thursday when two of the four criminal indictments against the former president appeared, at least momentarily, to turn in opposite directions. The trial date in his NewYork hush money case was confirmed to be March 25. Meanwhile, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis , who is bringing the election subversion case in Georgia, took the stand in a misconduct hearing surrounding her personal relationship with a prosecutor on her team. Trump lawyers are hoping to get the Georgia case thrown out or at least delayed over Willis’ conduct. Polling indicates that if Trump had to choose which case to go forward with at the fastest speed, he would most definitely, at this time, choose the NewYork case over the other ones. Most Americans just don’t think that the NewYork charges are all that serious. In fact, only 32% of voter said they were very serious in a Quinnipiac University poll taken toward the end of last year. This shouldn’t be all that surprising when you consider that everyone has long known about Trump supposed relationship with Stormy Daniels, which is a big part of NewYork prosecutor Alvin Bragg ’s case. The idea that Trump would be involved in paying off an adult film star, even if illegally, probably doesn’t shock that many people. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis speaks at a press conference next to prosecutor Nathan Wade after a Grand Jury brought back indictments against former president Trump and his allies in their attempt to overturn the state's 2020 election results, in Atlanta, Georgia, on August 14, 2023. Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters/File Related article Georgia Trump prosecutor Fani Willis misconduct hearing: What to watch On the other hand, the same Quinnipiac polling revealed that 54% of voter said the charges in the Georgia case over Trump efforts to reverse his 2020 defeat in the state were very serious. This lines up with what we know about how the American public feels more broadly. We have a lot of data from after the 2020 election when Trump refused to concede and tried to overturn his loss to Biden . Voter opinion of him slid during that period. Opinions of the two federal cases against him look a lot like that of Georgia. When it comes to Trump actions after the 2020 election and in the lead-up to the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, 56% said the charges were very serious. A similar 51% said the charges regarding his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving the White House were very serious. Other surveys confirm Quinnipiac’s general findings. Polling from AP-NORC shows that a similar majority of Americans think Trump did something illegal when it comes to pressuring Georgia public officials over the vote count in the state. Meanwhile, only about a third of them say Trump did something illegal when it comes to his actions around the NewYork hush money case. A plurality say he did something unethical, but not illegal. Of course, even if voter think Trump did something wrong in NewYork doesn’t mean they wouldn’t be willing to vote for him again. Just 30% of voter in a CNN/SSRS poll last year said that the NewYork charges, if true, would disqualify him from the presidency. Among voter who were at least initially undecided in a matchup between Trump and Biden, a similar 33% said the NewYork charges, if true, would disqualify him. Opinions could change Now, these numbers in the NewYork case could change if Trump were actually convicted and as voter pay more attention. After all, a hypothetical conviction is very different from an actual one. But if they hold steady, it’s not hard to see how Trump could get off relatively unscathed, even if he is found guilty in NewYork. He might also try to use the case to his political advantage. Not only could he try to rally his base, but he could also try to convince those in the middle that he’s been unfairly prosecuted in a case in which many don’t think he did something illegal. That well could be the case if the NewYork case finishes first, which looks most likely given that it will probably start first. Trump might try to influence public perceptions about the other cases based on how people feel about the NewYork one. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis takes the stand on Thursday in Atlanta. Pool Related article Takeaways from Fani Willis’ stunning testimony in Georgia Because at this moment, the public sees those other cases far differently in the context of the 2024 election. Using the Georgia election subversion case as an example, a near majority of voter in the CNN/SSRS poll said the charges in Georgia, if true, would be disqualifying for Trump and the presidency. It’s much harder to win an election when about half the voter think you should be disqualified. Among the at least initially undecided voter in the same survey, 58% said the Georgia charges would be disqualifying, if true. In an election as tight as 2024 will be, you really don’t want to have 58% of undecided voter saying that. Of course, the Georgia case is currently on an uncertain timeline with a lead prosecutor who may not end up being the prosecutor who brings the case to trial. Additionally, we have to contend with the fact that we don’t know how the court proceedings in Georgia could affect opinions of the case, even if Willis remains the prosecutor leading it. The bottom line is that no one wants to be on trial, but if Trump had to pick, he’d much rather go first with the NewYork case.","['sometimes', 'trump', 'loses', 'somehow', 'seems', 'win', 'well',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/house-republicans-robert-hur/index.html,"House Republican have reached out to special counsel Robert Hur to discuss having him testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee about his report on Biden’s handling of classified documents, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Hur’s report released last week did not charge the president with a crime, but it painted a picture of a forgetful commander in chief who failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information – a depiction that could hurt Biden politically and that Republican have seized on. Hur has retained Bill Burck, who previously represented special counsel John Durham, as his personal attorney. While there is no date on the calendar, they are looking toward the end of February, one of the sources told CNN. The Justice Department declined to comment. House Republican leading the impeachment inquiry also asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to turn over the transcript of the special counsel’s interview with the president in a new letter on Monday. The Republican committee chairs are also asking the Department of Justice to supply Congress with “any recordings, notes, or summaries” of the special counsel’s interview with the president. Beyond that, Republican request the Justice Department turn over classified documents related to Ukraine as they continue to attempt to draw connections between Biden official actions as vice president and his son’s foreign business dealings at the time. “There is concern that Biden may have retained sensitive documents related to specific countries involving his family’s foreign business dealings” House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, Oversight Chair James Comer, and Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith wrote in the letter. The two special counsels appointed during the Trump presidency, Robert Mueller and Durham, both testified to Congress once they submitted their reports to the Justice Department. After expressing some reluctance, Mueller agreed to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees in July 2019 about his investigation, delivering halting and stilted responses that mostly stuck to his report. The negotiations for Mueller’s appearance stretched out for weeks, ultimately leading to an agreement in which he appeared after he was subpoenaed. Last June, Durham testified to the House Judiciary Committee about his investigation and report into the FBI’s probe into Trump and Russia, and he spoke behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee. Hur’s special counsel report found that Biden willfully retained classified information, including top secret documents, and knew he was in possession of some documents as far back as 2017. He also shared some of that information with the ghostwriter of his 2017 memoir. The special counsel decided not to charge the president in the case – primarily because he found that nothing proved a willful intent by Biden to illegally hold onto classified information and the president cooperated with the investigation. Yet, in a politically damaging line of reasoning, Hur wrote that one reason Biden wasn’t going to be prosecuted was because he would present to a jury as an elderly man “with a poor memory.” Biden lawyers objected to the description – calling it “investigative excess” and accusing Hur of flouting Justice Department rules and norms. The report is sure to become an issue in the 2024 campaign – where Biden likely opponent, Trump, is facing criminal charges for his handling of classified material, even though Hur made clear how different the two cases were.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/joe-biden-house-ukraine/index.html,"Biden on Friday criticized the House for taking a two-week break amid a heated push for additional funding for Ukraine in its war against Russia. After addressing reports of Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny’s death on Friday, Biden was asked by reporters whether there was any way to get additional ammunition to Ukraine without the passage of a supplemental funding bill by Congress. “No, but it’s about time they step up, don’t you think?” the president said. “Instead of going on a two-week vacation.” Biden raised his voice: “Two weeks, they’re walking away. Two weeks. What are they thinking? My God, this is bizarre, and it’s just reinforcing all of the concern and almost – I won’t say panic – but real concern about the United States being a reliable ally. This is outrageous.” The push comes at a crucial time for Ukraine. American officials previously warned that US aid to the war-torn country ran out last year, and the US provides more funding than any other country to Ukraine. The Senate passed a bipartisan $95 billion bill that provided the Ukraine funding, along with support for Taiwan and Israel, but House Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled he won’t bring the bill to the House floor. The House is on recess until the end of this month. Responding to Nalvany’s reported death, Johnson said that while “Congress debates the best path forward to support Ukraine, the United States, and our partners, must be using every means available to cut off Putin’s ability to fund his unprovoked war in Ukraine and aggression against the Baltic states.” Johnson and other House Republican had demanded that any additional funding to Ukraine be tied to significant immigration-related funding and policy changes. Democrat made some concessions for the Senate bill, but prospects of a funding bill passing the House were torpedoed after former Trump pushed Republican to oppose it. And the prospects of additional funding after the election remains in question if Trump, the GOP frontrunner who recently signaled indifference to Russia invading a NATO ally, wins in the fall. A small group of bipartisan House members have unveiled their own plan to send more money to Ukraine in an effort to put pressure on Johnson to act. But, it’s unclear whether that could get enough support in the chamber. Biden said on Friday that “failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten.” “Now, as I said before, and I mean this in a literal sense, history is watching. History is watching the House of Representatives,” the president said. Asked whether Navalny’s reported death would burgeon support for additional funding from members of Congress, Biden said “I hope to God it helps.” This story has been updated with additional reporting.","['biden', 'friday', 'criticized', 'house', 'taking', 'twoweek', 'break', 'amid', 'heated', 'push', 'additional', 'funding', 'ukraine', 'war', 'russia', 'addressing', 'reports', 'russian', 'opposition', 'figure', 'alexey', 'navalny’s', 'death', 'friday', 'biden', 'asked', 'reporters', 'whether', 'way', 'additional', 'ammunition', 'ukraine', 'without', 'passage', 'supplemental', 'funding', 'bill', 'congress', '“no', 'step', 'don’t', 'think”', 'president', '“instead', 'going', 'twoweek', 'vacation”', 'biden', 'raised', 'voice', '“two', 'weeks', 'they’re', 'walking', 'away', 'two', 'weeks', 'thinking', 'god', 'bizarre', 'reinforcing', 'concern', 'almost', 'won’t', 'say', 'panic', 'real', 'concern', 'united', 'states', 'reliable', 'ally', 'outrageous”', 'push', 'comes', 'crucial', 'ukraine', 'american', 'officials', 'previously', 'warned', 'us', 'aid', 'wartorn', 'country', 'ran', 'last', 'year', 'us', 'provides', 'funding', 'country', 'ukraine', 'senate', 'passed', 'bipartisan', '95', 'billion', 'bill', 'provided', 'ukraine', 'funding', 'along', 'support', 'taiwan', 'israel', 'house', 'speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'signaled', 'won’t', 'bring', 'bill', 'house', 'floor', 'house', 'recess', 'end', 'month', 'responding', 'nalvany’s', 'reported', 'death', 'johnson', '“congress', 'debates', 'best', 'path', 'forward', 'support', 'ukraine', 'united', 'states', 'partners', 'must', 'using', 'every', 'means', 'available', 'cut', 'putin’s', 'ability', 'fund', 'unprovoked', 'war', 'ukraine', 'aggression', 'baltic', 'states”', 'johnson', 'house', 'republican', 'demanded', 'additional', 'funding', 'ukraine', 'tied', 'significant', 'immigrationrelated', 'funding', 'policy', 'changes', 'democrat', 'made', 'concessions', 'senate', 'bill', 'prospects', 'funding', 'bill', 'passing', 'house', 'torpedoed', 'trump', 'pushed', 'republican', 'oppose', 'prospects', 'additional', 'funding', 'election', 'remains', 'question', 'trump', 'gop', 'frontrunner', 'recently', 'signaled', 'indifference', 'russia', 'invading', 'nato', 'ally', 'wins', 'fall', 'small', 'group', 'bipartisan', 'house', 'members', 'unveiled', 'plan', 'send', 'money', 'ukraine', 'effort', 'put', 'pressure', 'johnson', 'act', 'unclear', 'whether', 'enough', 'support', 'chamber', 'biden', 'friday', '“failure', 'support', 'ukraine', 'critical', 'moment', 'never', 'forgotten”', '“now', 'mean', 'literal', 'sense', 'history', 'watching', 'history', 'watching', 'house', 'representatives”', 'president', 'asked', 'whether', 'navalny’s', 'reported', 'death', 'burgeon', 'support', 'additional', 'funding', 'members', 'congress', 'biden', 'hope', 'god', 'helps”', 'updated', 'additional', 'reporting']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/allison-greenfield-engoron-judge/index.html,"The law clerk Trump accused of “co-judging” his civil fraud trial is running for her own seat in Manhattan civil court in the upcoming November elections. Allison Greenfield was a frequent point of contention for Trump legal team – even costing Trump thousands in fines for violating a gag order barring him from talking about her. Trump lawyers complained about her presence on the bench seated next to the judge, accusing her of ‘co-judging’ as she often passed notes to Judge Arthur Engoron and whispered in his ear before he ruled. Engoron imposed a gag order in the first week of trial after Trump published negative social media posts about Greenfield accusing her of bias and made an unfounded claim about a relationship with a top senator. The judge later expanded the gag order to cover the attorneys and fined Trump twice for violating the order after continued public criticisms of Greenfield. Trump legal team made several unsuccessful bids to appeal the gag order, arguing that Trump lawyers should be able to make a record of what they say was bias against the former president. During the trial, Engoron fiercely defended his law clerk of five years during the 11-week trial, pounding his fist on the bench as he reprimanded Trump lawyers and at one point suggested their complaints were misogynistic. Trump attorney Alina Habba pushed back on that notion, telling Engoron she was equally offended by Greenfield’s attitude toward Trump defense team and “eye rolls and constant whispering.” Greenfield could soon have a bench of her own as she’s currently running unopposed, according to a source familiar with the matter. She’s running for a countywide civil court position that is a lower-level judgeship than that of her boss, who had to win another election to make the rise from county judge to the state SupremeCourt. The Democrat candidate has received several endorsements from partisan groups in recent weeks including the Manhattan Democrat Party. The Manhattan Democrat Party’s Civil Court Independent Judicial Screening Panel named her as one of the “most highly qualified” candidates earlier this month.","['law', 'clerk', 'trump', 'accused', '“cojudging”', 'civil', 'fraud', 'trial', 'running', 'seat', 'manhattan', 'civil', 'court', 'upcoming', 'november', 'elections', 'allison', 'greenfield', 'frequent', 'point', 'contention', 'trump', 'legal', 'team', 'costing', 'trump', 'thousands', 'fines', 'violating', 'gag', 'order', 'barring', 'talking', 'trump', 'lawyers', 'complained', 'presence', 'bench', 'seated', 'next', 'judge', 'accusing', '‘cojudging’', 'often', 'passed', 'notes', 'judge', 'arthur', 'engoron', 'whispered', 'ear', 'ruled', 'engoron', 'imposed', 'gag', 'order', 'first', 'week', 'trial', 'trump', 'published', 'negative', 'social', 'media', 'posts', 'greenfield', 'accusing', 'bias', 'made', 'unfounded', 'claim', 'relationship', 'top', 'senator', 'judge', 'later', 'expanded', 'gag', 'order', 'cover', 'attorneys', 'fined', 'trump', 'twice', 'violating', 'order', 'continued', 'public', 'criticisms', 'greenfield', 'trump', 'legal', 'team', 'made', 'several', 'unsuccessful', 'bids', 'appeal', 'gag', 'order', 'arguing', 'trump', 'lawyers', 'able', 'make', 'record', 'say', 'bias', 'president', 'trial', 'engoron', 'fiercely', 'defended', 'law', 'clerk', 'five', 'years', '11week', 'trial', 'pounding', 'fist', 'bench', 'reprimanded', 'trump', 'lawyers', 'one', 'point', 'suggested', 'complaints', 'misogynistic', 'trump', 'attorney', 'alina', 'habba', 'pushed', 'back', 'notion', 'telling', 'engoron', 'equally', 'offended', 'greenfield’s', 'attitude', 'toward', 'trump', 'defense', 'team', '“eye', 'rolls', 'constant', 'whispering”', 'greenfield', 'soon', 'bench', 'currently', 'running', 'unopposed', 'according', 'source', 'familiar', 'matter', 'running', 'countywide', 'civil', 'court', 'position', 'lowerlevel', 'judgeship', 'boss', 'win', 'another', 'election', 'make', 'rise', 'county', 'judge', 'state', 'supremecourt', 'democrat', 'candidate', 'received', 'several', 'endorsements', 'partisan', 'groups', 'recent', 'weeks', 'including', 'manhattan', 'democrat', 'manhattan', 'democrat', 'party’s', 'civil', 'court', 'independent', 'judicial', 'screening', 'panel', 'named', 'one', '“most', 'highly', 'qualified”', 'candidates', 'earlier', 'month']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/trump-january-6-civil-lawsuits/index.html,"Civil lawsuits seeking to hold Trump accountable for the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack can move forward after the former president declined to ask the SupremeCourt to decide whether he is shielded by presidential immunity. A federal appeals court in December cleared the way for three lawsuits brought against Trump by Democrat lawmakers and US Capitol Police officers to proceed, unanimously holding that not everything a president does or says while in office is protected from liability. Trump faced a Thursday deadline to seek the SupremeCourt’s review of that decision, but his legal team declined to turn to the high court. The decision means the lawsuits will move to a fact-finding phase at the trial-level federal court in Washington, DC. Trump can continue to claim presidential immunity before that court, but it will be up to the judge overseeing the case to determine whether the conduct at issue was done in Trump official capacity as president or as a candidate and therefore not shielded by presidential immunity. The case could still eventually come before the SupremeCourt. The decision to not turn to the justices is a departure from how Trump team has been handling stinging lower-court rulings as he barrels toward the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. On Monday, the former president asked the SupremeCourt to temporarily block a unanimous decision issued last week by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals that rejected his claim that he’s immune from criminal election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. And last week, the justices heard oral arguments in a dispute over whether Trump should be disqualified from the ballot for his conduct on January 6, with a majority of them appearing ready to back the former president in the case. In the civil immunity matter, the plaintiffs in the three underlying lawsuits have all seized on Trump speech on January 6, alleging that his words led to the subsequent attack on the Capitol. The lawmakers claimed in a pair of lawsuits that they were threatened by Trump and others as part of a conspiracy to stop the congressional session that would certify the 2020 presidential election. They argue Trump should bear responsibility for directing the assaults. The police officers said in their suit that they were hit by chemical sprays and objects attendees threw at them because Trump inspired the crowd. Lower courts sided with the plaintiffs as Trump sought to have the cases dismissed based on his claims of presidential immunity. A federal judge in DC ruled in 2022 that Trump statements to his supporters before the riot “is the essence of civil conspiracy” because Trump spoke about himself and rallygoers working “towards a common goal” of fighting and walking down Pennsylvania Avenue. The DC Circuit later upheld that ruling , saying in December that the president “does not spend every minute of every day exercising official responsibilities.” “And when he acts outside the functions of his office, he does not continue to enjoy immunity. … When he acts in an unofficial, private capacity, he is subject to civil suits like any private citizen,” the court said in the unanimous ruling authored by Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan. The SupremeCourt is still considering whether to step into Trump federal criminal case related to January 6. In his emergency request earlier this week, the former president asked the high court to pause the DC Circuit’s ruling so he can appeal it to the justices and, potentially, a panel consisting of all the judges on the appeals court. In the DC Circuit’s ruling last week, the judges left no question that Trump can be prosecuted by Smith, writing: “For the purpose of this criminal case, former Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant.” “But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution,” the judges said. For now, Trump trial on federal charges that he worked to undermine the results of the 2020 election remains paused as the high court considers what to do with his emergency request","['civil', 'lawsuits', 'seeking', 'hold', 'trump', 'accountable', 'january', '6', '2021', 'us', 'capitol', 'attack', 'move', 'forward', 'president', 'declined', 'ask', 'supremecourt', 'decide', 'whether', 'shielded', 'presidential', 'immunity', 'federal', 'appeals', 'court', 'december', 'cleared', 'way', 'three', 'lawsuits', 'brought', 'trump', 'democrat', 'lawmakers', 'us', 'capitol', 'police', 'officers', 'proceed', 'unanimously', 'holding', 'everything', 'president', 'office', 'protected', 'liability', 'trump', 'faced', 'thursday', 'deadline', 'seek', 'supremecourt’s', 'review', 'decision', 'legal', 'team', 'declined', 'turn', 'high', 'court', 'decision', 'means', 'lawsuits', 'move', 'factfinding', 'phase', 'triallevel', 'federal', 'court', 'washington', 'dc', 'trump', 'continue', 'claim', 'presidential', 'immunity', 'court', 'judge', 'overseeing', 'case', 'determine', 'whether', 'conduct', 'issue', 'done', 'trump', 'official', 'capacity', 'president', 'candidate', 'therefore', 'shielded', 'presidential', 'immunity', 'case', 'still', 'eventually', 'come', 'supremecourt', 'decision', 'turn', 'justices', 'departure', 'trump', 'team', 'handling', 'stinging', 'lowercourt', 'rulings', 'barrels', 'toward', '2024', 'republican', 'presidential', 'nomination', 'monday', 'president', 'asked', 'supremecourt', 'temporarily', 'block', 'unanimous', 'decision', 'issued', 'last', 'week', 'dc', 'circuit', 'court', 'appeals', 'rejected', 'claim', 'he’s', 'immune', 'criminal', 'election', 'subversion', 'charges', 'brought', 'special', 'counsel', 'jack', 'smith', 'last', 'week', 'justices', 'heard', 'oral', 'arguments', 'dispute', 'whether', 'trump', 'disqualified', 'ballot', 'conduct', 'january', '6', 'majority', 'appearing', 'ready', 'back', 'president', 'case', 'civil', 'immunity', 'matter', 'plaintiffs', 'three', 'underlying', 'lawsuits', 'seized', 'trump', 'speech', 'january', '6', 'alleging', 'words', 'led', 'subsequent', 'attack', 'capitol', 'lawmakers', 'claimed', 'pair', 'lawsuits', 'threatened', 'trump', 'others', 'part', 'conspiracy', 'stop', 'congressional', 'session', 'certify', '2020', 'presidential', 'election', 'argue', 'trump', 'bear', 'responsibility', 'directing', 'assaults', 'police', 'officers', 'suit', 'hit', 'chemical', 'sprays', 'objects', 'attendees', 'threw', 'trump', 'inspired', 'crowd', 'lower', 'courts', 'sided', 'plaintiffs', 'trump', 'sought', 'cases', 'dismissed', 'based', 'claims', 'presidential', 'immunity', 'federal', 'judge', 'dc', 'ruled', '2022', 'trump', 'statements', 'supporters', 'riot', '“is', 'essence', 'civil', 'conspiracy”', 'trump', 'spoke', 'rallygoers', 'working', '“towards', 'common', 'goal”', 'fighting', 'walking', 'pennsylvania', 'avenue', 'dc', 'circuit', 'later', 'upheld', 'ruling', 'saying', 'december', 'president', '“does', 'spend', 'every', 'minute', 'every', 'day', 'exercising', 'official', 'responsibilities”', '“and', 'acts', 'outside', 'functions', 'office', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'immunity', '…', 'acts', 'unofficial', 'private', 'capacity', 'subject', 'civil', 'suits', 'like', 'private', 'citizen”', 'court', 'unanimous', 'ruling', 'authored', 'chief', 'judge', 'sri', 'srinivasan', 'supremecourt', 'still', 'considering', 'whether', 'step', 'trump', 'federal', 'criminal', 'case', 'related', 'january', '6', 'emergency', 'request', 'earlier', 'week', 'president', 'asked', 'high', 'court', 'pause', 'dc', 'circuit’s', 'ruling', 'appeal', 'justices', 'potentially', 'panel', 'consisting', 'judges', 'appeals', 'court', 'dc', 'circuit’s', 'ruling', 'last', 'week', 'judges', 'left', 'question', 'trump', 'prosecuted', 'smith', 'writing', '“for', 'purpose', 'criminal', 'case', 'trump', 'become', 'citizen', 'trump', 'defenses', 'criminal', 'defendant”', '“but', 'executive', 'immunity', 'may', 'protected', 'served', 'president', 'longer', 'protects', 'prosecution”', 'judges', 'trump', 'trial', 'federal', 'charges', 'worked', 'undermine', 'results', '2020', 'election', 'remains', 'paused', 'high', 'court', 'considers', 'emergency', 'request']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/navalny-death-biden-trump-divide/index.html,"The announcement of Alexey Navalny’s death on Friday thrust fresh urgency into the roiling debate in Washington over how forcefully to counter Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, a question of wide-ranging consequence on which Biden and his likely opponent Trump have adopted diametrically opposed positions. The disparity in how the two men reacted to the news underscored the divide. “Make no mistake: Putin is responsible for Navalny’s death. Putin is responsible. What has happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin’s brutality. Nobody should be fooled,” Biden said from the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Friday, forcefully pinning blame on “Putin and his thugs.” Trump, meanwhile, said nothing directly about the Russian opposition leader in a post that his campaign said was his official response to Navalny’s death. Instead, he spent the morning posting more than 20 times on Truth Social about his criminal cases, his election poll numbers, immigrants in the US, his GOP presidential rival Nikki Haley, the Teamsters labor union and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ testimony in Georgia. For Democrat and a minority of Republican who are proponents of a muscular American presence in Europe within the NATO defense alliance, Navalny’s death served as yet another grim reminder of Putin’s brutality and the necessity of a US-led effort to isolate Moscow. But for skeptics in the Trump camp, it was far from clear whether even the death in a notoriously brutal prison camp of Putin’s leading critic would alter a hardening view that Russia’s aggression no longer requires robust western reprisals, and that the nearly 80-year-old US-led security architecture in Europe is outdated. The stakes could hardly be higher, and Biden warned forcefully from the White House that “history is watching” the debate unfold. “The failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten,” Biden said Friday. “It’s going to go down in the pages of history. It really is. It’s consequential. And the clock is ticking.” The decision US politicians make in the coming weeks and months on whether to continue sending assistance to Ukraine could dramatically alter the battlefield realties there and send a global signal of American willingness not only to push back on Russia but to involve itself abroad at all. Other top Biden administration officials wasted little time pinning blame on Navalny’s death directly on Putin, even as the Kremlin said it was working to determine the cause. “Whatever story they tell, let us be clear Russia is responsible and we’ll have more to say on this later,” Vice President Kamala Harris said at the start of an address at the Munich Security Conference, where American support for Ukraine and to its NATO commitments has been a central and pressing topic of conversation. A few moments earlier, Secretary of State Antony Blinken linked Navalny’s death directly to Russia’s president. “His death in a Russian prison and the fixation and fear of one man only underscores the weakness and rot at the heart of the system that Putin has built,” the US top diplomat said at the start of a meeting with Indian officials on the sidelines of the Munich gathering. Lingering just underneath those pronouncements was the reality that in the United States, the long-held consensus on the value of alliances and systems to guard against Russian aggression is fraying. Asked whether Navalny’s death might spur Congress to act in providing more Ukraine aid, Biden was hopeful. “I hope to God it helps,” he said. Trump has shattered orthodox thinking Trump, who seems to be reveling in undermining what had been a bipartisan consensus in American foreign policy for more than 70 years, has said he would encourage Russia to attack NATO allies who “didn’t pay” — a remark that sent shockwaves through the defense alliance , which had already been bracing for his potential return to office in 2025, but was hardly surprising to his followers. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and fellow Republican have refused to consider a spending package that includes around $60 billion in new funding for Ukraine, despite administration warnings that Ukrainian troops are running out of ammunition and failing to support Kyiv would amount to a victory for Putin. Even so, Johnson said in a statement Friday that Putin “is likely directly responsible” for Navalny’s death. And Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host with a major conservative following, returned from an interview with Putin last week proclaiming how much nicer and cleaner Moscow was than any American city. Trump has reportedly mused about selecting Carlson as a running mate. A select number of Republican have sought to guard against the growing strain of isolationism within their party. On Friday, Trump sole remaining competitor for the Republican presidential nomination, former SouthCarolina Gov. Nikki Haley, assailed her opponent for saying he would encourage Russia to invade other nations. “Think about what that says, that Trump siding with a thug who kills his political opponents. By the way, he killed another one this morning,” Haley said on a SouthCarolina radio show. “He’s siding with Putin, who continues to try and destroy America at every turn.” For Biden and his top officials, the assault on international norms and institutions has generated both fury and concern. Biden was aghast at Trump remark when he learned about it last weekend and condemned it as “dumb” and “un-American” in a speech from the White House on Tuesday. A campaign issue On Friday, the Biden campaign unveiled a new digital ad blasting Trump comment. “Every president since Truman has been a rock-solid supporter of NATO - except for Trump,” a narrator says as images of Trump with Putin flashes across the screen. “Trump wants to walk away from NATO. He’s even given Putin and Russia the greenlight to attack America’s allies.” Part of a three-week, six-figure digital ad campaign, the spot is set to run through Super Tuesday targeting voter in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The campaign said it was looking to reach more than 2.5 million Americans who identify as Estonian, Finnish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian and Polish — all NATO countries bordering Russia. In 2021, Biden emerged from his first face-to-face meeting with Putin to say he had warned his counterpart that he’d be punished if Navalny were to die in prison. “I made it clear to him that I believe the consequences of that would be devastating for Russia,” Biden said in Geneva, where the summit was held. Since then, the United States and its partners in Europe and Asia have piled sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, seeking to isolate the country from the global financial system and ratchet up costs on the perpetrators of the war. But it’s those same sanctions that have caused energy prices to rise in Europe and taken a toll on the global economy, lending grist to some Republican efforts to halt foreign funding for Ukraine’s military and urge an immediate end to the conflict. As American assistance for Ukraine wavers, defense officials have warned of the consequences on the battlefield. On Friday, an official told reporters the US is “sixteenth in the world” among the countries providing security assistance to Ukraine when considering the percentage of GDP. “At this point, the United States is — we’re not the top donor to Ukraine when it comes to security assistance, or economic assistance for that matter,” the official told reporters. “When you look at security assistance, we’re actually the sixteenth in the world when it comes to percentage of GDP. So we have a lot to appreciate from our allies and partners.” Harris, who was already preparing to provide reassurances to rattled allies during her visit to the Munich conference this week, sought to underscore American commitment to protecting democracy and freedom around the world, and took veiled aim at Trump for suggesting otherwise. “They suggest it’s in the best interest of the American people to isolate ourselves from the world, to flout common understandings among nations, to embrace dictators, and adopt the repressive tactics and abandon commitments to our allies in favor of unilateral action,” Harris said in her remarks at the yearly gathering of US and European leaders, which has traditionally acted as a citadel of transatlanticism. “Let me be clear—that worldview is dangerous, destabilizing and indeed shortsighted,” she said. Shortly after Harris left the stage, Navalny’s wife made a surprise appearance in Munich to urge the international community to fight against Putin’s “horrific” regime. “They will be brought to justice, and this day will come soon,” she said.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/alejandro-mayorkas-cnntv/index.html,"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Friday defended his record on the border, saying his impeachment by House Republican has no basis in fact or law and he has no plans to slow down his work. In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour at the Munich Security Conference, his first since Tuesday’s impeachment vote, Mayorkas downplayed the vote’s effects on his day-to-day job, despite becoming the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in 150 years. “I don’t let it distract me from the work – would I have preferred that correctness had prevailed? Of course,” Mayorkas told Amanpour. “So, the fact that it did not, does not, slow me down in doing the work that I’m tasked to do by the president of the United States.” The embattled homeland security secretary spoke to CNN on the sidelines of the annual security conference. In a wide-ranging interview, he also commented on the reported death of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny and defended Biden’s mental acuity in the wake of special counsel Robert Hur’s report. As a member of the administration’s delegation to the conference, Mayorkas rebuffed the idea that Tuesday’s impeachment had compromised his standing with world leaders. “They very, very well understand the politics of the moment – not only in the United States, but in their respective countries as well,” he said. “And the leaders with whom I am meeting, the great majority of which I have met before – they know me. They know me, they know the seriousness of my purpose, and the fact that I am focused on mission. The politics are an aside.” Mayorkas left the door open to defending himself during impeachment proceedings in the Senate but declined to weigh in definitively either way, telling Amanpour, “We’ll see what the process brings.” CNN reported earlier this week that the Senate is unlikely to spend much time on the impeachment trial, with sources saying that Democrat could dismiss charges on a simple majority vote before each side argues its case. Mayorkas was impeached by House Republican over their claims that he had committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar. Tuesday’s vote was 214 to 213. Three Republican – Ken Buck of Colorado, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Tom McClintock of California – voted with Democrat against the measure. Republican have been investigating Mayorkas’ handling of the border since they reclaimed the House majority, but momentum to plot a swift impeachment of the secretary picked up steam last month as key swing-district Republican expressed fresh openness to the idea amid a recent surge of migrant crossings at the southern border . In the interview Friday, Mayorkas acknowledged “unanimity” across the political spectrum “that our system in the United States – our immigration system – is broken.” But he called on Republican in Congress to back bipartisan immigration reform. “I was very privileged and honored to sit with a bipartisan group of senators to fashion legislative fixes that are overdue now for decades,” he said. “It is in fact what the Republican insisted upon – the bipartisan group of senators delivered, the question that everyone is asking is, was a solution actually desired, or do people want the problem as a tool for politics?” On Navalny’s reported death, Mayorkas told Amanpour in an interview on Friday that, if confirmed, it would mark “tragic news for the world.” “We are, of course, still confirming it, but it speaks to the depravity of Vladimir Putin and our need, as a world, to have resolve against authoritarianism and the invasion of another country that is just yearning for its sovereignty,” Mayorkas told Amanpour. The homeland security secretary criticized House Republican for blocking additional aid to Ukraine, citing the administration’s efforts to present “a united front against Vladimir Putin.” “The inability to continue with emphasis that leadership on the part of the United States – the uncertainty that we are bringing – only can empower Vladimir Putin, and we have to continue our leadership,” he said. The homeland security secretary also took the opportunity to push back against last week’s special counsel report from Hur, taking issue with Hur’s characterization of Biden as an aging president beset by memory issues. “I’ve interacted with the president countless times,” Mayorkas told Amanpour. “I’ve said publicly the most difficult part about a meeting with Biden is preparing for it, because he is probing, exacting, and quite detail-oriented and focused.” And he called Hur’s comments on Biden ability to recall key events “inappropriate, and a deviation from Department of Justice norms.” “The responsibility of a prosecutor, including a special counsel, is to learn the facts, determine the facts, and apply the law to those facts – that was done, and the conclusion is that no case was there, and therefore the case is closed,” Mayorkas said. “To add the fact that those gratuitous personal remarks were terribly inaccurate only makes it even more inappropriate.”","['homeland', 'security', 'secretary', 'alejandro', 'mayorkas', 'friday', 'defended', 'record', 'border', 'saying', 'impeachment', 'house', 'republican', 'basis', 'fact', 'law',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/house-foreign-aid-border-bill/index.html,"A small group of bipartisan House lawmakers has unveiled their own plan to send aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and crack down on illegal crossings at the southern border, an effort to put additional pressure on Speaker Mike Johnson to act on Ukraine aid even as House lawmakers recess until the end of the month. Despite the Senate passing a bipartisan bill that provided $95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan earlier this week, Johnson has signaled he won’t bring that bill to the floor in the House as he faces pressure from his right flank not to act on Ukraine aid. It’s not clear that the new bill will break through in a chamber where there has been growing conservative resistance to voting on more aid to Ukraine and likely liberal opposition to some of the immigration provisions included in the bill. The plan, which was authored by 10 members including Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and Maine Democrat Rep. Jared Golden, would provide more than $66 billion in military assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, but would not provide the same humanitarian aid included in the Senate bill. The legislation would also restore the so-called “Remain in Mexico” policy, which requires individuals seeking asylum to return to Mexico until their case is ready for court in the US. “Securing one’s borders is necessary to preserve one’s democracy and therefore necessary to maintaining world order and world peace,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement. “But we also have an obligation to assist our allies in securing their borders, especially when they come under assault by dictators, terrorists and totalitarians.” Fitzpatrick told CNN that Republican who authored the bill plan will discuss their legislation with Johnson in the days ahead. But defense hawks in the House and many members running in swing districts in November have warned that they don’t want House Republican to be the reason Ukraine aid fails. “In the end, I don’t want it to be Republican’ legacy that Ukraine fell. Period,” Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska, told CNN last week. “We’ve been playing nice talking about the border and trying to link this, but that didn’t work. Now, we are going to be more forceful and forthright that Ukraine is in our national security interest.” There are few options remaining to get Ukraine aid on the floor, something that the White House has said for months is essential to ensuring that the country doesn’t lose its battle against Russia in the months ahead. If Johnson won’t put the legislation on the floor, Democrat could try to convince a handful of Republican to sign what is known as a discharge petition, an arcane and seldomly used device that would force a vote on Ukraine aid if a majority of the House signs on. It’s not clear that Republican – even a handful – would be willing to buck their leadership and force that vote. The odds of getting Ukraine aid out of the House has been made even more difficult by the fact that the front-runner to win the GOP nomination for president, Trump, has made clear he’s opposed to the Senate-passed bill. “WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE MONEY ANYMORE WITHOUT THE HOPE OF A PAYBACK, OR WITHOUT ‘STRINGS’ ATTACHED. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE ‘STUPID’ NO LONGER!” Trump posted Saturday on Truth Social.","['small', 'group', 'bipartisan', 'house', 'lawmakers', 'unveiled', 'plan', 'send', 'aid', 'ukraine', 'israel', 'taiwan', 'crack', 'illegal', 'crossings', 'southern', 'border', 'effort', 'put', 'additional', 'pressure', 'speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'act', 'ukraine', 'aid', 'house', 'lawmakers', 'recess', 'end', 'month', 'despite', 'senate', 'passing', 'bipartisan', 'bill', 'provided', '95', 'billion', 'aid', 'ukraine', 'israel', 'taiwan', 'earlier', 'week', 'johnson', 'signaled', 'won’t', 'bring', 'bill', 'floor', 'house', 'faces', 'pressure', 'right', 'flank', 'act', 'ukraine', 'aid', 'clear', 'new', 'bill', 'break', 'chamber', 'growing', 'conservative', 'resistance', 'voting', 'aid', 'ukraine', 'likely', 'liberal', 'opposition', 'immigration', 'provisions', 'included', 'bill', 'plan', 'authored', '10', 'members', 'including', 'pennsylvania', 'republican', 'rep', 'brian', 'fitzpatrick', 'maine', 'democrat', 'rep', 'jared', 'golden', 'provide', '66', 'billion', 'military', 'assistance', 'ukraine', 'israel', 'taiwan', 'provide', 'humanitarian', 'aid', 'included', 'senate', 'bill', 'legislation', 'restore', 'socalled', '“remain', 'mexico”', 'policy', 'requires', 'individuals', 'seeking', 'asylum', 'return', 'mexico', 'case', 'ready', 'court', 'us', '“securing', 'one’s', 'borders', 'necessary', 'preserve', 'one’s', 'democracy', 'therefore', 'necessary', 'maintaining', 'world', 'order', 'world', 'peace”', 'fitzpatrick', 'statement', '“but', 'obligation', 'assist', 'allies', 'securing', 'borders', 'especially', 'come', 'assault', 'dictators', 'terrorists', 'totalitarians”', 'fitzpatrick', 'republican', 'authored', 'bill', 'plan', 'discuss', 'legislation', 'johnson', 'days', 'ahead', 'defense', 'hawks', 'house', 'many', 'members', 'running', 'swing', 'districts', 'november', 'warned', 'don’t', 'want', 'house', 'republican', 'reason', 'ukraine', 'aid', 'fails', '“in', 'end', 'don’t', 'want', 'republican’', 'legacy', 'ukraine', 'fell', 'period”', 'rep', 'bacon', 'republican', 'nebraska', 'last', 'week', '“we’ve', 'playing', 'nice', 'talking', 'border', 'trying', 'link', 'didn’t', 'work', 'going', 'forceful', 'forthright', 'ukraine', 'national', 'security', 'interest”', 'options', 'remaining', 'ukraine', 'aid', 'floor', 'something', 'white', 'house', 'months', 'essential', 'ensuring', 'country', 'doesn’t', 'lose', 'battle', 'russia', 'months', 'ahead', 'johnson', 'won’t', 'put', 'legislation', 'floor', 'democrat', 'try', 'convince', 'handful', 'republican', 'sign', 'known', 'discharge', 'petition', 'arcane', 'seldomly', 'used', 'device', 'force', 'vote', 'ukraine', 'aid', 'majority', 'house', 'signs', 'clear', 'republican', 'handful', 'willing', 'buck', 'leadership', 'force', 'vote', 'odds', 'getting', 'ukraine', 'aid', 'house', 'made', 'difficult', 'fact', 'frontrunner', 'win', 'gop', 'nomination', 'president', 'trump', 'made', 'clear', 'he’s', 'opposed', 'senatepassed', 'bill', '“we', 'never', 'give', 'money', 'anymore', 'without', 'hope', 'payback', 'without', '‘strings’', 'attached', 'united', 'states', 'america', '‘stupid’', 'longer”', 'trump', 'posted', 'saturday', 'truth', 'social']"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/coast-guard-sexual-assault-senate-records-invs/index.html,"Records turned over to Congress this month reveal how top officials at the US Coast Guard engaged in a calculated plan to conceal the damning findings of an investigation into decades of sexual assault cases at the agency’s academy, going so far as to create a list of the pros and cons of being transparent. Coast Guard officials only told Congress about the explosive probe last year after CNN started making inquiries. Dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, the multi-year internal investigation found that rapes and other sexual abuse at the prestigious Coast Guard Academy had been ignored and often covered up by high-ranking officials. But telling Congress and the public about this scandal, leaders worried, could “risk the initiation of comprehensive Congressional investigations, hearings, and media interest,” according to 2018 internal records supplied to the Senate Homeland Security Committee’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in February. New London, Conn.--Sign on wall U.S. Coast Guard Academy facing Route 1  USCG photo by SANTOS, DAVID M. PA1 David M. Santos/U.S. Coast Guard/FILE Related article Four women to testify at Senate hearing about sexual harassment and assault at Coast Guard Academy The records, which do not carry the letterhead or signature of any identifiable author, carefully laid out multiple possible courses of action, and the option to proactively brief Congress was “NOT RECOMMENDED.” Among the concerns listed were “intense scrutiny of all past to present CGA leadership,” a potential demand for all sexual assault cases to be reviewed and “extensive media coverage and investigative journalism…and suggested malfeasance.” Public scrutiny could raise questions about why actions taken over the past decade to change the academy’s culture had not improved sexual assault reporting rates, the records stated. And in a handwritten list of pros and cons, which the Coast Guard confirmed to CNN was written by then-Vice Commandant Admiral Charles Ray, the “cons” of disclosing the investigation included “re-victimizing” and “investigations w/o end.” The “pros” were “rip bandaid off,” “proactive vs reactive” and “cultural guilt purged.” “If things are bad, they get worse with non-disclo[sure],” Ray wrote in a separate note, which appeared to list viewpoints of different Coast Guard officials. Ultimately, officials recommended in the records that information be provided to Congress or other parties only if asked. The Coast Guard did not tell CNN who authored the recommendations and noted that they were made before the investigation was officially closed. The agency emphasized that current Commandant Admiral Linda Fagan has acknowledged it was a mistake not to disclose the investigation to Congress and said it is fully cooperating with the Senate investigation – sifting through more than a million pages of documents and only making legally necessary redactions. Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan L. Noel/US Coast Guard Related article US Coast Guard leaders long concealed a critical report about racism, hazing and sexual misconduct CNN previously reported that the investigation’s concealing had gone to the top of the agency. The Commandant at the time, Admiral Karl Schultz, along with his second in command, Ray, had made the decision to keep Fouled Anchor secret after taking the helm in 2018. Ray resigned from a Coast Guard Academy leadership institute following CNN’s report on his role in withholding the information. Ray and Schultz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since the scandal came to light in June, Fagan has issued a series of unprecedented apologies to members of Congress, current and former academy cadets, and the entire Coast Guard workforce and has directed a host of reforms to how sexual assault cases are handled across the agency. “These documents are troubling and raise new questions,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, where the academy is based, and Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, wrote in a letter to Fagan on Wednesday about the new records they received. The senators are spearheading an investigation into the Coast Guard, which was launched in September in reaction to CNN’s reporting. Both senators have lambasted the Coast Guard for its lack of transparency and cooperation with the investigation, saying at a December hearing that subpoenas would be issued if necessary and that current leaders of both the academy and the agency may be called to answer for the decisions they have made. The Coast Guard said earlier this month in a news bulletin that it has already provided more than 36,000 pages of material in response to various ongoing investigations, including multiple congressional inquiries and a probe launched by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General. A House Oversight inquiry is looking beyond sexual assault, examining the Coast Guard’s handling of a variety of misconduct after CNN reported that agency leaders also suppressed a “Culture of Respect” review from April 2015 that documented racial and gender discrimination, hazing and assault across the service. So far, records provided to Congressional investigators have been missing attachments and have included redactions that prevent the subcommittee from “understanding the full scope of the Coast Guard’s decisions,” the senators wrote in Wednesday’s letter. They also requested that officials provide a list of names of anyone involved with the recently released records about the decision not to brief Congress. Blumenthal and Johnson, along with several other senators, proposed new bipartisan legislation this week that would make it safe for Coast Guard Academy cadets to report sexual assault and harassment without getting in trouble for minor infractions such as drinking or violating curfew. The Coast Guard announced a similar “safe to report” policy earlier this month, as part of yet another round of reforms enacted in the wake of CNN’s reporting. Other changes included increasing the legal experience required to become a Special Victims’ Counsel and decreasing the barriers to accessing benefits for victims of sexual assault.","['records',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/navy-federal-congressional-black-caucus/index.html,"Members of Congress pressed the CEO of the nation’s largest credit union for answers about racial disparities in its mortgage lending during a Capitol Hill meeting Thursday but said they left unsatisfied with her responses. Mary McDuffie, the CEO of Navy Federal Credit Union, met with three members of the Congressional Black Caucus who have demanded answers in the wake of CNN’s reporting on racial disparities in the lender’s mortgage approvals. She told them that an external review the credit union commissioned had preliminarily found that the disparities were mostly explained by other factors, a spokesperson said. But members of Congress said they still had concerns about the mortgage practices of Navy Federal, which has more than 13 million members and lends to military servicemembers, defense personnel, veterans and their families. “We’re trying to achieve the goal of closing the racial wealth gap in America,” said Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, after meeting with McDuffie. “You cannot do that with practices like this that deny equal opportunity to homeownership.” A CNN investigation published in December found that Navy Federal approved more than 75% of the White borrowers who applied for a new conventional home purchase mortgage in 2022 while approving less than 50% of Black borrowers who applied for the same type of loan, according to the most recent federal data available. Photo illustration. Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/Shutterstock Related article The nation’s largest credit union rejected more than half its Black conventional mortgage applicants The nearly 29-percentage-point gap in Navy Federal’s approval rates was the widest of any of the 50 lenders that originated the most mortgage loans in 2022. The disparity remained even after accounting for variables available in public mortgage data such as applicants’ income, debt-to-income ratio and property value, CNN’s review found. McDuffie met for about an hour Thursday with Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus; Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance; and Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California. McDuffie declined to answer CNN’s questions as she entered and exited the closed-door meeting. A Navy Federal spokesperson said in a statement that McDuffie shared with the House members the results of a “preliminary analysis” from an external review the credit union initiated showing that the racial disparity in approval rates “drops to around 1% when all other factors that we consider when approving home loans are incorporated, including credit score, verified income, and property information.” The spokesperson did not provide additional details or data supporting the analysis. Navy Federal has previously argued that CNN’s analysis is incomplete because it did not include applicants’ credit scores or information about their available cash deposits or relationship history with the lender – none of which is publicly available in the public federal data. The credit union has declined to provide CNN any data that would make it possible to analyze those factors. The credit union is “committed to engaging with policymakers on this important issue” and “we continue to work daily to help expand economic opportunity and access to credit for our diverse community of members,” the spokesperson said. But Cleaver told CNN after the meeting that McDuffie and other Navy Federal representatives “could not provide an answer” explaining the racial disparities in mortgage approvals, and that he hoped to hear more from them in the future. “We’re expecting to have another meeting with them, we’re expecting to get facts this time,” he said. Reps. Steven Horsford and Emanuel Cleaver speak to reporters after meeting with Navy Federal Credit Union CEO Mary McDuffie on Capitol Hill. CNN Horsford said that the members “asked very specific questions about the timeline” of Navy Federal’s external review, and found the responses from Navy Federal “inadequate.” “Time is of the essence, because every single day that they don’t change or update their protocols is a servicemember, and particularly a Black or Latino servicemember, who is facing denials,” he said. Navy Federal has also noted that a higher percentage of its mortgage loans go to Black borrowers than most other large lenders. But Horsford said Thursday that that excuse didn’t address “the issue of denials.” “More than 40% of our servicemembers, active duty, are people of color,” he said. “So yeah, they are one of the leading lenders and mortgage lenders for Black home loans – because they have a higher percentage of servicemembers who are their membership. It should be higher.” Several Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, including Cleaver and ranking member Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, wrote a letter last week asking the committee’s Republican chair to hold a hearing on the racial disparities in Navy Federal’s mortgage lending. And ten Democrat senators have separately asked federal regulators to examine Navy Federal’s mortgage practices, citing both CNN and a separate analysis of public mortgage data by Senate banking committee staff that also found racial disparities in its lending. Navy Federal is also facing a federal class-action lawsuit from mortgage applicants who cite CNN’s reporting and allege that the credit union discriminated against them. A judge approved a motion to consolidate three separate lawsuits against the credit union into a single case last month.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/kamala-harris-trump-nato/index.html,"US Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday called reports Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has died in a Russian prison “terrible news,” and that “Russia is responsible.” “We’ve all just received reports that Alexey Navalny has died in Russia. This is, of course, terrible news, which we are working to confirm,” Harris said as she began her remarks. She added, “If confirmed this, would be a further sign of Putin’s brutality. Whatever story they tell, let us be clear: Russia is responsible.” The Russian prison service said Friday morning that Navalny died. He had been serving multiple lengthy prison sentences for crimes that he had denied. He faced those charges after returning to Russia following treatment in Germany after being poisoned in August 2020. Navalny returned to Russia after that treatment concluded in 2021, and he was quickly arrested. Navalny had long been a point of contention between the US and Russia. Biden previously told reporters in 2021 that he warned Putin that the consequences would be “ devastating for Russia ,” if Navalny died in prison. Harris had been facing the fraught task of reassuring US allies on the world stage, as lawmakers struggle to pass aid for Ukraine and Israel and former Trump threatens to abandon NATO allies. It was another high-profile moment for Harris to address the Munich Security Conference Friday amid a consequential moment in US foreign policy, as ongoing conflicts overseas have roiled domestic politics. It came at a delicate time for the White House, which continues to grapple with the fallout of the special counsel report that called into question Biden’s mental acuity and has placed renewed focus on the vice president. But it suddenly became an opportunity for Harris to be the most prominent American voice to offer a reaction to the reports of Navalny’s death. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on NPR earlier Friday that the US was working to confirm Navalny’s death. “If it’s confirmed, it is a terrible tragedy, and given the Russian government’s long and sordid history of doing harm to its opponents, it raises real and obvious questions about what happened here,” Sullivan said. The administration had repeatedly called for Navalny’s immediate release, and CNN has reported Biden called for Navalny’s release in his first phone call with Putin after taking office in 2021. After her opening comment on Navalny, Harris transitioned into her prepared remarks that were meant to reassure American allies over the future of US foreign policy. Chief among the worries from the US’ top allies is Trump statement last weekend that he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense. After the Biden administration helped strengthen the bonds of the NATO alliance following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Trump statement is sparking real concern that he would not abide by the collective-defense clause at the heart of the alliance if reelected. During her speech, Harris launched a veiled attack against Trump, describing his foreign policy approach as “dangerous” and issuing a stark warning if the US cedes ground to Russia. “They suggest it’s in the best interest of the American people to isolate ourselves from the world, to flout common understandings among nations, to embrace dictators, and adopt the repressive tactics and abandon commitments to our allies in favor of unilateral action,” Harris said. “Let me be clear – that worldview is dangerous, destabilizing and indeed shortsighted,” she said. Trump had drawn immediate consternation last weekend for saying he would encourage Russia to invade countries who don’t meet their NATO obligations. The comment concerned not only the American foreign policy establishment but from American NATO allies, who have watched warily as Russia proceeds with its invasion of Ukraine . The former president on Wednesday said he wouldn’t defend NATO nations who don’t spend enough on defense but did not repeat his comment about encouraging Russia to do whatever they wante “I’ve been saying look, if they’re not going to pay, we’re not going to protect, OK. And Biden said, ‘Oh this is so bad, this is so terrible that he would say that.’ No, if they’re not paying their bills, and most of them weren’t when I got there,” Trump said at a campaign event in North Charleston, SouthCarolina. Harris maintained Friday that US commitment to NATO remains “ironclad” in the wake of Trump comments. It’s a similar message to the one that has been promoted by her boss this week. Biden took direct aim at his predecessor on Tuesday, pointedly accusing Trump of “bowing down” to Putin in some of his harshest criticism of his likely rival on foreign policy to date. Trump, Biden claimed, sent a “dangerous and shocking” signal with his comments, delivered during a weekend campaign rally. Concern is also rising over the ability of Washington to send more aid to Ukraine. For months, the White House’s national security supplemental request that includes billions in funding for Ukraine and Israel, among other priorities, has remained stalled in Congress over GOP infighting. The White House has repeatedly stressed the need to deliver additional funds to Ukraine, framing it as a matter of national security. Harris will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday. Harris called Putin’s war in Ukraine an “utter failure” and stressed the consequences of ceding any ground to Russia, reaffirming US support for Ukraine. “Imagine if America turned our back on Ukraine and abandoned our NATO allies and abandoned our treaty commitments. Imagine if we went easy on Putin. Let alone encouraged him,” Harris said. “History offers a clue. If we stand by while an aggressor invades its neighbor with impunity, they will keep going. In the case of Putin, that means all of Europe would be threatened. If we fail to impose severe consequences on Russia, other authoritarians across the globe would be emboldened,” Harris said.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/30/politics/trump-fraud-trial-verdict-what-to-watch-for/index.html,"NewYork state Judge Arthur Engoron has the future of Trump business empire in his hands – and we may learn that fate Friday. After a contentious 11-week trial, Engoron is poised to rule how much money Trump and his co-defendants owe for fraud as well as whether the former president can still do business in the state . He has already ruled that Trump engaged in fraud. The civil lawsuit from NewYork Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, is seeking $370 million from Trump and the other defendants. She alleges that Trump filed fraudulent financial statements that allowed him to obtain loans and insurance at more favorable rates. The trial goes to the heart of Trump image as a successful billionaire and includes accusations of fraud regarding his Trump Tower apartment, Mar-a-Lago estate and several golf courses, among other assets. Here’s what to know ahead of Friday’s expected verdict: What’s at stake James is asking for $370 million from Trump and the co-defendants in disgorgement – or ill-gotten gains. Engoron has already ruled that Trump has engaged in fraud and ordered the dissolution of his business empire, an action that is on hold pending Trump appeal. Engoron canceled business certificates for many of Trump entities in NewYork, including the Trump Organization. Engoron also called for a receiver to oversee the dissolution of the entities, which include buildings such as Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street and the Seven Springs family compound in Westchester County, NewYork. His upcoming ruling will address six additional claims including conspiracy, issuing false financial statements, falsifying business records and insurance fraud. The attorney general’s office argued in its closing presentation that Trump “acted with intent” to fraudulently inflate the value of his assets in his financial statements. “The buck stopped with him,” said Andrew Amer, a lawyer for the attorney general’s office, saying that Trump was responsible for the conduct Trump Org. executives Allen Weisselberg and Jeff McConney participated in to inflate his assets. “Mr. Trump was certainly in the loop to review and approve the statements,” Amer said. “The court should infer that he acted with intent to defraud based on his extensive knowledge about these assets. How harsh will Engoron be? The back and forth between the judge, Trump and the former president’s lawyers during the trial was repeatedly heated. Trump social media messages and comments outside the court even led to a partial gag order and fines. Engoron was quotable during the trial and in two written rulings against Trump and has not held back in criticizing the former president. “In defendants’ world: rent-regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party’s lies,” Engoron wrote in the summary judgment ruling against Trump . “That is a fantasy world, not the real world,” the judge added. And in December, the judge wrote a scathing denial of the former president’s attempt to toss the case. In the three-page opinion rejection the motion for a directed verdict to dismiss the case, Engoron said that experts called at trial by Trump attorneys were not credible and that the defense’s key arguments were unconvincing. A valuation can be based on different criteria and analyzed different ways, the judge wrote, “But a lie is still a lie.” What about the kids? In addition to banning Trump from doing business in NewYork for life, the attorney general is asking for Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, the co-CEOs of the Trump Org., to be banned from doing business in NewYork for five years. But during the closing presentations earlier this month, Engoron asked pointed questions to the attorney general’s office about whether Trump adult sons were liable for an intent to defraud and conspiracy. “What evidence do you have – I just haven’t seen it – that they knew that there was fraud?” Engoron asked. Ivanka Trump was originally named as a defendant, but claims against her were dismissed last year by an appeals court over the statute of limitations. Trump arguments Trump turned the civil trial into a series of campaign appearances, speaking to TV cameras several times each day outside of the courtroom when he was there. He has consistently framed the entire affair as a political prosecution, sought to belittle James, fought with the judge and his clerk, and accused , without proof, the attorney general and White House of colluding to keep him out of office. “This was a political witch hunt,” Trump said in a dramatic moment in court earlier this month while speaking to Engoron. “What’s happened here, sir, is a fraud on me.” Legally, Trump and his team argue that there’s no proof of an intent to defraud and that lenders were obligated to conduct their own due diligence, regardless of the valuations at the Trump Org. supplied. Furthermore, Trump says, companies like Deutsche Bank wanted to do business with Trump Org. and went into the deals with open eyes. Trump has already appealed the earlier Engoron ruling and has pledged to appeal whatever he rules here. It’s unclear how quickly any decision would be put in force as well. Gag order Trump demeanor in and out of the courtroom led to a remarkable gag order and fines issued by Engoron against the former president. Engoron and one of his clerks became the subject of “serious and credible” death threats – the judge was even “swatted” on the day of closing arguments this month. In early October, Trump posted on social media a baseless allegation about Engoron’s law clerk, leading to the gag order. The judge later extended the order to include Trump attorneys from commenting on the judge’s private communications with his law clerk. The order does not limit public criticism of Engoron, the district attorney or other parts of the case. As the trial neared an end in December, Engoron reminisced. “In a strange way, I’m gonna miss this trial,” the judge said. “It’s been an experience.” This story has been updated with the anticipated verdict timing.","['newyork', 'state', 'judge', 'arthur', 'engoron', 'future', 'trump', 'business', 'empire', 'hands', 'may', 'learn', 'fate', 'friday', 'contentious', '11week', 'trial', 'engoron',

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/former-fbi-informant-charged-biden-burisma/index.html,"Special counsel David Weiss charged a former FBI informant with lying about Biden and his son HunterBiden’s involvement in business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, undercutting a major aspect of Republican’ impeachment inquiry into the president. Alexander Smirnov, 43, is facing charges in connection with lying to the FBI and creating false records. He was arrested Thursday at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, after his arrival in the US from overseas, and will make his initial appearance in federal court Thursday afternoon. CNN is working to determine whether Smirnov has an attorney. The indictment alleges that Smirnov’s story to the FBI “was a fabrication, an amalgam of otherwise unremarkable business meetings and contacts that had actually occurred but at a later date than he claimed and for the purpose of pitching Burisma on the Defendant’s services and products, not for discussing bribes to [Biden] when he was in office.” Congressional Republican have championed Smirnov’s now-discredited allegations for roughly a year, though not by name. They fought with the FBI to obtain memos about what Smirnov told investigators and publicly released the materials over the FBI’s objections. The congressional Republican repeatedly praised Smirnov as “credible” and put his uncorroborated claims front-and-center in their impeachment inquiry into the president. While announcing the impeachment inquiry, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said “a trusted FBI informant has alleged a bribe to the Biden family.” The FBI is now using some of the same memos that congressional Republican released as part of their indictment against Smirnov. “For months we have warned that Republican have built their conspiracies about Hunter and his family on lies told by people with political agendas, not facts,” said Abbe Lowell, HunterBiden’s lawyer, in a statement to CNN. “We were right and the air is out of their balloon. This is just another instance of Chairmen Comer and Jordan peddling falsehoods based on dishonest, uncredible allegations and witnesses,” he added. House Oversight Chair James Comer said in a Thursday statement to CNN that his investigation into the president does not revolve around Smirnov or his claims made in the FD-1023 – a form the FBI uses to memorialize information gathered from confidential sources – that Republican legislators have cited. “To be clear, the impeachment inquiry is not reliant on the FBI’s FD-1023. It is based on a large record of evidence, including bank records and witness testimony, revealing that Biden knew of and participated in his family’s business dealings,” the Kentucky Republican said. He said the FBI had previously defended Smirnov’s credibility. “When asked by the committee about their confidence in the confidential human source, the FBI told the committee the confidential human source was credible and trusted, had worked with the FBI for over a decade, and had been paid six figures,” Comer added. GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who publicly released the 1023 form last year after the FBI declined to do so, said his goal has been to make the Justice Department investigate the bribery allegations against the Biden. “This indictment isn’t enough,” a Grassley spokesperson said in a statement. “The public has a right to see all the underlying evidence supporting the Biden Justice Department’s case. The Biden administration must show it’s work.” According to court records, Smirnov told an FBI agent that he had spoken with the owner of Burisma about the company’s efforts to buy a company in the United States. As part of his report to the FBI, the indictment alleges, Smirnov also noted that someone referred to as “Businessperson 1” was on the board of Burisma and was also the son of an individual referred to as “Public Official 1.” Though the indictment does not identify these individuals, sources identified “Public Official 1” as Biden and “Businessperson 1” as HunterBiden. During Biden campaign for presidency, Smirnov allegedly submitted reports to the FBI about two meetings with Burisma executives from 2015 and 2016, during which the executives admitted that they hired HunterBiden to “protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems.” Smirnov also allegedly reported that executives paid $5 million each to Joe and HunterBiden while Biden was vice president so that Hunter would “take care of all those issues through his dad,” referring to a criminal investigation being conducted by the then-Ukrainian prosecutor general into Burisma. “In truth and fact, the Defendant had contact with executives from Burisma in 2017, after the end of the Obama-Biden Administration and after the then Ukrainian Prosecutor General had been fired in February 2016, in other words, when [Biden] had no ability to influence U.S. policy and when the Prosecutor General was no longer in office,” the indictment states. It continues, “In short, the Defendant transformed his routine and unextraordinary business contacts with Burisma in 2017 and later into bribery allegations against [Biden], the presumptive nominee of one of the two major political parties for President, after expressing bias against [Biden] and his candidacy.” This story has been updated with additional details","['special', 'counsel', 'david',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-backed-chinese-firm-razing-trees-in-michigan-to-make-way-for-ev-plant,"Former CIA Director Leon Panetta warns that China may use Michigan EV plant for espionage Leon Panetta told lawmakers that a proposed electric vehicle battery plant in Michigan could be used for Chinese espionage. A Chinese green energy firm backed by Michigan's state government is tearing down trees to make way for a proposed electric vehicle battery plant designed to help the state meet its climate goals. Gotion Inc. — whose parent company is Hefei, China-based Gotion High-Tech — said it has initiated its tree-cutting process this week to make way for its controversial EV project in Mecosta County, Michigan, which has received support from Democrat and climate activists, but opposition from Republican and national security experts. The firm said the process is legal and pushed back against concerns raised by locals. ""It’s unfortunate that some extremist groups have targeted Mecosta County area businesses that want to work with Gotion Inc. to grow and strengthen jobs in our region,"" said Chuck Thelen, Gotion’s vice president of North American operations. ""A small minority of people continue to spread misinformation and manufacture lies about Gotion Inc., which invariably leads some residents to act out and make threats,"" he continued. ""Despite these attempts at intimidation, the legal selective cutting of trees will start on Feb. 14."" FORD PLANS TO HIRE CHINESE MILITARY SOFTWARE SUPPLIER FOR EV FACTORY IN US: GOP INVESTIGATORS Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer delivers her State of the State address to a joint session of the House and Senate on January 24 in Lansing, Michigan. Gotion first unveiled its development plans for the project in October 2022 alongside Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer , agreeing to invest $2.4 billion in two 550,000-square-foot production plants and other supporting facilities across a large plot of land in Green Charter Township. Then, in August, the firm purchased 270 acres of land for the project, including land zoned for industrial, agricultural and residential use. However, amid increasing opposition to the project over Gotion's ties to the Chinese Communist Party , the project has faced delays even as the Whitmer administration has earmarked nearly $200 million in taxpayer funding for the development. While mass tree-cutting to make way for construction was originally slated to occur late last year, the process was delayed until this week. 120 REPUBLICANS JOIN EFFORT OPPOSING Biden'S 'DE FACTO EV MANDATE' Crain's Detroit Business reported earlier this week that one local logging business had been awarded the contract but ultimately backed out over the sustained local opposition, saying they didn't want to be ""tied up in a bunch of gobbledygook."" The opposition appears to have been spearheaded, in part, by Marjorie Steele, the founder of the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance of Michigan. Li Zhen, the founder and chairman of Gotion High Tech, speaks during the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, on November 10, 2023. Gotion High-Tech's corporate bylaws say the company is required to ""carry out Party activities in accordance with the Constitution of the Communist Party of China."" ""To date, Gotion has applied for no environmental permits through EGLE, no soil erosion permits through the county, and has presented no site plan to local or state agencies. Yet Gotion is preparing to log the site before the end of the month,"" Steele wrote to the local U.S. Environmental Protection Agency office last month. ""This environmental situation is about to come to a head,"" she continued. ""We as representatives of the local community ask once more, urgently, that EPA Region 5’s offices take action on the federal oversight required of this development, before violations occur."" 17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON Biden'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH In a statement to Fox News Digital, Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy spokesperson Jeff Johnston confirmed that Gotion has yet to file any permit applications with the agency regarding its project or tree-cutting plans. However, he said that permits are only required if the work is to be done on wetlands. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer engages in a conversation with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, left, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, center, on September 19, 2023, in NewYork City. Gotion has developed plans in both Michigan and Illinois. ""Cutting trees does not require a permit from EGLE if the cutting does not occur within a regulated wetland,"" Johnston said. In addition to locals, the project has received pushback from state and federal lawmakers, in addition to national security experts. In a House hearing last month, former CIA Directors Leon Panetta and Mike Pompeo warned that Gotion's project could be covertly used by Chinese assets for espionage. Jonathan Lindsey and Lana Theis demanded the Whitmer administration to halt funding for the project in light of the concerns raised by Panetta and Pompeo. ""National security experts from both sides of the aisle have sounded the alarm about China’s attempts to infiltrate and compromise our safety through industrial espionage,"" Lindsey said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Yet, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer continues to ignore their warnings and further place our state and nation at risk — while using taxpayer dollars to do so.""

EXCLUSIVE: House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio , cheered the news that multiple major U.S. banks and financial institutions are leaving a $68 trillion climate alliance founded at the United Nations. In a series of unexpected announcements on Thursday, JPMorgan Chase, the world's largest bank, and State Street Global Advisors, an institutional investor with $3.5 trillion in assets under management, withdrew from the so-called Climate Action 100+ investor group. At the same time, BlackRock, which has more than $10 trillion in assets under management, dramatically scaled back its involvement in the alliance. ""This is great news because you're supposed to make investment decisions based on just good common business sense, your fiduciary responsibility to your investors, not based on left-wing woke politics,"" Jordan told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""So, yeah, this is a win for America, a win for the economy, a win for Americans and investors and, more importantly, it's a win for freedom."" ""The folks who are involved in these banks are smart people, successful people. They've done well. I think deep down they know decisions should be based on the market, on principles of capitalism, not on politics,"" he added. CONSUMER GROUP REVEALS LEFT-WING GROUPS INCREASINGLY USING COURTS TO PUSH GREEN NEW DEAL Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, has led an investigation into major banks and nonprofit climate groups over their coordination on net-zero ambitions. Under Jordan's leadership, the House Judiciary Committee launched a sprawling investigation into what he dubbed the ""climate-obsessed corporate ‘cartel’"" in December 2022 as Republican prepared to take majority control of the chamber. The panel's main objective has been to probe whether the financial sector, aided by nonprofit activist climate groups, are violating U.S. antitrust laws. As part of the initial effort, Jordan and several fellow House Republican penned a letter to the Steering Committee for Climate Action 100+, demanding information about the coalition’s network of influence. The letter stated that the alliance ""seems to work like a cartel to ‘ensure the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take necessary action on climate change.’"" BILLIONAIRE-FUELED ROCKEFELLER FUND COORDINATED CLIMATE LAWSUITS WITH DEM STATE AG: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS Since then, Jordan's committee has expanded the investigation, firing off inquiries into BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, in addition to nonprofits Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. And late last year he issued subpoenas to BlackRock and State Street, compelling the production of documents related to his investigation into potential antitrust violations. ""I think we've done more subpoenas and more interviews and written more letters than probably most of the rest of Congress combined,"" Jordan told Fox News Digital. ""We have been pushing for stopping this kind of coordination and collusion that we think is harmful to the economy, to freedom, to investors,"" the Judiciary Committee chair continued. ""So, you know, we're just doing our job, and we're happy to see that three huge banks — the decision they made today, and I think, as I said before, it's a win for the country."" Activists stage a protest outside BlackRock headquarters in NewYork City on May 25, 2022. Climate Action 100+ was formally established in December 2017 at the United Nations as a way of aligning the world's largest private sector financiers of greenhouse gas emitters . Since the association was created, it has grown to include more than 700 financial institutions that are collectively responsible for a staggering $68 trillion in assets under management. The group, which is overseen by a nongovernmental steering committee comprised of ESG activists, calls for members to engage companies on ""improving climate change governance,"" curbing carbon emissions and strengthening climate-related financial disclosure policies. Its actions have largely taken aim at investments that benefit the oil and gas industry while boosting green energy investment strategies. MEET THE LITTLE-KNOWN GROUP FUNDED BY LEFT-WING DARK MONEY THAT IS SHAPING FEDERAL CLIMATE POLICY But in June 2023, Climate Action 100+ unveiled its ""phase 2"" strategy, which calls for member investors to actively engage with companies to reduce their carbon footprint. That program, slated to be implemented in the coming months, sparked concerns from State Street and BlackRock. ""After careful review, State Street Global Advisors has concluded the enhanced Climate Action 100+ Phase 2 requirements for signatories will not be consistent with our independent approach to proxy voting and portfolio company engagement,"" State Street Global Advisors said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""As a result, we have decided to withdraw from Climate Action 100+."" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, left, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink BlackRock similarly said in a note Thursday that the ""phase 2"" strategy caused it to withdraw its U.S. business from Climate Action 100+ in recent weeks, instead shifting involvement in the alliance to its smaller international entity where a majority of clients are pursuing decarbonization goals. ""This new strategy will require signatories to make an overarching commitment to use client assets to pursue emissions reductions in investee companies through stewardship engagement,"" the firm stated. ""In our judgment, making this new commitment across our assets under management would raise legal considerations, particularly in the U.S."" ""The majority of the firm’s clients who are seeking investment solutions that help them meet their climate, transition and decarbonization commitments are clients of our international businesses,"" it added. ""To align with these clients and funds, we have transferred our membership in CA100+ to BlackRock International. BlackRock Inc. is no longer a member of CA100+."" UNITED NATIONS FOUNDATION IS QUIETLY FUELING CLIMATE POLICY, FUNDING STAFF IN DEM STATES And JPMorgan Chase separately explained that it quit the global investor group because of the expansion of its own in-house sustainability team and the establishment of its climate-risk framework in recent years. The most recent United Nations climate summit took place in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in late November and early December last year. The conference included various agreements from financial institutions to curb investments in the fossil fuel sector. Climate Action 100+, in addition to other global climate alliances and investor networks, has also drawn the ire of Republican states , which have argued that their activities may infringe on government policymaking. They have also warned that such associations are harming domestic energy companies that employ thousands of Americans and ensure low consumer prices. As a result, state attorneys general, financial officers and agriculture commissioners have banded together in recent months to threaten legal action related to nonprofit climate alliances and banks' involvement in such groups. ""Since its inception, Climate Action 100+ has experienced remarkable growth — and that has only continued.""

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-democrats-unveil-immigration-border-reform-plan-crisis-pivotal-election-issue,"House Democrat group unveils plan for border, immigration reform New Democrat Coalition Chair Annie Kuster held a press conference on Thursday to unveil her group's own border security and immigration framework. A group of House Democrat is unveiling their own plan for border security and immigration reform, another sign the left is gradually growing to embrace discussions of how to solve the U.S. migrant crisis. The New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of nearly 100 lawmakers that bills itself as ""center-left,"" revealed a framework that called for increased manpower at the southern border and within immigration courts, as well as more pathways for legal residency and citizenship for workers, ""Dreamers"" and others. Among other measures, the plan would permanently authorize a program to allow international medical students studying in the U.S. to legally stay in the country after completing their degrees. It would also expand legal pathways for migrant farmworkers and establish a new non-immigrant work visa category for U.S. industries experiencing personnel shortages. It also would include a legal pathway for people who came here illegally but have been working and paying taxes for at least five years, provided they pay a fine and pass a criminal background check. REPUBLICANS PROBE DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER ROLE IN HOUSING MIGRANTS ON FEDERAL LANDS New Democrat Coalition Chair Annie Kuster unveiled her group's plan for an immigration and border security overhaul. On the enforcement front, the plan called for increasing the number of border agents at ports of entry by at least 500 and increasing some Customs and Border Protection officers’ pay. The Democrat framework would also create an independent judiciary system for immigration courts and increase the number of judges to cut down on the current backlog of cases. To manage the flow of migrants coming to the U.S. to be processed for asylum, it would also create ""new regional processing centers"" in South and Central America where migrants are granted interviews and their cases begin to be taken up. They would be considered for lawful entry to ""participating nations"" like Canada and Spain, in addition to the U.S. It’s part of an overall shift among figures in the Democrat Party that’s seen top mainstream liberals concede the need to overhaul the U.S. immigration system. REPUBLICANS PROBE DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER ROLE IN HOUSING MIGRANTS ON FEDERAL LANDS Rep.-elect Tom Suozzi won a critical victory for Democrat largely by shunning progressive politics and focusing on the border and local issues. On Tuesday, Rep.-elect Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., won a closely watched special election to succeed expelled Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., after empathizing with voter concerns about the border . Both parties funneled millions of dollars into the race, but Suozzi delivered the critical victory for his party – and shrunk the House GOP majority – by running a campaign that largely shunned progressive ideals. ""Their candidate ran like a Republican. He sounded like a Republican talking about the border and immigration because everybody knows that's the top issue,"" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said of Suozzi during a Wednesday press conference. A recent Fox News poll found that nearly eight in 10 voter think the border is a significant issue – 34% said it was an emergency and 45% said it was a major problem. border security. He’s called the border situation a ""crisis"" multiple times and even vowed to shut down the border if Congress granted him the power to do so, which angered his progressive allies . Biden said the border was in ""crisis"" in April 2021, but the White House walked back his statement at the time.

Krysten Sinema and Rep. Ruben Gallego in a new 30-second ad. Credit: NRSC Sen. Kyrsten Sinema spent over $200,000 on taxpayer-funded private flights since 2020 despite previously backing legislation to ""hold Congress accountable"" for luxury air travel. During this time, however, the independent Arizona senator did not hold a single public town hall with constituents. Sinema has faced scrutiny over the use of the money from her Senate office budget on private air travel for her and her team members, including $116,000 in 2023 alone, according to past reports and figures verified by Fox News Digital. The senator's spokesperson defended the taxpayer-backed trips by saying that the funds had been used to maximize her time with constituents in her state. DEM LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TIKTOK ACCOUNT, AFTER SUGGESTING THE PLATFORM ‘MAY BE’ A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT ""Arizonans know it can take hours to get from Prescott to Yuma,"" the spokesperson told the Arizona Republic in a written statement. ""Senator Sinema maximizes her time in Arizona to connect with as many constituents in every corner of the state as possible."" SINEMA HIT WITH ETHICS COMPLAINT OVER ALLEGED FAILURE TO DETAIL FINANCES IN DISCLOSURE: ‘HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS’ Although the spokesperson said the private flights had been used to ""connect with as many constituents"" as possible, Sinema did not hold a single town hall open to the public as she burned through taxpayer cash on air travel. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema has not said if she will seek re-election in 2024. Sinema has participated in some tele-town halls over the years, but according to her website, the only in-person visit was to Honeywell in 2022, a group that has donated $75,000 to the senator's Get Stuff Done PAC. That town hall, however, was only open to employees of the company and closed to the public. Rep. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat running for Sinema's seat in 2024, has hit the senator several times for her lack of town halls. On April 1st, commonly known as April Fools' Day, Gallego posted a pretend flyer for what appeared to be a Sinema town hall. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.,is running for the Arizona Senate in 2024. ""Glad to see Kyrsten Sinema finally holding a town hall in Arizona,"" the Democrat posted on X. ""Arizonans deserve a senator who will meet with them."" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sinema used the taxpayer cash on private flights despite previously supporting legislation to hold Congress accountable for luxury travel. In 2017, she openly supported the No Ongoing Perks Enrichment Act, which sought ""to prohibit the use of funds provided for the official travel expenses of Members of Congress and other officers and employees of the legislative branch for first-class airline accommodations.""

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-endorsed-ohio-senate-candidate-bernie-moreno-blasts-biden-far-overdue-visit-east-palestine,"Ohio GOP Senate Candidate Bernie Moreno: ‘Traitor’ Mayorkas ‘absolutely’ should be impeached Moreno told Fox News Digital that Mayorkas is ""grotesquely unqualified"" for the job and has ""not followed the laws of the land."" FIRST ON FOX: Ohio U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno took aim at Biden on Friday for his planned visit to East Palestine, Ohio, insisting his trip to the region is ""far overdue"" after a hazardous train derailment last year sent the community's residents into peril. ""Biden's visit to East Palestine is far overdue. While this administration and Democrat in the Senate have been focused on giving endless aid to Ukraine while neglecting our own nation, citizens of East Palestine have paid the price,"" Moreno told Fox News Digital. ""I hope that Biden's visit will inspire him to confront challenges that Americans are dealing with every day rather than continuing to fund endless wars abroad,"" he added. Biden's visit, which was announced last month by the White House, comes more than a year after the train derailment shook the rural Ohio village , which is located in Columbiana County on the state's border with Pennsylvania. Trump ALLY MORENO PICKS UP NOEM ENDORSEMENT, RISES TO TOP OHIO REPUBLICAN VYING TO BOOT DEMOCRAT SHERROD BROWN ""I hope that Biden's visit will inspire him to confront challenges that Americans are dealing with every day rather than continuing to fund endless wars abroad,"" Ohio U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno told Fox News Digital. Last month, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked whether Biden still had plans to visit East Palestine. She told reporters, ""The president will visit when it's most helpful to the community."" East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway told Fox last month that he believed the ""best time"" for Biden to travel to the village ""would be February of 2025, when he is on his book tour."" Conaway additionally told Fox, ""The president is always welcome to our town,"" adding, ""that being said, I don’t know what he would do here now."" Biden had claimed in September that he simply had not had time with his busy schedule to visit the Ohio town. Biden's lack of a visit came in contrast to former Trump , who met with residents of East Palestine on Feb. 22, 2023, just weeks after the incident. Joining him was Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio. Former Trump looks at Little Beaver Creek and water pumps as he visits East Palestine, Ohio, following the Feb. 3 Norfolk Southern freight train derailment on Feb. 22, 2023, in East Palestine, Ohio. ""You are not forgotten. We stand with you. We pray for you. And we will stand with you and your fight to help ensure the accountability that you deserve,"" Trump told the crowd at the time. ""The community has shown the tough and resilient heart of America. And that's what it is. This is really America right here. We're standing in America."" A successful Cleveland-based businessman and luxury auto dealership giant, Moreno launched his second straight bid for U.S. Senate in Ohio last April, touting himself as an outsider and a conservative. TED CRUZ MAKES ENDORSEMENT IN KEY BATTLEGROUND SENATE RACE: 'BERNIE MORENO HAS WHAT IT TAKES' In December, Moreno's candidacy in the race was endorsed by Trump . ""It’s time for the entire Republican Party to UNITE around Bernie’s campaign for Senate, so that we can have a BIG victory in what will be the most important Election in American History,"" Trump wrote on TRUTH Social at the time. ""Bernie is the Father of wonderful Emily, the wife of outstanding young Ohio Congressman, Max Miller. Bernie is Strong on the Border, Crime, Cutting Taxes, Election Integrity, the Military / Vets, and will always protect our under siege 2nd Amendment."" Furthering his remarks, Trump insisted that Moreno ""will be an outstanding United States Senator, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement—He will never let you down."" Bernie Moreno is acknowledged at a rally with former Trump at the Delaware County Fairgrounds on April 23, 2022, in Delaware, Ohio. In a second post, Trump went on to say, ""Bernie Moreno, a highly respected businessman from the GREAT State of Ohio, is exactly the type of MAGA fighter that we need in the United States Senate. Bernie will always stand up to the Fascist ‘nut jobs’ and the spineless RINOS in order to fight the corrupt Deep State that is destroying our Country."" ""Remember, we need a successful political outsider like Bernie to defeat Liberal career politician, Sherrod Brown, who has so poorly represented Ohio, and pretends that he’s all for the Policies of your Favorite President, Donald J. Trump, but then gets to the Senate and vote 100% for the horrendous Policies of Crooked Biden, the worst President in the History of our Country,"" Trump added. Trump's endorsement will likely give Moreno an advantage over other Republican primary candidates , including Frank LaRose, who serves as Ohio’s secretary of state, and state Sen. Matt Dolan. The winner of the March 19 GOP primary election will challenge incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown — the only Democrat to win statewide in Ohio in the past decade. Brown will be heavily targeted by Republican in a state that was once a premiere general election battleground but has shifted red over the past six years. Moreno, an immigrant who arrived in the U.S. legally from Colombia with his family as a 5-year-old boy, made border security a top issue during his 2022 Senate campaign and visited the U.S.-Mexico border. He suspended his campaign in February last year","['ohio', 'gop', 'senate', 'candidate', 'bernie', 'moreno', '‘traitor’', 'mayorkas', '‘absolutely’', 'impeached', 'moreno', 'mayorkas', 'grotesquely',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-calls-for-an-end-to-impeachment-inquiry-after-indictment-fbi-informant-outrageous-effort,"People have already made a decision about Biden's fitness for office: Karl Rove Fox News contributor Karl Rove discusses recent reporting that Biden, not Robert Hur, brought up Beau Biden during the special counsel's probe. Biden called for House Republican to drop their impeachment inquiry against him, saying on Friday that it has been ""an outrageous effort from the beginning."" The president’s comments came after the indictment of FBI informant who alleged that Biden and HunterBiden had been paid millions of dollars in exchange for their help firing the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings. ""He is lying, and it should be dropped,"" Biden said after a reporter asked about the indicted FBI informant. House Republican told Fox News Digital that their impeachment inquiry has much more evidence that does not rely on the indicted FBI source. FBI INFORMANT CHARGED WITH GIVING FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT HUNTER Biden IN 2020 Special Counsel David Weiss charged Alexander Smirnov, 43, with making a false statement and creating a false and fictitious record during FBI interviews. According to the indictment, Smirnov gave ""false derogatory information"" to the FBI despite ""repeated admonishments that he must provide truthful information and that he must not fabricate evidence."" The indictment says that Smirnov had told an FBI agent in March 2017 that he had had a phone call with Burisma’s owner concerning the firm potentially acquiring a U.S. company and making an initial public offering on a U.S.-based stock exchange. In reporting this conversation to the FBI agent, Smirnov said that HunterBiden was a board member of Burisma, though that was publicly known. In June 2020, Smirnov is accused of having told the FBI, for the first time, about two meetings he had had four to five years earlier, in which executives associated with Burisma had supposedly admitted that they had hired HunterBiden to ""protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."" Biden at the White House on December 13, 2023, in Washington, D.C. During this meeting, the indictment alleges that Smirnov said the executives had paid $5 million to each of the Biden while Biden was still in office. The indictment alleges that Smirnov falsely claimed that the Biden had been paid so that HunterBiden, with his dad’s help, could take care of a criminal investigation being conducted by the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General, Viktor Shokin, into Burisma. Biden, NOT SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR, BROUGHT UP SON'S DEATH IN QUESTIONING The allegations were recorded on an FBI FD-1023 form, which is used by FBI agents to record unverified reporting from confidential human sources. The form is used to document information as told to an FBI agent, but recording that information does not validate or weigh it against other information known by the FBI. The FD-1023 form containing the allegations last year became a key document in the House investigation into the Biden family’s business dealings. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley were approached by a whistleblower last summer who alleged that the FBI was in possession of a document — an FD-1023 form, dated June 30, 2020 — that explicitly detailed information provided by a confidential human source alleging that Biden, while serving as vice president, had been involved in a multi-million-dollar scheme with a foreign national in exchange for influence over policy decisions. Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., arrives for the House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing titled ""Unsuitable Litigation: Oversight of Third-Party Litigation Funding"" in the Rayburn Building on Wednesday, September 13, 2023. On Friday, Biden was asked about the indictment of Smirnov—and whether it should bring the impeachment inquiry to an end. ""He is lying, and it should be dropped,"" Biden said, referring to Smirnov’s allegations and the impeachment inquiry. ""It’s just been a — it's been an outrageous effort from the beginning."" HunterBiden’s attorney Abbe Lowell, earlier Friday, said the same: ""For months we have warned that Republican have built their conspiracies about Hunter and his family on lies told by people with political agendas, not facts. We were right, and the air is out of their balloon,"" Lowell said in a statement. ""This is just another instance of Chairmen Comer and Jordan peddling falsehoods based on dishonest, uncredible allegations and witnesses."" But Comer, who is leading the impeachment inquiry, said that the FBI's FD-1023 form containing Smirnov’s is not being used in an impeachment inquiry against the president. SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT HUR TO TESTIFY PUBLICLY AT HOUSE HEARING ON Biden CLASSIFIED RECORDS PROBE The impeachment inquiry, he said, ""is based on a large record of evidence, including bank records and witness testimony, revealing that Biden knew of and participated in his family’s business dealings."" HunterBiden, son of US Biden, speaks to members of the media outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, December 13, 2023. ""We have over $30 million reasons to continue this investigation and not one of those reasons relies on the corrupt FBI or an informant. Bank records don’t lie,"" Comer told Fox News Digital on Friday. ""Bank records and witness testimony reveal Biden knew about and participated in his family’s business schemes, and he has repeatedly lied to the American people about these facts."" Comer added: ""The American people demand the truth and accountability for any wrongdoing. Both testimonies will take place behind closed doors. Smirnov is accused of repeating some of his false claims during an interview with FBI agents in September 2023, while changing other bits of information, and promoting a new false narrative after claiming to have met with Russian officials. If convicted, Smirnov faces a maximum of 25 years in prison","['people', 'already', 'made', 'decision', 'bidens', 'fitness', 'office', 'karl', 'rove', 'contributor', 'karl', 'rove', 'discusses',

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kids-online-safety-act-reintroduced-in-senate-with-major-support-from-biden-schumer,"Lawmakers rail against social media CEOs, but is there any regulation in sight? Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle on Capitol Hill agreed that Big Tech CEOs have not enough to safeguard children on social media following Senate hearing. Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., reintroduced the Kids Online Safety Act with more than half of the Senate's backing, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, suggesting that the bill will be filibuster-proof when it comes to the floor. On Thursday, Blackburn and Blumenthal announced that the revised bill had 62 senators on board, split evenly between both parties. If passed, it would be one of the largest Big Tech crackdowns in recent years, restricting content for minors that promotes substance abuse, the promotion of suicide, sexual exploitation and alcohol abuse. It would also mandate social media companies to implement certain controls to limit screen time, ban restrictive features and limit access to potentially harmful user profiles. ""This overwhelming bipartisan support for the Kids Online Safety Act—62 total co-sponsors, Democrat and Republican —reflects the powerful voices of young people and parents who want Congress to act,"" lawmakers said in a joint statement. HUNDREDS OF PARENTS DEMAND SCHUMER TAKE ACTION ON CHILD SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY BILL: 'PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE' A finger pointing to Messenger mobile app displayed on a smartphone screen alongside that of X,Whatsapp,Facebook,TikTok,Threads, on August 15, 2023, in Brussels, Belgium. The fresh legislation comes just a few weeks after the CEOs of Discord, Snap, TikTok, X and Meta testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to discuss online child safety. It also addresses conerns raised by groups who opposed the legislation when it was first rolled out last year due to what they believed would be harmful to LGBTQ+ children. GLAAD, a nonprofit LGBTQ+ advocacy group, and the Human Rights Campaign both rescinded their previous opposition to the bill. ""The recent watershed hearing with Big Tech CEOs showcased the urgent need for reform. With new changes to strengthen the bill and growing support, we should seize this moment to take action. We must listen to the kids, parents, experts, and advocates, and finally hold Big Tech accountable by passing the Kids Online Safety Act into law,"" lawmakers said. Biden urged lawmakers last year, when it was first introduced, to pass the bill. GRAHAM TELLS ZUCKERBERG, 'YOU HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS,' AUDIENCE CHEERS Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, apologizes to families who have been harmed due to unsafe social media during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled ""Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis."" Schumer, who also faced pressure this month from hundreds of family members who blamed social media for the death of their children, said in a statement that he looks ""forward"" to collaborate on a ""bipartisan basis"" to advance the bill. The Kids Online Safety Act will require social media companies to design their products with the safety of kids and teens in mind, provide parents tools to protect their kids and give families more options for managing and disconnecting from these platforms. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis with Senators Blumenthal and Blackburn to advance this bill in the Senate,"" BIG TECH FACES BRUTAL QUESTIONING ON CAPITOL HILL OVER CONTENT HARMING KIDS Earlier this month, the youngest victim whose relatives signed a letter to Schumer urging his support for the bill, was eight-year-old Lalani Erika Walton, of Texas.

""The President of the United States must demonstrate sound mental abilities, regardless of gender, age, or political party, which you have not."" Biden BLISTERED BY MAINSTREAM MEDIA AFTER ‘DISASTER’ PRESS CONFERENCE Texas GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician, left, is again calling on Biden to take a cognitive exam. It comes as Biden critics continue to seize on a recent report by special counsel Robert Hur regarding the president’s handling of classified documents before he took office. Hur’s 388-page report cleared Biden of wrongdoing despite having ""willfully retained and disclosed classified materials."" Hur said Biden came off ""as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"" and that ""it would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him-by then a former president well into his eighties-of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness."" Biden and his allies have aggressively pushed back on Hur's assessment and denied his age being an issue. Biden LASHES OUT AT REPORTERS ASKING ABOUT AGE CONCERNS AFTER SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT The GOP lawmakers wrote to him, ""If you are too mentally impaired to stand trial, as your own Department of Justice claims, then we are concerned that your mental state is not at a competent level to serve as the leader of the free world. Therefore, we call on you to submit to a clinically validated cognitive screening assessment and make those results available to the public."" This is the fifth such request by Jackson. He said his previous four inquiries went unanswered. ""This is the fifth time we’ve sent a letter to the White House demanding Biden take a cognitive exam, however while the administration has chosen to ignore each of these requests, it is becoming clearer each day that the President is not cognitively fit,"" Jackson told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""I am proud to be joined by Conference Chairwoman Stefanik, Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler and dozens of my House colleagues in this effort."" Special counsel Robert Hur cast doubt on Biden's memory in his 388-page report on the president's handling of classified documents. The GOP lawmakers' letter continued, ""Over the past three years, your mental decline and forgetfulness has become even more apparent. It is a common occurrence to see you shuffling your feet, stumbling while walking, slurring your words, forgetting names, losing your train of thought, and appearing confused or asleep when making public appearances here at home and on the world stage."" They pointed out that Biden recently confused French President Emmanuel Macron with a predecessor who died decades prior, and that he also mixed up German leaders’ names and mistakenly referred to the president of Egypt as the president of Mexico. SPECIAL COUNSEL CALLS Biden 'SYMPATHETIC, WELL-MEANING, ELDERLY MAN WITH A POOR MEMORY,' BRINGS NO CHARGES ""While the prevalence of your ‘gaffes’ continues to increase and creates a serious national security concern, President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party continue to modernize their military at an alarming rate while showing a clear indication of an intent to invade Taiwan in the near future,"" the letter said. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden would not be taking a cognitive test in his upcoming physical exam. Nick Riviera, a character from ""The Simpsons"" known for poor medical practices and maiming patients. The White House sent another image of ""Dr. Nick"" when reached by Fox News Digital on Friday morning. Earlier this week, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Biden would not be taking a cognitive test as part of his regular physical exam.

Ted Cruz Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, discusses the crisis at the southern border and his 2024 re-election campaign on 'Hannity.' EXCLUSIVE: Republican senators are urging the Biden administration to immediately reverse what they call a ""racist"" and ""anti-American"" policy for distributing CHIPS Act grants before it violates the law. The top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, Ranking Member Ted Cruz, R-Texas , and members Sens. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo, penned a letter exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo about the agency’s guidance stating it would consider the race of an applicant’s suppliers when awarding CHIPS Act funding. The senators say that policy is a clear violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution , Title VI, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The guidance requires applicants to document ""how the applicant intends to address the inclusion of … minority-owned business … through a supplier diversity plan"" with ""measurable targets,"" including how much money it plans to spend on ""minority-owned"" suppliers by 2030. 'THE VIEW' CO-HOSTS CLASH OVER WHETHER AMERICA IS A RACIST COUNTRY: 'CAN’T DISMISS MY LIVED EXPERIENCE' Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, during vote in the U.S. Capitol Dec. 5, 2023. The guidance also explains that the Commerce Department will consider an applicant’s diversity plan as part of the merit review process and access that plan based on the applicant’s strategy for engaging with minority-owned businesses and ""commitment to tracking and disclosing disaggregated data on supplier diversity and contractor/subcontractor diversity."" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo testifies before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies during a hearing on expanding broadband access on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Feb. 1, 2022. Cruz told Fox News Digital the Biden administration’s decision to ""dole out CHIPS funding based on the skin color of an applicant’s supply chain is racist and anti-American."" ""I’m calling on the Commerce Department to immediately rescind its unconstitutional policy,"" Cruz said. ""If it fails to do so, it will most certainly face fierce opposition in the courts."" KENTUCKY SENATE APPROVES BILL TO CURB DEI INITIATIVES AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act was signed into law in 2022 and works to strengthen American manufacturing, supply chains and national security. In their letter to Raimondo, the senators warned that the policy is ""illegal"" and urged the secretary to ""withdraw it before it causes real harm."" Senator JD Vance, R-Ohio, during a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., June 22, 2023. ""The Department’s Guidance intentionally treats certain applicants worse than others on the ground of the race of their suppliers. Title VI forbids such discrimination,"" they wrote. ""In addition to instructing the federal government to violate the law, the Guidance also encourages private businesses to discriminate on the basis of race in violation of federal law, specifically Section 1981,"" they continued. ""Section 1981 makes it illegal for private companies to discriminate on the basis of race when making and enforcing contracts."" Sen.

The Justice Department defended Special Counsel Robert Hur's report on Biden saying it was ""consistent with legal requirements and Department policy"" after the White House sent a pointed letter to the agency. In the letter, obtained by Fox News, Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer defended the Hur report and its release to the public as being ""consistent"" with the DOJ's policy, and its legal requirements. ""Having carefully considered your arguments, the Department concludes that the report as submitted to the Attorney General, and its release, are consistent with legal requirements and Department policy,"" the letter, which was sent to White House Counsel Ed Siskel and Personal Counsel to Biden Bob Bauer, said. Biden, NOT SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR, BROUGHT UP SON'S DEATH IN QUESTIONING U.S. Biden exits the White House on his way to Marine One on the South Lawn July 6, 2023 in Washington, DC. Weinsheimer noted that the fall-out surrounding the release of Hur's report on the president's memory was not ""gratuitous"" or ""unduly prejudicial."" ""The identified language is neither gratuitous nor unduly prejudicial because it is not offered to criticize or demean the President,"" the letter noted. ""Rather, it is offered to explain Special Counsel Hur's conclusions about the President's state of mind in possessing and retaining classified information."" Special Counsel Robert Hurs report calling out President Biden ""poor memory"" sparked newfound media coverage of the leaders mental capacity in office. The associate deputy attorney general also pushed back against the White House's claims that the report ""inappropriately commented"" on Biden's conduct with classified documents. ""Your claim that Special Counsel Hur inappropriately commented on uncharged conduct is misplaced,"" Weinsheimer wrote. ""As an initial matter, as described above, rather than commenting on uncharged conduct, Special Counsel Hur was applying the evidence he gathered to the applicable law."" KJP DISMISSES REPORTER'S QUERY ON Biden'S PROMISE TO SPEAK TO PRESS, CLAIMS HE ALREADY ‘TOOK QUESTIONS’ ""Special Counsel Hur's report provides significant detail on the basis of his declination decisions. This includes factors that support his determination o f whether the President knew he possessed classified information and whether he acted willfully in possessing and retaining it,"" he said. ""The language to which you object goes directly to these issues,"" Weinsheimer said. This image from Special Council Robert Hur’s investigation released by the Department of Justice on Thursday, February 8, 2024 shows Biden inside the front office and executive assistant’s desk in December 2016. Since Hur's report, which was released last Thursday, the White House has pushed back against the findings that characterized Biden as an ""elderly man with a poor memory."" Biden has also been vocal about the report's findings, lashing out that he ""did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died."" ""How the h--- dare he raise that,' Biden yelled during a press conference on Tuesday. 'Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn't any of their d--- business.""

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-win-seat-republicans-win-impeachment-two-presidents-clash-over-nato,"Dems flipping NY House seat threatens GOP majority Fox News’ Bryan Llenas reports on Democrat Tom Suozzi's victory in the NewYork special election to fill former Rep. George Santos’ seat. If the second attempt to impeach the Homeland Security chief had taken place a short time later, the Republican would have failed again. Instead, they managed to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas–the first sitting Cabinet secretary to draw that sanction–by a single vote. But after a victory in George Santos’ old district, the Democrat would have had the extra vote to stop the impeachment. Trump NATO COMMENTS TRIGGER FIERCE MEDIA AND EUROPEAN OPPOSITION: HOW SERIOUS IS HE? Tom Suozzi beat Republican Mazi Pilip in Tuesday’s special election on Long Island, unleashing a tidal wave of punditry about his winning formula–openly tackling such issues as illegal migration and crime rather than avoiding them. I always caution against drawing sweeping conclusions in one-off local races, and this election in a snowstorm is no exception. Former U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi, Democrat candidate for NewYork's 3rd congressional district, speaks at his election night party Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2024, in Woodbury, N.Y. The underlying factor was Santos, the outlandish, lying, fabricating lawmaker who won the seat with a made-up resume, was expelled by the House and is under indictment. Voters felt hosed by the Republican publicity hound, and maybe the Dems were more motivated to vote. Sure, Suozzi deserves credit for seizing on illegal migration and crime rather than avoiding such explosive issues – and doggedly distancing himself from Biden. But he also has to run again in the fall. NATO CHIEF SAYS Trump CRITICISM 'DOES UNDERMINE THE SECURITY OF ALL OF US' Trump, for his part, blamed Pilip, ""running in a race where she didn’t endorse me and tried to ‘straddle the fence,’ when she would have easily WON if she understood anything about MODERN DAY politics in America…I STAYED OUT OF THE RACE, ‘I WANT TO BE LOVED!’"" A subtle Valentine’s Day message? Republican presidential hopeful and former US Trump looks on, flanked by son Eric Trump and daughter-in-law Lara Trump, during an Election Night Party in Nashua, New Hampshire, on January 23, 2024. Trump won the key New Hampshire primary Tuesday, moving him ever closer to locking in the Republican presidential nomination and securing an extraordinary White House rematch with Biden.) The move against Mayorkas, the first against a Cabinet officer in 150 years, is about the politics of symbolism. Republican know full well the Democrat-controlled Senate is not going to convict him. This was about keeping the spotlight on one of the GOP’s best issues . But if the press saddled Johnson with a humiliating defeat last week, it has to credit him with a big win now. Both episodes shed light on the fractious politics of the Hill. Just when it looked like the Senate might pass a bipartisan border security bill–which included military aid to Ukraine and Israel–Trump ripped it and the package was dead. YOU DON'T NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM TO SECURE THE BORDER: MARC THIESSEN Now the Senate appears ready to pass a stand-alone military aid bill by a filibuster-proof majority. But Johnson says he won’t bring it up for a House floor vote. That would bury it, unless a handful of Republican join with Democrat to force a vote through a discharge petition. Think about it: the United States, unable to help two major allies because of election-year politics, especially Ukraine, which remains under siege by Vladimir Putin. And that’s why Biden took the rare step of delivering a televised speech on Tuesday. His predecessor gave him an opening by saying he wouldn’t protect any NATO member who didn’t pay its fair share in military costs. And if that were the case, Putin and Russia could ""do whatever the hell they want."" WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 13: U.S. Biden speaks on the Senate's recent passage of the National Security Supplemental Bill, which provides military aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 13, 2024, in Washington, DC. During his remarks Biden urged House Republican and U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to move the legislation through the House of Representatives. Biden, in his speech , accused Trump of siding with the Russian dictator, calling the comments ""dumb,"" ""shameful,"" ""dangerous"" and ""un-American."" Put aside whether Biden is right or Trump is trying to pressure delinquent allies. Biden passed up a softball Super Bowl interview. So why is he getting in front of the cameras now? One, he’s trying to get push Congress to pass the military aid bill. Two, he’s trying to change the subject from his own questionable memory in that wake of that stinging special counsel’s report. Three, he is finally heeding the advice of those who say he needs to do more television to prove his competence and dim the focus on every gaffe or misstatement. What’s fascinating is the spin of each party when it comes to backing their candidate. Democrat are hitting the airwaves saying Biden is sharp and laser-focused in private, and counsel Robert Hur has no business airing his personal criticism of the president’s mental acuity. And everyone is getting sustained exposure to a system that generally favors political maneuvering over actual results.
