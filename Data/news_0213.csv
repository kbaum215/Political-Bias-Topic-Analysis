cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/tony-bobulinski-impeachment-investigation/index.html,"A former Biden family business associate levied critical but unproven allegations against President Joe Biden in a closed-door House interview Tuesday, resurrecting claims he has lobbed since 2020. Over the past several years, Tony Bobulinski has seemingly shared his story with anyone who would listen, including the Trump campaign. But his loftiest claims — that Joe Biden was deeply involved in his son’s overseas business deals — are still uncorroborated and have been undercut by other key witnesses. “Joe Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family’s business; he was an enabler, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability,” Bobulinski told House Oversight Committee investigators on Tuesday, according to a copy of his opening statement provided to CNN. He further said he believed the multi-million-dollar business deals secured by Joe Biden’s son and brother only materialized “because Joe Biden was in high office.” He said, “the Biden family business was Joe Biden, period,” and specifically mentioned Joe Biden’s alleged role in a lucrative proposed deal with a Chinese energy conglomerate. CNN has not independently verified the underlying evidence Bobulinski says supports his claims. Bobulinski went public in the final weeks of the 2020 race, only after unsuccessfully peddling his material to reporters, including at the conservative-leaning Wall Street Journal. When the newspaper covered Bobulinski’s public remarks, its story made clear that the China deal never closed, and that corporate records “show no role for Joe Biden.” In his opening statement Tuesday, Bobulinski said he “personally met” with Joe Biden in Los Angeles in May 2017 “multiple times to discuss the broad contours of our business dealings.” House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, praised Bobulinski’s testimony as well as criticized Democrats on the committee for how they participated in the interview. “We will soon release the transcript to provide the American people with transparency about Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s shady schemes and Democrats’ efforts to smear Mr. Bobulinski for blowing the whistle,” Comer said in a statement. While the interview was ongoing, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, slammed Bobulinski’s credibility, saying he was trying to spin two “encounters” with Joe Biden into substantive business meetings. “He had two encounters with President Biden in back-to-back days in May of 2017 that seemed extremely casual,” Raskin said. “They could not be described as meetings. And by his own account, they did not involve discussion of Joe Biden and business. So, this is then a witness who I think can be charitably described as out of control.” “He offers absolutely no testimony that indicates any criminal activity by President Biden. He offers no suggestion or evidence that President Biden was involved in Hunter Biden’s businesses,” Raskin added. Even after first going public in 2020, none of the federal stakeholders including the Justice Department, FBI or IRS have contacted him for his testimony, he said Tuesday. He approached the FBI in October 2020, and sat for an interview, but they never followed up, he said, and neither has the special counsel who is currently prosecuting Hunter Biden. Another business associate involved with Bobulinski and the president’s son recently poured cold water on Bobulinski’s claims in a separate interview with committee investigators. The witness, Rob Walker, told House Republicans in January he did not believe Bobulinski was a credible actor and would never consider working with him again. Walker framed Bobulinski’s allegations as “dumbfounded” and “nonsensical.” He speculated that Bobulinski’s motivations were “political.” “I think he had come to realize that Hunter had moved on without him and he was probably a little pissed also,” Walker added, “So that probably added a little fuel to Tony’s fire.” Walker recalled Bobulinski called him in October 2020 to discuss the possibility of Hunter Biden’s laptop and did not disclose at the time the conversation was being recorded or that it would be shared with Fox News. In the recording, Walker was quoted saying, “You’re just going to bury all of us, man.” In his January interview with lawmakers, Walker elaborated that he was not worried about criminal liability, but rather was concerned that Bobulinski’s antics would make everyone involved look bad. “I thought it was ridiculous that he was going to be – he was going to say something and that made no sense and was stupid and was just going to embarrass everybody,” Walker said. Bobulinski’s claims also stand in stark contrast to a growing list of other Biden family business associates who have stated that Joe Biden, as a private citizen and as vice president, was never involved in his any of his family’s foreign business dealings. Raskin had raised serious questions about Bobulinski’s credibility ahead of Tuesday’s interview. Republicans quickly pounced on Bobulinski’s claims as they seek to implicate the president in his family’s foreign business dealings as part of their impeachment inquiry, and many have praised him going into Tuesday’s interview. But Democrats called out Republicans for using Bobulinski’s allegations to paint the president as central to an elaborate criminal operation, while also questioning his ability to serve in light of special counsel Robert Hur’s final report , which painted a picture of a forgetful commander in chief. “Pick a side,” said Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas. “Either he is a criminal mastermind or he is old and feeble. Or it’s neither one of them.” Perhaps the most compelling piece of evidence ever offered by Bobulinski is an email from May 2017 that he exchanged with Hunter Biden and some of their fellow business partners. In the message, they discuss an equity arrangement for a forthcoming deal involving Chinese energy interests. One of the emails suggests there might be “10 held by H for the big guy,” referring to a 10% equity stake held by Hunter Biden for his father. House Republicans have seized on this email, arguing that it proves their thesis that Joe Biden was in business with his son, and that he made millions from China. But Hunter Biden’s lawyers have countered that the proposed equity breakdown from the email was “never included in any agreement” and that the breakdown was actually proposed by Bobulinski, and never even garnered any response from Hunter Biden. He was teed up for a highly anticipated interview with the GOP-run Senate Judiciary Committee, weeks before the 2020 election. But that was scrapped when he, instead, met with FBI investigators. Despite providing information to the FBI, federal prosecutors haven’t cited his materials in the sweeping tax indictment filed against Hunter Biden. The Justice Department has accused Hunter Biden of tax evasion and other financial crimes over many years. (He pleaded not guilty.) But prosecutors haven’t backed up the Republicans’ claims about the Biden family’s supposed influence-peddling schemes. This story has been updated with additional developments."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/alejandro-mayorkas-impeachment-vote/index.html,"The House of Representatives, by an extremely narrow margin, voted Tuesday to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in almost 150 years. The result came one week after the stunning loss House Republicans suffered when they last tried to impeach Mayorkas and GOP defections and an absence sank the initial floor vote, a move Republicans had hoped to use to spotlight the Biden administration’s handling of the southern border. The impeachment comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold President Joe Biden and his departments and agencies accountable over immigration and border security policies. House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar. FILE PHOTO: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas takes his seat to testify before a Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on the department's budget request on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 26, 2021. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo Kevin Lamarque/Reuters/File Related article How each US House member voted on impeaching Alejandro Mayorkas Only one Cabinet official has previously been impeached in American history: Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. Tuesday’s vote was 214 to 213. Three Republicans – Ken Buck of Colorado, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Tom McClintock of California – voted with Democrats against the measure. The Department of Homeland Security said that House Republicans “will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution” following the vote to impeach. “House Republicans will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution for political gain rather than working to solve the serious challenges at our border,” DHS spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said in a statement. “Secretary Mayorkas and the Department of Homeland Security will continue working every day to keep Americans safe,” the statement said. Last week, the absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the vote to approve the measure. Ken Buck, Tom McClintock, and Mike Gallagher are three House Republicans who voted against impeaching Mayorkas. AP, Getty, Reuters The embarrassing initial defeat of the Mayorkas impeachment effort – which was quickly followed by another floor failure over a standalone Israel aid package – only crystalized the GOP’s yearlong struggle to govern amid a rambunctious and anemic majority . In the fallout of the failed impeachment vote, Republican lawmakers openly aired their frustrations and pointed fingers as to who is to blame, with some questioning their own leadership’s decision-making. “I had many people reach out to me via text message and say, ‘What the hell are you guys doing up there?’ I think our base is a little frustrated,” GOP Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas told CNN. “We may have the gavel, but we’re not acting like we’re in the majority.” “I was embarrassed for our conference, for our party, because we can do better than we did last night,” said GOP Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas. The meltdown – just the latest in a long string of chaotic moments under this GOP majority – is raising fresh concerns over how Republicans will navigate the fast approaching government funding deadline and their ability to maintain control of the House after November. “It was a lousy day. Two bad play calls back to back. Both active choices to schedule them. It was a huge mistake,” said GOP Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, an ally to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. “The speaker is a very nice man,” he said of Speaker Mike Johnson, but added, “He’s gotta learn from his mistakes.” White House spokesman Ian Sams called the failed impeachment vote a “baseless, unconstitutional impeachment stunt” and said there is “bipartisan agreement” that it should fail. When presented with a bipartisan legislative solution negotiated with Senate Republicans however, GOP House members flatly rejected it , which contributed to the ultimate squashing of the deal. Even with Mayorkas impeached in the House, it is highly unlikely that he will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office said in a statement, “The House impeachment managers will present the articles of impeachment to the Senate following the state work period. Senators will be sworn in as jurors in the trial the next day. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray will preside.” “This sham impeachment effort is another embarrassment for House Republicans,” Schumer said in a statement. “The one and only reason for this impeachment is for Speaker Johnson to further appease Donald Trump.” While Republicans have been investigating Mayorkas’ handling of the border since they reclaimed the House majority, momentum to plot a swift impeachment of the secretary picked up steam last month as key swing-district Republicans expressed fresh openness to the idea amid a recent surge of migrant crossings at the southern border . Mayorkas has sent a letter to House Republicans to defend his record in public service in advance of the vote. “My reverence for law enforcement was instilled in me by my parents, who brought me to this country to escape the Communist takeover of Cuba and allow me the freedoms and opportunity that our democracy provides,” Mayorkas said. Mayorkas wrote that “the problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new” and called on Congress to help provide a legislative solution to the “historically divisive issue.” He praised the bipartisan group of senators he has worked with for its willingness to put their differences aside to try to find solutions at the border. Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee have repeatedly bashed their Republican colleagues for their efforts to impeach Mayorkas and have released a report calling the GOP effort “a sham.” Instead of formally launching an impeachment inquiry with a House floor vote, the GOP effort to impeach Mayorkas has been unilaterally run through the Homeland Security Committee as opposed to the House Judiciary Committee, where impeachment articles typically originate, though it is not constitutionally required. In the investigative phase, Homeland Security Committee Republicans held 10 hearings, published five interim reports and conducted 11 transcribed interviews with current and former Border Patrol agents. But since launching the inquiry, the GOP-led panel has held only two hearings and has decided to move forward with impeachment articles without giving the secretary an opportunity to testify. Republicans invited Mayorkas to testify at an impeachment hearing on January 18. But the DHS secretary said he was hosting Mexican Cabinet members to discuss border enforcement, and he asked to work with the committee on scheduling a different date, according to a letter obtained by CNN.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/steve-scalise-interview/index.html,"House Majority Leader Steve Scalise defended Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to hold last week’s failed vote on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, telling CNN in an interview the vote was a “tough judgement call” and that it may have helped lock in GOP lawmakers on the fence. “They felt it was important, there were some members that you know, might have been going back and forth, and to lock them in,” Scalise said ahead of a second vote to impeach Mayorkas scheduled for Tuesday evening . “I know these are all tough judgment calls, but to make sure that you lock everybody into who’s a ‘yes,’ and now we know we’re one vote short, and let’s go get that done,” Scalise added. Scalise missed last week’s impeachment vote – which failed in an embarrassing defeat, 214-216, with three House Republicans voting against it – but he’s back in Washington on Tuesday and in “complete remission” following successful stem cell treatment for a form of blood cancer. So long as there are no more unforeseen absences, Scalise’s return will make him the decisive vote allowing Republicans to impeach Mayorkas. The vote is occurring the same night that New York is holding a special election to replace expelled former Republican Rep. George Santos, giving Democrats the opportunity to make the GOP’s razor-thin majority in the House even tighter. While Republicans won the district in 2022 with Santos, Scalise sought to downplay expectations, noting that Republican candidate Mazi Pilip is going up against former Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi in a congressional district that President Joe Biden carried in 2020. “The whole Democratic apparatus of the state of New York is supporting Suozzi in a Democrat-leaning seat,” Scalise said. “So, if we’re able to pull this off, it would be a real kind of shock-the-world moment and show that the Republicans can win in tough places.” If Democrats win Tuesday night, Scalise would not say whether Republicans would regret that Santos, who is facing federal charges, was kicked out of Congress. “At the end of the day, that happened, the House did its will, you can’t undo that. So, the real question is, can we still hold the seat?” Scalise asked. “Santos was a surprise when he flipped that seat. So you know, we’re going to be working hard to hold it. And the Democrats are surely pulling out every stop to try to get it as well.” Scalise backed Johnson’s vow not to take up the Senate’s $95.3 billion foreign aid bill that passed 70-29 early Tuesday morning . While GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell called on Johnson to hold a vote on the measure, which includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, the House speaker has said that the package must also include border security – even though House Republicans swiftly rejected a border compromise struck by the Senate earlier this month. Scalise said that the Senate deal did not have any key policies from the Republican immigration bill that passed the House last year. “That bill is still sitting over in the Senate, but those policies have to be part of any kind of deal,” Scalise said. “We’ve been clear from the beginning that you’ve got to actually focus on securing America’s border, especially when you’re talking about Ukraine.” Scalise said that Johnson had requested a meeting with Biden on the border, but that the president had rejected it. “If the President really does want Ukraine funding, shouldn’t he be sitting down with the speaker now?” Scalise said. Scalise said that an immigration bill was “not just about getting, you know, a few people in a room together and saying let’s pass a bill that we can all agree on” – a reference to the Senate’s negotiations, which included Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma. Asked what message it would send to allies around the world not to pass an aid package to Ukraine, Scalise argued that the US has already provided billions. “We already passed billions of dollars in funding for Ukraine, so we clearly support their efforts to push back on the Russians’ aggression,” Scalise said. “The question is right now, can we also get an agreement on securing America’s border? And shouldn’t that be the front-and-center debate right now? Shouldn’t the president be engaged in that debate with the House Republican majority?” Scalise defended former President Donald Trump’s comments on NATO over the weekend – when the former president said that he once told a NATO country’s leader he’d encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” if the country didn’t pay their fair share in defense – saying that when he ran in 2016, Trump successfully prodded European countries to spend more on defense. NATO members are supposed to commit 2% of their GDP to defense spending, though many countries in the alliance do not meet that goal. “President Trump was good in pointing out that if this is about America helping protect Europe, shouldn’t Europe be paying their fair share more than anybody?” Scalise asked. “So you’ve even seen countries like Poland that are approaching 2% because they recognize now how important this relationship is, and that you can’t just count on the US to fund the whole thing when the agreement was every country pays their fair share,” Scalise said. “That, I think, is what President Trump continues to talk about. President Biden hadn’t pushed those countries to pay their fair share.” Scalise declined to weigh in on a symbolic resolution from Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz and other Trump allies declaring that Trump never incited an insurrection or rebellion on January 6. Scalise said that he hadn’t read the resolution – another example of Trump’s allies seeking to rewrite the narrative about January 6 – and that it would go through the committee process. The House majority leader was critical of the legal cases against Trump blending into the presidential election, saying there shouldn’t be efforts to kick Trump off the ballot or trials right before Election Day. Asked about the GOP impeachment inquiry into Biden, Scalise said that process was continuing. “We have a process that’s playing out with President Biden, it’s an impeachment inquiry that we’re in the middle of right now,” Scalise said, noting Republicans continued to collect testimony this week. Scalise said that the stem cell treatment he received for his blood cancer forced him to isolate for six weeks while his immune system recovered, but he’s happy to be back in Washington. “I feel great,” Scalise said. “Being out for six weeks was tough, but it’s really good to be back.” This story has been updated with additional developments."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/trump-hush-money-hearing-will-attend/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump is expected to attend Thursday’s hearing in the New York hush money criminal case, according to Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead attorney for the Georgia election subversion case. Trump had considered traveling to Georgia on Thursday for a hearing in the criminal case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis but is now planning to attend the hearing in New York, multiple sources familiar with the matter said. His expected court appearance comes just before the former president could face another consequential legal decision – this time on the fate of his business empire in New York. Both hearings are scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. ET. Fulton County DA Fani Willis appears for a hearing on November 21, 2023. Dennis Byron/Pool/Getty Images Related article Fulton County DA could be disqualified from Trump case if she financially benefitted from relationship with top prosecutor Initially, Trump was intrigued by the idea of traveling to Georgia if Willis was forced to take the stand and answer questions under oath about allegations she engaged in an improper romantic relationship with her top deputy, Nathan Wade, one of the sources told CNN. A judge on Monday did not rule out the possibility that Willis will have to testify but made clear that is contingent on what other witnesses say first. Trump’s advisers made the case that the New York hearing is more important as it is a criminal case that directly impacts him, according to a source familiar with internal discussions. Trump was charged last March with falsifying business records to commit or conceal another crime. Prosecutors allege that the former president engaged in a cover up scheme to hide reimbursement payments made to his former attorney, Michael Cohen who had paid hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public about a past affair with Trump before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges and denied the affair. The hearing in Fulton County is largely viewed by those advisers as procedural despite the possibility of Willis taking the stand and facing disqualification. As always, senior advisers warned that Trump could still change his mind last minute and decide to attend the hearing in Georgia, however that is not currently the plan. Trump civil fraud trial decision expected Friday Trump, barring unforeseen circumstances, will also learn on Friday how much the judge overseeing the civil fraud case in New York is ordering him and his real estate business to pay for fraudulently inflating financial statements for a decade, a person familiar with knowledge of the decision said. Judge Arthur Engoron initially said he hoped to issue the ruling at the end of January, following a three-month trial. Since then, the monitor overseeing the Trump Organization issued a report, and the judge inquired about news articles of a possible perjury plea deal by former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. It appears any delays caused by those two events have now been resolved. The New York attorney general’s office sued Trump alleging he engaged in a decadelong fraud by inflating the value of properties to obtain better rates on loans and insurance. They also allege Trump and others violated numerous other New York laws related to the issuance of false financial statements. The state is seeking more than $370 million and to ban Trump from doing business in New York state . They are also seeking to ban his two adult sons from running a business in the state for five years. Trump and his adult sons have denied any wrongdoing and said no one was harmed by the alleged fraud. This story has been updated with additional information.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/lloyd-austin-hospital/index.html,"CNN — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was released from the hospital Tuesday afternoon after being treated for a bladder issue and is expected to return to the Pentagon “later this week,” the Defense Department said. He resumed his full duties from home at 5 p.m., approximately 48 hours after he had first transferred his responsibilities to his deputy, Kathleen Hicks. Austin will “recuperate and perform his duties remotely from home for a period before returning to work at the Pentagon later this week,” the Pentagon said in a statement. Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said earlier Tuesday that Austin was “in good condition” and that the Pentagon anticipated he would be released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center later in the day. The bladder issue that hospitalized Austin on Sunday was not related to the prostate cancer diagnosis he received in Decembe﻿r, Singh said. Doctors at Walter Reed said it was related to the surgery to treat the cancer. Complications from the procedure first sent Austin to the hospital on New Year’s Day, where he stayed for two weeks. The cause of the recent bladder issue was identified and was treated with a non-surgical procedure on Monday, doctors said. The secretary, Singh said, still anticipates participating in and providing opening remarks at the virtual Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday. Austin’s recent hospitalization came just weeks after he was admitted in January following complications from a procedure to treat his prostate cancer. He was intensely criticized for a dayslong delay in notifying the White House of that hospitalization, for which he has said he takes full responsibility. “I want to be crystal clear: We did not handle this right. And I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility,” Austin said at a news conference this month. “I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.” An administration official told CNN on Tuesday that President Joe Biden and Austin spoke by phone on Tuesday, and the president wished “him well in his recovery.” A statement from Austin’s doctors on Monday said Austin underwent “non-surgical procedures under general anesthesia to address his bladder issue.” They added that they believed he would make a “successful recovery.” They have also said Austin is “expected to make a full recovery” from his cancer diagnosis.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/new-york-special-election-what-to-watch/index.html,"CNN — The special election to replace former Rep. George Santos in New York’s 3rd Congressional District, an emerging battleground that could serve as a bellwether for other suburbs this fall, appears to be headed for a neck-and-neck finish after two months of campaigning bolstered by millions in outside spending. The district, which encompasses Nassau County on Long Island and northeast Queens, is largely well-educated and affluent – the kind of place Democrats now expect to win – but because of its ideological diversity, a recent trend toward the GOP and a deeply rooted county Republican Party machine, it has become a true Election Day wild card. Rep. Tom Suozzi, Democratic candidate for New York's 3rd Congressional District, and Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., left, conduct the ""Women For Suozzi Rally,"" in Port Washington, New York, on Saturday, February 3. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/AP Related article New York Democrats are worried about Tuesday’s special election. They have good reason to be Tuesday’s outcome could provide lessons for both parties as the general election season nears and both the presidential contest and the race for control of the House are expected to turn, in large part, on the views of suburban voters. In the near term, victory for Democrat Tom Suozzi, who previously represented the district in Congress after running Nassau County for most of the 2000s, would provide a lift for President Joe Biden – who won the district by 8 points in 2020 – and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, who will likely need the seat if he’s to become speaker next year. Victory for Republican Mazi Pilip, a largely unknown county legislator from Great Neck, would signal the potential for more GOP gains across the country – and provide some comfort to a slate of freshmen GOP House members from New York who will be defending their seats in November. Suozzi’s election as Nassau County executive in 2001 broke Republicans’ 30-year lock on the position. After losing his bid for a third term in 2009, then falling in Democratic primaries for statewide office, Suozzi was elected to the US House in 2016. He was reelected two more times before leaving the seat for another unsuccessful campaign for governor. But his brand remains strong on Long Island, which led the party to handpick him as the nominee after the special election was called. Pilip is lesser known in the district but has the powerful county party – which also controls most local offices in Nassau – driving her campaign, which, if successful, would provide the clearest proof yet that Republicans are once again the political kings of Long Island. She would also be the first Black Republican to represent New York in Congress. Here’s what to watch for: The three I’s and abortion Immigration, inflation, Israel and the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade framed the political landscape on Long Island while Santos served his final days in office last year. A couple of months on, they remain – along with the cost of housing – the big issues facing the candidates. Immigration, though, has become – if not the most important – then the most talked about issue in the campaign. Pilip has repeatedly hammered Suozzi over a past clash with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and sought to direct anger over the migrant crisis in nearby New York City his way. In their only debate last week, Pilip said Suozzi “voted to open the borders” and, along with Biden, “created the migrant crisis” during his time in Congress. Though that might seem like a bit of a stretch given Suozzi’s position, frustration with border policy is a potent political tool – especially on Long Island, where voters largely get their news from city outlets and view the city’s problems as previews of their own. Inflation remains an important topic, but less so than perhaps a year or so ago when prices were soaring. Israel has been a point of discussion, if not debate. Suozzi is a staunch supporter, as is Pilip, who emigrated there and served in the Israel Defense Forces before coming to the US. Abortion, though, could yet again emerge as an X-factor. Suozzi supports abortion rights and wants to codify Roe v. Wade. Pilip is more difficult to pin down. She calls herself “pro-life” but has said, “When it comes to abortion, every woman should have the choice to make that decision” and that she would not vote for a federal ban. During the debate, Suozzi pressed her repeatedly to stake out a clearer position. After a long back-and-forth, though, the question remained unsettled. The Suozzi brand vs. the GOP machine Suozzi has deep roots in the district. He is a moderate – campaigning, governing and legislating as one. If there had been a primary for the nomination, he probably would have attracted a more liberal challenger. So Pilip’s and GOP allies’ attacks suggesting he’s a “ Squad ” wannabe didn’t land with too many voters here. But there is another brand to consider: the Democrats. The party has lost races at almost every level on Long Island beginning in 2021, and Republicans are following a similar playbook this year, hammering Suozzi (and Biden) over New York City’s migrant crisis , along with rising cost-of-living and housing concerns. Neither candidate is advertising their party affiliation on the thousands of lawn signs across the county, and both have steered clear of national party leaders, at least publicly. However, the singular question entering Election Day is whether Suozzi’s generally positive reputation is enough to overcome a powerful GOP machine that is primed to drive – perhaps literally, in some cases – its supporters to the polls. The weather! Early voting numbers showed registered Democrats turning out at a higher clip, but operatives in both parties aren’t investing much in the information. Democrats tend to vote early; Republicans usually prefer casting their ballots on Election Day. The twist Tuesday is that the New York City metropolitan area saw a surge of snow early morning from a strong and fast-moving nor’easter . Long Island is relatively condensed – in comparison with a place like Iowa, at least – but the snow and sleet could potentially disadvantage Republicans. Congressional Leadership Fund, a leading House GOP super PAC, hired multiple snow plows to help with get-out-the-vote efforts Tuesday, the group said. Speaking outside a polling place in Massapequa on Tuesday, Pilip said her campaign and allies would provide rides for people who want to get to the polls. “This is a day we have been working very hard for the last eight weeks,” she said. Suozzi also said his campaign was also offering rides to the polls, with about 30 people out as drivers. “The weather’s falling on the Democrats and Republicans. Nice and bipartisan – just the way I like things,” he said while campaigning in Uniondale. Remember George Santos? The shunned charlatan has been mostly out of sight and mind since being expelled from Congress last year over assorted personal lies, misconduct and alleged crimes. And for all the hoopla surrounding his brief stint as the district’s nominal “representative,” the specter of Santos is not expected to play a big role in the outcome. That’s in part because Suozzi has mostly ignored the sage, figuring that’s not what will influence the swing voters he needs to win back his old seat. Democratic operatives also believe that any Santos bounce was baked into the campaign a long time ago – with previously unengaged Democratic voters angry over his deceptions and primed now to vote and, in many cases, volunteer for Suozzi. Pilip has obviously not spent too much time talking about Santos, but Republicans are banking on an idea that, as the county becomes increasingly Trump-pilled, conservatives might turn out if for no other reason than to stick it to the Democrats, who, in this telling, drove the duly elected Republican out of office. Note: Almost all local GOP officials and officeholders called for Santos to resign, and the vote to expel him from Congress was a rare bipartisan success.

The Democratic National Committee has taken multiple steps in recent days to portray Kennedy as a spoiler who would help Republican frontrunner Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden , arguing Kennedy is funded primarily by wealthy donors aligned with the former president. Last week, the DNC filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Kennedy’s campaign had illegally coordinated with American Values 2024, a PAC backing his White House bid. Kennedy’s campaign has denied coordinating with the group. In a call with reporters outlining the complaint, DNC adviser Ramsey Reid blamed Trump and his donors for turning Kennedy into a “stalking horse” by funding the PAC. “We’re concerned that Donald Trump is disrespecting the democratic process. It’s pretty clear that Trump and his megadonors are propping up RFK Jr. as a stalking horse,” Reid said. Robert F.

Eva Marie Uzcategui/Getty Images Related article RFK Jr. apologizes to cousins offended by Super Bowl ad’s reference to JFK The DNC has homed in on donations to the PAC from billionaire Tim Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking fortune who has been a prolific donor to pro-Trump and other GOP causes over the years. Mellon gave approximately $15 million to American Values 2024 last year. In 2020, he gave $20 million to America First Action Inc., one of the leading outside groups backing Trump’s reelection. On Saturday, as Kennedy held a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the DNC advertised on four billboards around the area accusing Kennedy of being “powered by MAGA/Trump.” And after the Kennedy-aligned PAC released a new TV ad during the Super Bowl that repurposed an old spot from the 1960 campaign of President John F. Kennedy, the candidate’s uncle, the DNC issued a statement highlighting the PAC’s funding from Mellon. “It’s fitting that the first national ad promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s candidacy was bought and paid for by Donald Trump’s largest donor this cycle,” DNC rapid response director Alex Floyd said in a statement released shortly after the ad aired Sunday. Kennedy’s team pushed back on the Democratic attacks, saying that donors “from across the political spectrum are supporting the Kennedy campaign as they are tired of the corruption in the two-party system.” “Instead, donors want an independent candidate who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, end the forever wars, unravel corporate capture, and the end chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN. DNC adviser Lis Smith told CNN the party’s latest efforts are meant to educate voters on the connections between Trump and Kennedy, while acknowledging the critical role Kennedy could play in the general election. “It’s clear that Donald Trump and his allies view him as a useful stalking horse who could help throw the election to Trump in November,” Smith said. While his independent campaign faces steep odds of success, Kennedy’s candidacy could influence the outcome of a Biden-Trump rematch if he garners enough support in critical states. In the 2020 election, Biden flipped three states – Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin – by margins of less than 1%. Recent national polling of a Trump-Biden rematch suggests the race could be narrowly decided again. A CNN/SSRS poll released earlier this month showed Trump with 49% support among registered voters, compared with 45% for Biden. It’s unclear as of now how Kennedy would affect a potential general election between Biden and Trump – whether he’d draw more support from historically Republican or Democratic voters, or whether he’d receive enough total support to influence the election either way. An NBC News poll released this month found 34% of registered voters saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy. But Kennedy’s allies have targeted Biden and Democrats as they look to gain traction in the race, a sign they’re ready to meet the DNC’s escalating attacks straight ahead. In a statement released after the Super Bowl ad, American Values 2024 co-founder Mark Gorton criticized the DNC for its efforts targeting Kennedy. “The only argument the DNC has left is that Biden is not Trump. When RFK Jr. gets on the ballot, the American public will have the ability to choose a candidate who is not Trump, who has integrity, bravery, a proven track record of fighting corporate corruption, and the ability to stand up to the corporate interests that have taken over the Biden administration. The American people are waking up, and the DNC’s only hope is to prevent them from having a choice,” Gorton said. This story has been updated with additional information.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/congress-trump-nato-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — Lawmakers from both parties last December may have been anticipating former President Donald Trump’s current NATO trash talk when they quietly slipped language limiting a president’s power to pull the US out the alliance into the annual defense policy bill , which passed with bipartisan support. Trump boasted at a weekend campaign rally that as president he told an unidentified NATO leader that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” with member countries who are in arrears on defense spending. The whole point of NATO is supposed to be that members act to defend each other if attacked. President Joe Biden seized on Trump’s recent NATO bashing, suggesting in Tuesday remarks from the White House that Trump was the first president who “bowed down” to a Russian dictator, which Biden said was “dumb,” “shameful,” “dangerous” and “un-American.” Add that criticism to a chorus of alarm from NATO and European officials after Trump’s comments and in the midst of House Republicans’ blockage of additional aid for Ukraine. Trump’s desire to pull out of NATO The post-World War II alliance of Western democracies was built around NATO, but Trump has long complained that the US is getting a raw deal with the organization, paying too much and getting too little. Trump’s ultimate goal, writes CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen , has long been to pull the US out of NATO, which was formed in 1949 to contain the threat of the Soviet Union and the spread of communism and is now organized around deterring Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN’s Jim Sciutto, in a forthcoming book , quotes a former official in both the Trump and Biden administrations who predicts a Trump election win in November would mean “the US will be out of NATO.” Sciutto also writes about how Trump nearly pulled the US from the alliance during a 2018 NATO meeting. At the same time, Trump tried to claim credit, arguing it is his tough talk and not the threat of Russian invasion that has caused NATO member countries to increase their defense budgets in recent years. What’s to stop him? If Trump wins the 2024 election and does turn on NATO, he would run into that new language from Congress, which says the president “shall not suspend, terminate, denounce, or withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty” without either a supermajority vote in the Senate or an act passed by the full Congress. When I asked the former US Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker about what Trump could do to undermine NATO as president, he first pointed out that Trump was boasting about his interaction with an unnamed world leader rather than promising future action. Kurt Volker testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on November 19, 2019, in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The Constitution, Volker noted, says the Senate must be involved with ratifying treaties but it is silent on the subject of withdrawing from a treaty. Any court battle could take years. Alternatives to withdrawal Rather than attempting to withdraw from NATO, a second Trump presidency could allow his allies to pursue a policy of making NATO “ dormant ,” an idea pushed by at least one Trump-allied think tank. Nobody knows exactly what that would look like, Volker said, but the president has immense power over how the US interacts with its allies. “There’s lots of things that you can do administratively as the commander in chief that would still be very disruptive for NATO,” Volker said. A president could reduce the number of exercises Americans take part in with NATO allies, further reduce troop presence in Europe, withhold payments to the NATO infrastructure or cut down on the US military budget. The US would still be bound, under this type of scenario, by the pledge to defend other NATO nations, but it would not be prepared. “It’s not just enough to say, yes, we will fight together,” said Volker. “You actually have to have the capabilities.” Americans lead NATO by design If Trump wins the election this year and then seeks as president to reduce American military participation, he could, in theory, recall the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower first held the job after NATO’s founding, and ever since, the top NATO commander has always been an American admiral or general. NATO’s power to deter attacks on other countries rests in large part on American nuclear weapons, and so it is appropriate that an American service member sits atop the NATO structure, according to Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. This December 1957 photo shows heads of government, including US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, attending the annual ""family portrait"" during NATO top-level meetings at the Palais de Chaillot. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Pulling American generals out of NATO might force other NATO countries to seek their own nuclear deterrents. Part of the reason Europeans have not pursued a collective European military is by American design and a result of security provided by NATO, Bergmann said. Countries are eager to be protected by Article 5 of NATO’s charter, which is the principle that an attack on one member is an attack on all of the members. Sweden and Finland have both worked hard to join after Russia invaded non-member Ukraine. Finland joined in 2023, and Sweden is inching closer to accession . That provision that Trump dislikes has only been invoked one time, after 9/11, when the US and NATO allies invaded Afghanistan after terror attacks brought down the World Trade Center and struck the Pentagon. More members hit 2% benchmark Trump frequently complains that NATO members other than the US don’t pay dues, which is a misstatement of facts . Members are supposed to spend a minimum of 2% of their GDP on defense, but it is just a guideline that doesn’t require payments to NATO or the US. Multiple NATO countries do not hit that benchmark, although spending has risen since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “That argument is weaker and weaker, because allies are indeed spending more and doing more,” Volker said. NATO’s charter is a relatively short and simple document. Its section on how a country withdraws from the alliance is further evidence of how central the US is to the organization: A country wishing to withdraw must notify the US a year before it plans to withdraw. No country, by the way, has ever withdrawn from NATO, although France did not take part in NATO’s military operations from the mid-1960s until 2009. A difficult relationship to unbreak If Trump is reelected and chooses to hollow out NATO or make US participation dormant, it would sever ties that future presidents might have trouble repairing. “It’s just like any relationship,” said Bergmann of the likelihood of permanent damage if Trump were to materially alter the NATO alliance. “This would be seen as the US basically having a massive affair and like cheating on Europe. Could the marriage be restored? Well, potentially. But it would require, I think, a lot of effort on the part of future administrations.” Marco Rubio is not worried Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was a sponsor of the new law meant to prohibit a president from leaving NATO. Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, he dismissed the threat posed by Trump. “He’s telling a story,” Rubio said, adding, “He doesn’t talk like a traditional politician, and we’ve already been through this. You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.” “I have zero concern, because he’s been president before. I know exactly what he has done and will do with the NATO alliance,” Rubio said, although he added, “But there has to be an alliance.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/new-york-special-election-biden-trump/index.html,"CNN — Democrats, when confronted with President Joe Biden ’s poor polling numbers, often counter with some form of the following: “Polls are polls, but when people vote, Democrats are doing well.” The idea being that Democrats have done well in major special and off-year elections since the 2022 midterms. The special election in New York’s 3rd Congressional District to succeed the infamous George Santos offers perhaps the best chance to test Democrats’ theory ahead of the presidential election. Does former Rep. Tom Suozzi win in yet another example of Democrats defying national polling trends? Or does Nassau County Legislator Mazi Pilip secure victory, showing how Republicans are winning pivotal races in places Biden comfortably won in 2020? Yes, we’re looking at just one election on Long Island, but it’s a fascinating one. As we enter Election Day, the race seems far too close to call. A Newsday/Siena College poll released last week put Suozzi at 48% and Pilip at 44%, a result well within the margin of error. Throw in forecasted bad weather in this Nassau County and eastern Queens district, and we really can’t be certain who will emerge victorious. The fact that the race is tight makes sense if you look at the district’s recent voting record . I mentioned that Biden carried the seat in 2020 (by 8 points), but local Republicans have been dominating since. They did well in 2023’s local races . GOP candidates for governor and US Senate won the district by margins between 4 and 12 points in 2022, as did Santos. This means that even a narrow Suozzi victory would be impressive for Democrats given how well Republicans have done in other elections in the area. Indeed, outside of Long Island, Democrats did well in last year’s big elections. They won the Kentucky gubernatorial election , maintained their majority in the Virginia Senate and flipped the Virginia House . The candidate favored by Democrats won a Wisconsin Supreme Court race , which gave the more liberal justices a majority on that court. A lot of analysts (myself included) have been skeptical about making too much of these results. Turnout in off-year elections is often low. Voters who have been showing up for these off-year races have been more Democratic-leaning than their share of all registered voters in the same states and districts     . Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at the Hyatt Hotel in Coralville, Iowa, on December 13. Scott Olson/Getty Images Related article Why Donald Trump should be hoping for high voter turnout Of course, we’re now in a presidential election year, and there are also signs that these off-year results may have been pointing at something important. Yes, the turnout may have been more Democratic than among all registered voters. But the turnout in the presidential election may be as well. Most national pollsters are gauging responses from registered voters. Not all registered voters will cast a ballot in the presidential election. When pollsters such as Ipsos and The New York Times have honed on either those certain to vote or those likely to vote this year, Biden has done significantly better against his likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump . Ipsos, for example, recently showed a 5-point lead for the former president among registered voters becoming a tie among those certain to vote. A Suozzi win would further prove the point that Democrats do well when voters are treated to an actual campaign. On the other hand, a win by Pilip would give us a different narrative. This is the only federal election since the midterms that has been remotely competitive. All the other competitive races were state elections, and voting patterns between US House and presidential elections are far more correlated than they are for state offices and presidential elections. While it would be easy to dismiss a Pilip win by saying that Long Island has swung to the right since 2020, the rest of the country may have as well. Remember that in the last high-turnout election (the 2022 midterms), Republicans won control of the US House . They did so while winning the House popular vote by 3 points. That Republican victory represented a 6-point swing from the 2020 House elections . Moreover, that 3-point Republican edge in 2022 looks a lot like Trump’s current advantage over Biden among registered voters nationally. In other words, it’s possible that the national environment hasn’t moved all that much from the last time Republicans secured an important win. So a victory by Pilip would suggest that perhaps things aren’t all that different from where we were in 2022. This would mean that we have a closely divided electorate, but one with which Republicans are favored. Either way, you can bet your last dollar that both sides will try to spin the New York special election result. What else would you expect when there’s been more than $10 million spent on ads , which I can report have been playing nonstop on local television."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/trump-appeal-scotus-delay-tactic-analysis/index.html,"Donald Trump’s filing to the Supreme Court over his claim for sweeping presidential immunity begins with a quote from Yogi Berra. “This application is déjà vu all over again,” the former president’s lawyers write, noting that special counsel Jack Smith had tried and failed to get the nine justices to decide the question on a fast-track basis in December. But another of the late and revered New York Yankees catcher’s phrases offers a better summation of Trump’s interminable delay-at-all-costs legal strategy designed to defer a reckoning until after November’s election — “It ain’t over till it’s over.” The ex-president asked the Supreme Court on Monday to step in to temporarily block a US Court of Appeals decision that last week eviscerated his claims that a president is effectively above the law while in office and shielded from prosecution afterwards. The filing is Trumpian in its audacity. In essence, it argues that it would be unfair to millions of voters if the ex-President cannot get his message out in the 2024 election because he is on trial over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The former president was less concerned about the rights of voters when he sought to thwart their choice to eject him from office in 2020. After an unprecedented effort by Trump to interrupt the cherished tradition of peaceful transfers of power three years ago, Trump’s attorneys nevertheless insist the real “stunning breach of precedent and historical norms” is that the lower court ruled that presidential immunity for official acts does not exist at all. While Trump argues he was using presidential power in a legitimate effort to bring to light electoral fraud, there is nothing in the Constitution that gives the president the right or duty to officially administer elections, count votes or contact local election officials as the ex-president is alleged to have done. The coming days could decide when the first Trump trial takes place The text of Trump’s filing to the court at times feels somewhat frivolous. In tone and depth, it contrasts to the tightly argued repudiation of his claims for immunity last week by three appeals court judges that was widely praised by legal scholars. And it reflected the extraordinarily broad and improbable vision of almost unconstrained presidential power to which Trump warmed in office and that he appears to relish regaining if he wins November’s election ahead of a term he has vowed would be devoted to retribution against his enemies. “This brief, this petition for a stay, is pretty weak,” Ty Cobb, a former counsel in Trump’s White House, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “I don’t think the Supreme Court is going to find these arguments compelling in any way.” Trump’s latest request comes at a critical moment because the steps that the Supreme Court takes in coming days will likely decide whether this case — one of the most potentially damaging of the four criminal trials that await Trump — will go to a jury before the election. This is not just a matter of seeking accountability for the ex-president’s bid to stay in power despite losing the last election to President Joe Biden. It could also sway the destiny of the White House since some polls, including a national NBC News survey this month , suggest that some Trump voters may not support him if he’s a convicted felon when they go to vote. In what is expected to be a close election, even small-scale defections from Biden could weigh on the result. Trump’s legal team has a good reason to try to run out the clock. Therefore its moves should be assessed as much for their political impact as for the quality of litigation in an election season that has merged Trump’s legal and campaign strategies. Trump asked the Supreme Court to put the entire case on hold to allow him to pursue the full extent of his rights as an appellant, potentially to include a so-called en banc appeal to a full bench of appeals court judges and then ultimately to the high court, a process that could take many weeks or months. But it is not certain that the Supreme Court, which last week heard oral arguments on another Trump case — over his expulsion from Colorado’s ballot — will even agree to take his latest request. The special counsel has until February 20 to respond to Trump’s petition, though Smith is likely to file much earlier. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the real world impact of the new petition was that it would “almost certainly dictate whether or not Donald Trump goes on trial on Jack Smith’s election case before or after the 2024 election.” First, the Supreme Court must decide whether to grant a stay, but Honig said, “The bigger question is: Will the Supreme Court ultimately take this case? If they do not take the case it’s going to go back down to the district court, and I think we are very likely looking at a trial this summer. If they do take the case and set it on something close to a normal schedule, I think in all likelihood that would push the timeline here out until after the 2024 election — that’s how big the stakes are.” Norm Eisen, another CNN legal analyst, said that the court would likely grant some kind of stay, but that even if it did decide to take the case, the court could put it on an expedited schedule. “The long-term odds for success are poor. But it’s a delay game at this point,” Eisen said. But Trump and Smith both know time is short with a trial threatening to coincide with the heat of the presidential election. “The really precarious situation that Jack Smith finds themselves in and the Justice Department find themselves in is that every day matters at this point, given the calendar and the political calendar,” Ankush Khardori, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I don’t expect them to countenance the whole delaying tactic, at least I hope that they will not, but we are now starting to cut it pretty close here.” Trump’s extraordinary collision of legal peril As is often the case, Trump had a crowded legal docket on Monday. The historic spectacle of a former president making an unprecedented request for blanket immunity — that appears to fly in the face of founding US principles of constraining unaccountable executive power — only emerged after an earlier court appearance. The former president took part in a closed hearing in Florida as his lawyers haggled with Smith’s team for access to classified material pertinent to the case over his hoarding of secret government documents at his resort home. As with Smith’s Washington case, Trump’s team is seeking to delay the trial currently scheduled for May. The former president is also expected in court on Thursday in Manhattan, in a hearing related to a hush money payment sent to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. That case is now expected to be the first of Trump’s four criminal trials to go ahead at the end of March — after the judge in the federal elections case postponed the start of her proceeding pending the ex-president’s appeals. Trump is hoping meanwhile that Fani Willis, the district attorney leading his Georgia election subversion case, could be dismissed following the disclosure of a personal relationship with a lead prosecutor. A hearing is set for Thursday after a judge presiding over the case said Willis could be disqualified if she financially benefited from the relationship. And in yet another fateful development in court his week for Trump, a New York judge is expected to issue his ruling on Friday over how much Trump will have to pay over ill-gotten gains related to a civil fraud trial targeting the former President, the Trump Organization and his adult sons. A large chunk of Trump’s fortune is at risk in the case as well as his capacity to do business in New York state. This stunning roster of cases is an oppressive load for any defendant — let alone one running for president – but it does not even complete the full extent of his legal liabilities. However, it raises the prospect of a dark period ahead for Trump if he doesn’t win the 2024 election and is not able to use presidential power to halt trials or reverse convictions in any of the federal proceedings against him. This story has been updated with additional developments."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — While the 2024 presidential race seems set in stone as a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, it’s also true that things happen. Back in November 1872, for instance, the newspaper publisher and Democratic presidential candidate Horace Greeley died after Election Day but before the casting of Electoral College votes. While it did not affect the outcome – President Ulysses S. Grant easily won reelection – Greeley’s death created the difficult question of what to do with the 66 Electoral College votes he had won. Most electors, meeting in state capitols, did not cast votes for the deceased Greeley, but rather split them among four other candidates . Congress did not count the three votes that were cast for a dead man. Pictured is American abolitionist, journalist and politician Horace Greeley, who edited the New York Tribune. MPI/Getty Images In the more than 150 years since Greeley’s death, there have been two constitutional amendments related to presidential succession, but there is still some gray area when it comes to an unforeseen event that strikes a presidential nominee or candidate. Today, polling suggests voters are worried that both Trump and Biden are too old for the job. Trump will be 78 on Election Day in November, and Biden will turn 82 later that month. Without being macabre, it’s worth knowing what would happen if, for whatever reason, either man was unable to continue with the race. Replacing either man on the ballot – not that anyone is seriously talking about it – would be a messy and chaotic process that would uncover divisions and disagreements within the political parties. No one knows for sure what would happen if a candidate died or for some reason needed to withdraw from the race. Here’s a look at the rules for Republicans and Democrats as they currently stand. What happens if a candidate cannot continue his or her campaign? The process of replacing a presidential candidate very much depends on when the vacancy occurs – during the primary process and before the party convention; during the convention or after the convention; or before or after people vote in November. What happens if a vacancy occurs during the primary process? While Trump and Biden are in total command of the respective races to be the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, that process will play out between now and June as states conduct primaries and caucuses and assign delegates based on the results. If a vacancy on either side happens before most of those primaries were to occur, it’s possible that another candidate could emerge and rack up some delegates. But since filing deadlines have already passed for many primaries, it’s unlikely any single candidate, other than Trump or Biden, could rack up enough delegates to win the nomination before party conventions this summer. It is, however, possible that states could decide to delay their primaries, according to Elaine Kamarck , a member of the Democratic National Committee rules committee and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied the issue. Republicans will hold their convention in Milwaukee in July, and Democrats will hold theirs just to the south in Chicago in August. Most delegates will have been awarded by the end of March. Biden has not faced serious opposition in the Democratic primary, has won every delegate at stake so far and needs to win at least 1,968 of 3,934 to secure the nomination on the first ballot of voting. On the Republican side, Trump has won every contest so far and ultimately needs 1,215 of 2,429 delegates. His top rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, is far behind Trump in the delegate race. What if a vacancy occurs after the primaries and before or during the convention? If the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would likely decide the party’s nominee on the convention floor. That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. There would be a messy political battle in every state over who would get to be a delegate (if the vacancy happened before many of those people were chosen) and then who they would ultimately support. Even people who did not run primary campaigns could ultimately be considered. You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to be on the ballot if, for some reason, Biden left the race. At the same time, given Haley’s weakness in primaries, it seems unlikely that Republicans would coalesce around her if Trump was unable to run. On the Democratic side, there would also be another group to consider: the “superdelegates,” a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can’t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they’re free to vote on subsequent ballots. Has anything like this ever happened before? The modern primary and caucus system evolved only in recent generations as voters demanded more involvement in the nominating process. The election that sparked change was in 1968, when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run after an embarrassing finish in New Hampshire’s primary. Johnson won, but just barely. When he dropped out of the presidential race, it set off a chaotic dash to replace him. One candidate who jumped in the race, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Los Angeles just after winning the California primary, creating the difficult question of who his delegates should support. The ultimate Democratic winner that year, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, amassed his delegates in states that did not conduct primaries, securing enough support to win the nomination. Violence on the streets of Chicago around the convention marred the event and helped inspire the system of primaries and caucuses we have today where voters pick presidential candidates through delegates bound to support a specific candidate. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party’s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrats – The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership. Republicans – If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth Congressional Research Service memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party’s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party’s nominee. Neither party, according to CRS, requires that the presidential candidate’s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, but that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health). The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern’s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-biden-election-2024/index.html,"CNN — President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are each offering a stark glimpse at the political liabilities that have many Americans wishing they had other options in 2024. Biden, 81, is angrily refuting questions about his age and memory, struggling to lay to rest anxiety among voters that he wouldn’t be capable of serving a full second term. But far from exploiting the president’s rough patch, Trump offered a stunning display of extremism at the weekend, raising fresh questions over his fitness for the Oval Office. The comparison between the likely general election opponents helps explain why polls show limited enthusiasm for both men, each of whom is unpopular outside their core constituencies. Biden would be the more conventional choice because Trump is promising one of the most tumultuous second terms in US history. But as the president’s campaign gathers pace, his troubles are complicating his effort to convince Americans that Trump would destroy American democracy and would shatter the country’s reputation abroad. Trump is giving every impression that his second term would be even more aberrant than his first, as he vows to use presidential power to exact retribution against his enemies. But he’s nevertheless closely matched with Biden in polling and has a real chance to win. While a Biden vs. Trump race would be a rematch of 2020, it would not necessarily be the same. The sitting president is four years older, and age questions are even more acute. And Trump is even more radical and unchained than when he left office. How Biden and Trump are putting their political weaknesses on display The different liabilities both would bring to the race were on display during the frantic last few days. In Trump, voters can pick an ex-president facing 91 criminal charges who has been found liable for fraud, sexual battery and defamation in court. Trump, 77, tried to stay in power after losing reelection in 2020. This weekend, Trump sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over NATO allies and mocked the military service of GOP rival Nikki Haley’s husband. This week, the ex-president faces a set of court deadlines and hearings that will renew the focus on his seemingly endless threats to the rule of law. In Biden, voters must decide whether to reelect the oldest president ever, at 81, who is angrily refuting claims of a declining memory following a damning assessment of his faculties by a special counsel. The president, who warns Trump is a danger to democracy , is visibly aging while mixing up the names of foreign leaders , and polls show overwhelming skepticism among the public about his reelection plans. The key question voters will face is not whether Biden is fit to serve as commander in chief now, but rather: Will he still be by the end of a second term, when he would be 86? Multiple polls have shown how little voters like the alternatives they will almost certainly get in the 2024 election. And while partisans may already be locked in, the comparison between the sitting president and the former one, both of whom crave a second term, will be critical in the handful of swing states where a relatively small number of voters will be decisive. The debate over Biden’s age and Trump’s fitness for office help explain why there’s a possibility that several third-party or independent candidates — for instance, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — could have an outsize impact on the destiny of the White House. But while speculation will mount about how either party might thwart a 2020 election replay, practical impediments make the idea of dumping a potential nominee an almost unthinkable scenario. Trump’s wild weekend tear Over the weekend, Trump showed how his uncontrolled stream of rhetoric and insults can often be politically counterproductive and play into the core narratives of Biden’s campaign. In a shocking remark at a rally in South Carolina on Saturday, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that didn’t meet the alliance’s guidelines for defense spending. Trump’s comments reveal his view of NATO not as the main driver of peace in Europe for half a century but as a protection racket. His comments are also dangerous, since the alliance’s credibility relies on Russia believing that members would defend an ally that was attacked, in line with Article 5 commitments. Any sense this is false could lead to miscalculations in Moscow. And this is just the latest in a long list of occasions in which the ex-president has appeared to indulge Putin’s goals instead of traditional US national interests. Biden warned in a statement that his likely opponent was unsuitable to be commander in chief. “Donald Trump’s admission that he intends to give Putin a greenlight for more war and violence, to continue his brutal assault against a free Ukraine, and to expand his aggression to the people of Poland and the Baltic States are appalling and dangerous,” Biden said. Trump’s defenders insist his comments are merely a ruse to get NATO members — some of whom are still short of their targets — to spend more on defense. Defense spending rose in some cases following Trump’s pressure in his first term — although his ranting about NATO members not paying their “bills” was not the only factor. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who was a conventional hawkish conservative when he ran against Trump in 2016, defended the ex-president Sunday. “Donald Trump is not a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,” Rubio said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “He doesn’t talk like a traditional politician, and we’ve already been through this. You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.” Still, Trump caused alarm in Europe. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, called his remarks “reckless.” And Trump’s statement will refuel speculation about the odd nature of his relationship with Putin, who is accused of war crimes and has directly targeted civilians in Ukraine. It will also renew fears that Trump would try to pull the US out of NATO if he’s reelected, which would delight Russia. Trump’s comments also come as his GOP allies, especially in the House, are trying to thwart Biden’s new aid package for Ukraine, a sovereign democracy invaded by the Russian autocrat in the widest European land war since World War II. And the sympathetic interview of Putin last week by Tucker Carlson, the far-right populist broadcaster, only underscores the Trump GOP’s embrace of Putinism. Former President Donald Trump speaks in Conway, South Carolina, on February 10, 2024. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Trump’s contempt for those who serve in the military — was also highlighted in his South Carolina speech. He asked of Haley’s husband, Michael: “Where is he? He’s gone,” apparently arguing that his rival’s spouse knew her campaign would not do well. Michael Haley is on a yearlong deployment in Africa. Nikki Haley targeted Trump on X, saying: “Michael is deployed serving our country, something you know nothing about. Someone who continually disrespects the sacrifices of military families has no business being commander in chief.” This is far from the first time that Trump has disparaged the military service of political opponents. He’s still attacking the late Arizona Sen. John McCain after mocking his incarceration and the injuries he sustained when his plane went down and he was tortured during the Vietnam War. Trump’s conduct was not just typical of the way he has crushed every tradition of presidential decorum. It also offered a potential roadmap to the substance and character of his possible second term. At the same time, Trump’s weekend eruptions also show why he may be a compromised general-election candidate. They played directly into Biden’s claims that he’s too extreme and too morally challenged to be president again. And Trump’s latest outbursts are politically self-defeating: They took attention away from Biden’s frantic attempts at damage control following special counsel Robert Hur’s devastating assessment of Biden as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Much has been written about the new, disciplined Trump campaign. But the ex-president is reminding voters of his volatile first term, which included two impeachments. Biden struggles to parry increasing worries about his age The White House and Biden’s allies spent the weekend fighting back following a late Thursday news conference at which the president vented about Hur’s findings. The event may have exacerbated Biden’s political problems since he mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico, following several similar occasions last week when he referred to long-dead European leaders with whom he interacted in the 1980s rather their more recent successors. The acute political problem Biden faces was underscored by a new ABC News/Ipsos poll published Sunday in which 86% of Americans said Biden was too old to serve another term. The figure includes 59% of Americans who think both he and Trump are too old and 27% who think only Biden is too old. President Joe Biden speaks at the White House on February 8, 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Here’s Biden’s problem: It’s politically corrosive when a critical narrative takes hold about a president and subsequent events appear to validate it. Every flub or mistake the president makes — after a lifetime of verbal slips and gaffes — now plays into the perception that he’s losing his grip mentally. And his age is a political problem that can’t be fixed. The danger is that voters who see him onstage begin to find it impossible to get past and therefore don’t judge him on his successes as president, his program for a second term or the comparison between him and Trump. Multiple Democrats have attested to Biden’s mental acuity since Thursday. “I have seen the president twice in the last two weeks,” Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” The California lawmaker added: “I have had a conversation with him. He’s completely mentally sharp when we were discussing the Middle East.” But when Biden’s allies are forced to talk about his age, they inevitably draw attention back to the biggest liability for a president who polls show is struggling to create enthusiasm among grassroots Democrats and who may have trouble in reunifying his 2020 coalition, especially when it comes to younger and minority voters. Many Democrats also believe Trump is getting a pass when it comes to age and mental sharpness. While Biden’s missteps get great attention, Trump’s speeches often degenerate into nonsensical reflections. He recently mixed up Haley and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And while his manic presentation style may look energetic and disguise his age in comparison with Biden’s, he’d also be an octogenarian in the White House if he wins a second term. Why the 2020 election lineup may be locked in The renewed focus on Biden’s age is likely to open another round of speculation about whether he could be replaced on the Democratic ticket. But barring some unforeseen health event or a late decision by Biden to fold his campaign, this is highly unlikely. For all the focus on the president’s liabilities, no younger Democrat, with the exception of his long-shot primary rival Rep. Dean Phillips , has emerged to challenge Biden, perhaps to avoid damaging their own political futures. Could the Democratic Party pick an alternative candidate at its summer convention? It’s unlikely. Biden controls the infrastructure of the party — his rejigging of the primary calendar to insulate himself from challenges is proof of that. There’s no sign any major party figure is willing to tell him to step aside or to organize any attempt to topple him. Any convention maneuvering would also follow months of primaries in which Democratic voters are likely to massively endorse Biden, so any attempt to topple him would fly in the face of the democratic principles that Democrats say they are trying to preserve. Had Vice President Kamala Harris been a striking success, there would be more pressure on Biden to yield to a younger successor. But her approval ratings are very low. Haley, for instance, sees Harris as such a political liability that she warns voters they could vote for Biden and get Harris as president. The time for moving on from Trump has also passed. Despite his four indictments, the ex-president’s dominance over Haley and other rivals in early nominating contests has crushed the notion that if only he faced a one-on-one fight, he’d be defeated by anti-Trump forces in the party. So it’s hard to see any way out of the choice America appears not to want. While there are are stark policy differences between Biden and Trump, the 2024 election could still come down to voters picking between Biden’s perceived declining capabilities and Trump’s wild, anti-democratic and autocratic instincts."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/senate-democrats-biden-election-analysis/index.html,"CNN — For Senate Democrats, 2024 is the year of living dangerously. In this fall’s Senate elections, Democrats will be defending more seats in precarious political terrain than in any other election during the 2020s. That list of challenging elections this year includes the final three Senate seats Democrats hold in states that voted for Donald Trump in 2020, and five more in states that President Joe Biden won by 3 percentage points or less. Meanwhile, Republicans this year are not defending any Senate seats in states that voted against Trump in 2020, or preferred him by 3 points or less. That math underlines the stakes for Democrats in Biden improving his position in the key swing states by November. One of the most powerful trends of modern Senate elections is that it has become exceedingly difficult for candidates in either party to win seats in states that usually vote the other way for president. The Senate Democrats running in difficult electoral terrain might break that trend this fall. Yet if they can’t, Biden’s fate in November could determine control of the Senate not only in 2025, but for years thereafter. A strong recovery by Biden in which he wins most of the key swing states could position Democrats to remain competitive in the battle for Senate control through the remainder of this decade, even if they narrowly lose the majority in November. But if Biden loses most of the swing states, Democrats could fall into a Senate deficit too large to realistically overcome for years — especially because the party has so few plausible opportunities to flip seats now held by the GOP. “If the bottom were to drop out for Biden, Democrats could lose the Senate for a long time,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the political newsletter “Sabato’s Crystal Ball,” which is published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. That prospect has enormous implications not only for the passage of legislation but also for the composition of the federal courts, especially the Supreme Court. Four of the Supreme Court justices will be older than 70 by 2028. Even if Biden holds the White House in 2024, and a vacancy arises, a durable Republican Senate majority might refuse to fill any of those seats — just as then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did while Barack Obama was president in 2016. “You can imagine Supreme Court seats going unfilled for years,” Kondik said. The default position for the Senate in the 21st century has been for small and fleeting majorities. In the 12 congressional sessions since 2001, one party or the other has reached 55 Senate seats only three times. By comparison, one party or the other won a majority of 55 or more Senate seats seven times in the 10 sessions from 1980 to 2000. Smaller majorities, not surprisingly, have proved more difficult to defend: In this century, control of the Senate has already flipped in the elections of 2002, 2006, 2014 and 2020. The principal reason the chamber has become so closely divided is the growing correlation between how states vote for president and how they vote for the Senate. That has limited the number of Senate seats each side can win absent unusual circumstances. Through the late 20th century, it was common for voters to split their tickets by electing senators from one party while voting for the presidential nominee of the other. After the 1984 election, for instance, Democrats still held about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for Ronald Reagan in both of his winning presidential campaigns. But now the alignment between presidential and Senate outcomes has become nearly complete. Heading into the 2024 election, Republicans hold 47 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Trump in 2020. Democrats, in turn, hold 48 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Biden last time. This surface equivalence in the two parties’ position in the Senate, though, masks a deeper divergence that largely explains the risk to Democrats this year. While Biden and Trump each won 25 states in 2020, Biden won far more of them by very narrow margins. As a result, Senate Democrats are much more dependent than Republicans on states that lean their way only slightly in the presidential contest. In 2020, Biden won three states by less than a single percentage point: Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. He won three others by less than 3 percentage points: Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan. Democrats now hold 11 of the 12 Senate seats from those six highly competitive states. (Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is the only Republican senator from these states.) President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally in Las Vegas on February 4, 2024. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images By contrast, among the 25 states that backed Trump, North Carolina — where Republicans hold both Senate seats — was the only one Trump carried by less than 3 percentage points. Even extending the net to states Trump won by less than 5 percentage points brings in only Florida, where Republicans also hold both Senate seats. This contrast creates a huge disparity between the parties. Democrats now hold 14 inherently vulnerable Senate seats: their three from the states Trump won in 2020, and their 11 in the states Biden won only narrowly. For Republicans the total is at most six: two in states that Biden won in 2020, and four in states that Trump won narrowly, even with Florida included. “When you have so many states where it is now inconceivable that they could go the other way, Democrats always have to get a straight flush,” said Michael Podhorzer , the former political director for the AFL-CIO. “They’ve got to run the table, because on the basis of what’s safe on either side in the Senate, or the Electoral College, they are at a huge disadvantage.” This year Democrats are defending five of their 11 seats in the states that Biden won by 3 points or less. That’s the biggest concentration of seats from those states Democrats must defend in any single election in this decade, from 2020 through 2028. This year’s Senate races in the narrow Biden states include Democratic incumbents Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, and Jacky Rosen in Nevada; also on the ballot is an open Democratic-held seat in Michigan (where the party is very likely to nominate Rep. Elissa Slotkin) and the Arizona seat held by Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sinema hasn’t indicated whether she will seek reelection, but Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is already running for the seat. (Democrats also face an unexpected challenge in Maryland — a state that leans much more reliably toward them in presidential elections — after GOP former Gov. Larry Hogan last week said he would run for the open seat there.) In addition, Democrats this year must defend all three of their remaining Senate seats in the states that voted for Trump in 2020. That includes incumbents Jon Tester in Montana, Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and the open seat being vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin in West Virginia. Neither of the two remaining Senate Republicans in states that Biden won last time (Susan Collins in Maine and Johnson in Wisconsin) are up this year; nor are either of the GOP senators from North Carolina, the state Trump won by his smallest margin. Both parties agree the open West Virginia seat is virtually guaranteed to flip to the GOP. Tester and Brown both have strong personal brands, but Biden is almost certain to lose their states, and possibly by substantial margins. If he does, Brown and Tester could survive only by breaking a nearly inviolate recent pattern in presidential election years. In 2016, for the first time ever, every Senate race was won by the same party that carried the presidential contest in that state. In 2020, every Senate race again followed the presidential outcome — except in Maine, where Collins won reelection despite Biden’s victory there. This pattern proved especially frustrating to Democrats, who raised enormous sums in 2020 for Senate candidates in Republican-leaning states such as Kentucky, South Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Montana and Texas. Yet when Trump comfortably carried those states in November, all of those Democratic Senate candidates lost as well. A man votes on Election Day on November 3, 2020, in Charleston, South Carolina. Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images This year, with West Virginia likely already gone, if either Brown or Tester loses, it would be very difficult for Democrats to maintain their Senate majority into 2025. The only Republican senators they might plausibly oust to offset those losses are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas. Democrats have recruited strong challengers to each of them, but both of those races clearly lean toward the GOP, especially in a presidential election year. But if Democrats can hold down their Senate losses to some (or even all) of their three seats in the states Trump won in 2020, they would emerge with a deficit small enough to overcome in upcoming elections. The real long-term risk for the party this November is losing several of their Senate seats in the states Biden narrowly carried last time. (Hogan’s bid in Maryland adds a wild card, but the probability that Biden wins Maryland will likely leave Hogan as an underdog despite his personal popularity.) If Democrats lose Senate seats in the narrow Biden states, they simply have very few places on the map to replace them, given the parties’ patterns of support. It’s that prospect that has led the Democratic data analyst David Shor to warn for years that if the party doesn’t perform well in the 2024 presidential election, the GOP could seize control of the Senate for a sustained period. Shor would not comment on the Democrats’ Senate situation, but many other analysts see a dangerous convergence: The party must defend an unusually large number of seats in terrain that is highly contested at the presidential level precisely as Biden is struggling in polls against Trump. “There is a real downside risk that if the presidential election goes poorly, the Republicans could not only win the Senate but build something of a cushion that would be hard for Democrats to cut into in the near future,” Kondik said. Gene Ulm, a Republican pollster who has worked for many Senate candidates, agrees that what happens in the narrow Biden 2020 states this fall will cast a huge shadow on control of the Senate through the decade. If Republicans capture Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, he said, the reaction in the political world would not be “gosh, shock, alert the media,” he said. “It’s one thing for Republicans to recapture those states that have been habitually red,” Ulm said, but “if all of a sudden you have Republicans winning places that are historically purple,” that creates a very different situation going forward. The best-case scenario for Democrats is that Biden recovers enough to win most or all of the five battleground states where the party is also defending Senate seats. Many on both sides agree that it will be difficult for Republicans to flip any of those Democratic-held seats if Biden wins the state — with Arizona a possible exception if Sinema creates a three-way race. Of the Democrats running in the narrow Biden states, Casey in Pennsylvania and Baldwin in Wisconsin are probably best positioned to win even the president he loses their state, many in both parties agree. Brown and Tester also have deep roots that could allow them to survive Biden defeats as well. But in this era of greater party-line voting, it won’t be easy for any candidate to overcome such an undertow: Hardly any Senate Democrats in competitive races ran even 2 percentage points ahead of Biden’s vote share in 2020. Ulm sees two keys to the Senate outcomes in the competitive swing states. One is the choices in the Senate races by voters who back third-party presidential candidates out of distaste for both Biden and Trump, assuming they face each other again; it is very difficult at this point, Ulm said, to predict how those disaffected voters will vote in Senate (and House) races. For Ulm, the other key question is what happens with the voters who are slightly negative about Biden. He is confident Republican Senate candidates will romp among voters who strongly disapprove of Biden, as they did in 2022. But one reason Democrats blunted the anticipated 2022 red wave is their congressional and gubernatorial candidates ran unusually well among voters who only “somewhat disapproved” of Biden — largely because many of those voters considered the Trump-allied GOP alternatives too extreme. Electoral workers process ballots in Easton, Pennsylvania, on November 3, 2020. Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images That risk to the GOP remains. “The soft disapprovers are going to be a much more competitive constituency, just like 2022,” Ulm said. David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, notes that in the 2022 midterm election, Democrats won Senate races in most of these same battleground states, although exit polls showed substantial discontent with the economy and Biden’s performance then, too. “Senate campaigns are candidate versus candidate battles,” Bergstein said. “We have the superior candidates, and Republicans are putting forward candidates who have big flaws, who lost races before, or are facing the prospect of damaging primaries. Certainly a presidential cycle is different than a midterm, but the laws of Senate campaigns, where candidate quality matters, are still in effect.” Gary Jacobson, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of California at San Diego who specializes in Congress, said that given the fissures opening in each party’s coalition during the Trump era, no one should rule out the possibility that either side may develop new opportunities that reconfigure the Senate’s precarious balance. “This structural disadvantage the Democrats have is a real thing and it will make it an uphill battle for them to control the Senate for the foreseeable future,” Jacobson said. “But the foreseeable future is pretty short. Political configurations are not cut in stone.” Unless and until such a new political configuration emerges, both parties can realistically target many fewer Senate seats than they could even two decades ago. But the ceiling is clearly lower for Democrats than for Republicans. It leaves Democrats, even in good years, with achingly little margin for error to build a Senate majority. And unless Biden recovers more strength, 2024 may be very far from anything Democrats would call a good year."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — As the two-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, it feels like everyone has been sucked into a bizarro world. ► Two years ago, in February 2022, Tucker Carlson was a Fox News host, still adjacent to mainstream US politics. ► US support for Ukraine seemed ironclad and unflappable as Russia invaded. ► Russian President Vladimir Putin was about to be isolated worldwide as a pariah. ► Elon Musk would soon commit to helping Ukraine with his Starlink satellite internet system. ► Former President Donald Trump was still plotting his way out of the political wilderness, his presence rarely felt by most of the country. What a difference two years makes Some developments this week: ► Putin got a platform, thanks to a softball interview by Carlson, who was banished from Fox News last year and has turned to Twitter, the platform Musk bought and renamed X, to spew right-wing conspiracy theories. ► American aid for Ukraine is in real question as US politicians, led by Republicans in the House of Representatives, question the investment. Note: When Trump helped kill a bipartisan border policy bill this week, it also put Ukraine aid sought for months by President Joe Biden in jeopardy. ► Trump’s emergence from the wilderness is complete. He has all but erased any question he will be the Republican presidential nominee for the third time and is plotting his return to the White House. The Pentagon, by the way, is now paying Musk’s SpaceX for Ukraine to use Starlink. Video Ad Feedback Russia expert says this is what Putin hoped to get from Carlson interview 02:06 - Source: CNN A propaganda broadcast on X Carlson was walked on by Putin during the interview in Moscow. CNN’s Oliver Darcy called it a “propaganda victory” for Putin. From Darcy: Instead of pressing Putin on the many topics at hand, including credible accusations Russia has committed war crimes and the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Carlson allowed the autocrat a free lane to manipulate the public and tell his version of history, no matter how deceptive it may have been. At times, between the airing of grievances, Putin appeared to school Carlson on historical events as the host looked on in bewilderment. Or to put it more plainly, Carlson provided Putin a platform to spread his propaganda to a global audience with little to no scrutiny of his claims. In one notable exchange, Carlson did push back on the idea that Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia since last March, is a US spy. According to CNN’s reporting, Russia rejected an offer to exchange a large number of Russian nationals detained abroad for both Gershkovich and another American, Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since 2018. Putin told Carlson that perhaps Gershkovich could be exchanged for Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel in Russia’s domestic spying service who was convicted for murdering a former Chechen fighter in Berlin in broad daylight in 2019. CNN’s Nathan Hodge, Katharina Krebs and Helen Regan have more details . They also fact-check Carlson on his assertion that US media organizations have not tried to interview Putin. From their report: In fact, journalists have repeatedly been requesting interviews with Putin, but the Russian president had declined to grant access. And Putin not only has declined to participate in interviews with the free press, but over the past two years he has waged a war against the media, locking up journalists , fining Big Tech companies for hosting “fake” information about the Ukraine invasion, and pushing through censorship laws that clamp down on news organizations. Video Ad Feedback Amanpour pushes back on Tucker Carlson's claim about Putin interview 02:13 - Source: CNN Putin, despite the free platform from Carlson, still faces isolation in the West. The CNN reporters note the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin regarding an alleged scheme to take Ukrainian children to Russia. And there was a new call Thursday for Putin to face a war crimes inquiry for Russia’s assault on the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which killed thousands. The reporters also used the word “revanchist,” which I had to look up and which perfectly describes Putin’s warped view of history and his obsession with occupying Ukraine. From Merriam-Webster: (re·​vanch·​ist) of or relating to a policy designed to recover lost territory or status. Shakeup in Ukraine Meantime, there are major developments in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky this week replaced his top military commander, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. From CNN’s report : The president’s move follows tensions between Zelensky and his hugely popular military chief after the failure of Ukraine’s much-vaunted counteroffensive, and with Ukraine facing a renewed Russian onslaught, manpower and ammunition shortages, and US aid stalled in Congress. Major choices for Americans But among the many, concrete choices Americans face in November, assuming the presidential election is between Trump and Biden, is how the US president will approach Putin. Biden has his built his presidency around the idea of a worldwide struggle between democracies and autocracies. Trump frequently expresses admiration for autocrats and his frustration with democratic alliances like NATO. Ukraine funding has run dry The Pentagon has essentially exhausted the money Congress allocated for Ukraine over the past two years. It’s unclear when more might be on the way, particularly after the proposal to tie US border policy to Ukraine funding met its end this week. In the Senate, there is support for Ukraine aid. A bipartisan group of senators on Thursday cleared a 60-vote threshold to move toward a $95 billion aid bill for Ukraine and Israel. One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, plans to use arcane procedural tactics to stall a final vote for days . Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, pushed back against criticism from right-wing lawmakers that the money is charity for Ukraine. Most of the funds would be spent on production of military hardware in the US, he said. “This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy and demonstrating to our allies and adversaries alike that we’re serious about exercising American strength,” he said on the Senate floor on Friday. The House is a more formidable roadblock to additional Ukraine funding. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has not ruled out the idea of approving a Ukraine bill, either as a stand-alone proposition or in conjunction with aid to Israel. But he has certainly not endorsed it either. Johnson, along with other Republicans, has demanded more transparency and accountability for how the money is spent. And to get more aid passed into law, he would likely need Democratic votes – which will anger hard-line Republicans who have the power to oust him."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/politics/biden-age-concerns-analysis/index.html,"CNN — A probe that spared President Joe Biden from criminal charges paradoxically dealt him a threatening political blow. Special counsel Robert Hur’s report released Thursday on Biden’s handling of classified documents effectively ended the matter. But his assertions that Biden was elderly and forgetful ignited a political firestorm that cut directly to the heart of the president’s chief vulnerability in the 2024 election. The White House knew it had a huge political problem on its hands. undefined — President Joe Biden speaks in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, Thursday, Feb. 8, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Evan Vucci/AP Related article Takeaways from special counsel’s report into Biden’s handling of classified documents After hours of Republican claims that the report showed he wasn’t capable of serving as president, Biden appeared at a hastily scheduled news conference Thursday evening, apparently seeking to turn the page on what turned into a disastrous day. “I know what the hell I am doing,” Biden fumed in the Diplomatic Room of the White House, as he defended his faculties and bristled with anger. Biden also pointed out that Hur’s report drew distinctions between his handling of classified material and Donald Trump ’s allegedly criminal and obstructive conduct on the same issue over which the ex-president faces a future criminal trial. Biden appeared fired up and passionate. But at the same time, his angry demeanor and an event which appeared to quickly spin out of his control, with reporters shouting questions as he struggled to interrupt, may have ended up exacerbating the very questions about his age that it was meant to dispel. When CNN’s MJ Lee pointed out that many voters have questions about his age, Biden pointed his finger and forcibly said, “That’s your judgment.” Story highlights Biden's age and acuity matter to voters and he is under increasing pressure to address this and demonstrate his capacity as the general election approaches. Age is an issue that many families have to wrestle with and so understand intuitively, a factor that may be reflected in public opinion on the matter as it relates to the election. This is a delicate issue that has not been fully tackled either by the White House or the Biden campaign. The press event also raised new questions about his sharpness in a week in which he has twice confused the names of a serving and recent European leader with those with whom he interacted in the 1980s. At one point in his Thursday night appearance, Biden was referring to the president of Egypt in a comment about the Middle East crisis but mistakenly said “the president of Mexico.” This is the kind of mistake any overworked politician might make. And even when he was much younger, Biden had a reputation as a gaffe machine and for verbal slips. But in the context of Biden’s declaration that his “memory is fine” his political liability over his age and coming as it did during an event meant to demonstrate vitality and accurate recall, it was an unwelcome trip-up, to say the least. An emotional moment There was also a poignant moment where palpable grief came to the surface when the president condemned Hur for suggesting that in an interview he struggled to remember the date of his beloved son Beau’s death. It’s hard to think of a more painful thing for Biden to have to read since he remains deeply affected by his son’s passing from brain cancer in 2015. “How the hell dare he raise that?” Biden asked, before breaking off, apparently close to tears. Overall, Biden left an impression of a president who feels he’s been deeply wronged, is bitter about the way he is covered by the media and treated by Republicans and still believes deeply he is the best option to beat Trump in November — an opponent that he views as an anti-democratic anathema to everything America stands for. The president’s defenders often get frustrated when the political conversation is dominated by Biden’s age – rather than Trump’s repeated challenges to the rule of law.

Sure, Biden’s likely Republican opponent is a twice-impeached 77-year-old with a volcanic temperament who is facing 91 charges and tried to thwart US democracy three years ago. But Biden is the president now, and despite the preferred framing of his campaign that 2024 is a direct comparison between him and Trump, he will be judged on his own record and capability to serve as commander-in-chief for a full four years, especially as Vice President Kamala Harris has her own questions to answer about her experience, popularity and suitability to serve in the Oval Office. In a CNN/SSRS poll published in November, only 25% of Americans believed Biden had the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively, while 53% said Trump did. In another CNN poll last week, 46% of Democrats were concerned about Biden’s age. This is a delicate issue that has not been fully tackled either by the White House or the Biden campaign and is often rationalized away by Democrats and in Washington in a way that does not fully reflect the depth of feeling about it in the nation as a whole. The fact that Biden delivered his remarks on Thursday night shows that his team now recognizes the president has a significant liability in this area but his performance also suggests that he’s yet to fully work out how to put voters at ease. A painful issue Age and the question of diminished capacities as a person heads into their twilight years is a deeply painful and sensitive one. It’s something that many families have to wrestle with and so understand intuitively, a factor that may be reflected in public opinion on the matter as it relates to the election. Many of the attacks on Biden by Republicans certainly reek of ageism and come across as cruel. As Biden knows however, politics is a nasty, personal business. In mitigation, he has kept up a rigorous schedule on the campaign trail in recent weeks traveling coast-to-coast and last year conducted several grueling foreign trips that would have tired a much younger man. But the pressures of the presidency are unrelenting and offer little time for true mental relief. This is underscored by the fact that Biden is for example dealing with two wars in Ukraine and Gaza that constantly threaten to spill out of control and embroil the world in a much wider conflict. Biden’s fans may also have a case that he’s being unfairly compared with Trump. The ex-president — despite a few recent glaring gaffes himself — notably mixing up his GOP rival Nikki Haley with ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — has not had the same scrutiny over age even though he’d be into his 80s by the end of his own second term if he wins in November. Trump’s often nonsensical remarks, verbal gaffes and frequently unhinged demeanor are often cited by Democrats and raise questions about his age and capacity. But Trump’s manic energy tends to dampen such questions among his supporters, although there are arguably great red flags about his fitness for office raised by his four looming criminal trials and his open autocratic tendencies and vows to use a second term to enact personal “retribution” against his political enemies. Hur’s report rebuked Biden for willfully retaining classified information, including top secret documents after he left the vice presidency. But he said no charges were called for because there was insufficient evidence of willful intent to prove guilt without reasonable doubt. He also also drew a distinction between Biden’s handling of classified material after documents were found at his home, his garage and in an office that he used and Trump’s hoarding of classified material at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Biden cooperated with his probe while Trump is alleged to have done the opposite, according to a criminal indictment that also accuses him of obstruction. The facts show that there are huge differences in the cases of Biden and Trump — even if the nuance will be blurred in the heat of a campaign as GOP leaders complain of double standards in the justice system. But the GOP’s real opening came when Hur suggested that Biden would come across to a jury as a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man “with a poor memory.” Hur suggested that he had frequent memory lapses during his interviews with investigators, including not being able to recall when Beau died or exactly when Biden was vice president. The special counsel also said the president could not remember details of a debate over Afghanistan that appeared very important to him. Biden’s lawyers lashed out at such details as inappropriate. Biden’s allies suggested that as Hur was appointed as a district attorney in Maryland by Trump he may have a political ax to grind. In private, the findings touched off a furious response from Biden, with the president angrily and profanely asking how anyone could believe he would forget the day his son died, CNN’s Kevin Liptak reported . Many of the Republican attacks on Biden were biting. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio suggested on Twitter for instance that he was suffering from dementia. North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis was kinder but his comments over Biden’s age were also cutting. “I’m not one who gets personal. But when it’s so profound, that you have a prosecutor take note of it, I think it’s something to pay attention to,” Tillis said. “I’m not trying to take a cheap shot. …  Let’s say that was the CEO of a company. What would their board of directors be asking for this evening?” The reality of an unprecedented election Democrats moved quickly to dismiss concerns about Biden. “In my interactions with the president, which I have regularly, I’ve not experienced anything like that,” said Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. “When I came back from Ukraine the last time, I spent a good amount of time with him on the phone, talking about Ukraine and the details, and he was sharp.” But the fact Democrats even have to address this, points to Biden’s big political problem. And the entire situation is replete with irony. Biden acted aggressively Thursday to try to prevent a report that lifted the threat of criminal prosecution from him but already appears to have damaged him politically because of questions about his age. Trump meanwhile is facing four criminal trials that paradoxically appear to have benefitted him politically — at least with his deeply loyal base which has bought into his claims that he’s a victim of political persecution. That may not seem fair. But for Biden, it comes with being an incumbent president in his 80s who is facing genuine questions from the public about his capacity to serve. This also reflects the sometimes warped reality of politics in the age of Trump and an unprecedented election between two elderly likely opponents in November, each of whom have served an Oval Office term and have defied the efforts of a younger generation to succeed them."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/politics/donald-trump-supreme-court-2024-analysis/index.html,"CNN — Few critical US democratic institutions have escaped unsullied from a tangle with Donald Trump . Now, the US Supreme Court faces its greatest test so far from the former president. Photo illustration by Will Mullery/CNN/Getty Images Related article Your questions about the Supreme Court and Trump, answered On Thursday, the nine justices will hear a case with critical implications for the 2024 election – over the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to remove Trump from the ballot over the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist” clause . By early next week, the Supreme Court may also be considering whether to hear another Trump appeal, against a lower court decision to reject his demand for absolute presidential immunity over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election following his false claims of voter fraud. The pair of hugely significant and politically charged cases could thrust the justices deeper into a presidential election than at any time since the court decided the disputed 2000 election in favor of then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush over then-Vice President Al Gore. The historic reverberations from its new venture into campaign politics may echo even longer than the case that ended a bitter post-election period a quarter of a century ago. And given Trump’s habitual refusal to accept the rules and results of elections, no one would be surprised if the court is dragged deeper into the partisan fray before or after November’s presidential election, presuming Trump becomes the Republican nominee. Story highlights The pair of hugely significant and politically charged cases could thrust the justices deeper into a presidential election than at any time since the court decided the disputed 2000 election. Trump repeatedly sets out to lean on or discredit institutions that can hold him accountable, restrain his power or contradict his incessantly spun alternative realities. The perception that law enforcement has overreached against Trump has only solidified his supporters’ sympathy for him. The idea that the Supreme Court is above politics has long been rather quaint given generations of sensitive decisions on politicized issues, including slavery, voting rights, civil rights, desegregation, interracial and same-sex marriage, health care and recently abortion. But no modern president has gone further than Trump in daring to shatter the notion that judges are obligated to pursue a higher calling than partisan politics – preserving the rule of law. The four-times criminally indicted Trump repeatedly sets out to lean on or discredit institutions that can hold him accountable, restrain his power or contradict his incessantly spun alternative realities. He draws them into his vitriol and falsehoods in a way that has harmed their purported reputations for being above the fray. When he loses an election, he claims it’s rigged; when the press reports the truth, he blasts the “fake news”; when he’s investigated, he claims it’s a witch hunt; when he’s indicted, he warns the grand jury is biased; when he loses a case, he condemns the entire court system as corrupt. The mantra of victimization is now at the center of a presidential campaign based on the perception that he’s being politically persecuted and is driving his determination to dedicate a second term to retribution. How Trump works the refs Even though Trump is not expected to attend Thursday’s oral arguments at the Supreme Court, the justices know what’s coming. The 14th Amendment was passed by Congress June 13, 1866, and ratified July 9, 1868. National Archives Related article What to know about Trump and the 14th Amendment’s ‘insurrectionist ban’ During his high-profile trials, the ex-president has worked relentlessly to discredit the legitimacy of courts and judges. In his civil fraud trial in New York, for instance, he frequently clashed with the judge, and lambasted him, his staff and the case in regular breaks outside the court room. Trump last month stormed out of a trial over a defamation case brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll — shortly before a jury awarded her a stunning $83 million victory. After an appeals court in Washington, DC, this week rejected Trump’s extraordinary and anti-constitutional claims of total immunity over his attempts to overthrow the 2020 election, the former president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., attacked the legitimacy of the judges who ruled unanimously. “No one who’s been watching is shocked by this partisan hackery but here we go,” he wrote on X. “Time for SCOTUS to step in.” In several of the cases that the elder Trump is involved in, judges have imposed gag orders to protect the integrity of the proceedings. The ex-president’s power over his supporters is such that millions of them readily accept his falsehoods, coming to believe key institutions of government are corrupt. That leaves America’s political system and the rule of law more compromised than before. The result is that many voters, at least in his political base, discount the gravity of Trump’s alleged offenses. Video Ad Feedback 'That's leadership': Iowa voters react to Trump's comment on being a dictator 01:16 - Source: CNN According to a CNN poll conducted late last month, 49% of Republicans say Trump did nothing wrong following the last presidential election. While 40% said his actions were unethical, just 11% said that they were illegal. Many of Trump’s voters believe they have been let down by the government or have lost faith in institutions, authority figures and experts. Trump’s success in portraying his legal travails as one huge conspiracy plays into these feelings and threatens to inflict long-term damage on the country’s democratic institutions. A legal system that is regarded as bent and biased cannot long retain the confidence of its citizens. The perception that law enforcement has overreached against Trump has only solidified his supporters’ sympathy for him. The prospect of being dragged into the hyper-politicized arena of a presidential election is a nightmare enough for Chief Justice John Roberts , who has often sought to guard the high court against reputational damage from the country’s raging politics. Kenneth Fowler/CNN Related article ‘Judged by history’: Trump’s 14th Amendment fight at Supreme Court poses an enormous test for John Roberts But an election case involving Trump, in a time of far greater partisan fury than the bitter aftermath of the 2000 election, could be an even graver matter – especially if any of the court’s rulings eventually go against Trump. The former president doesn’t play by the same moral codes as Gore, who gracefully swallowed his anger and accepted his electoral loss after the ruling in Bush v. Gore. In the past, the high court’s adverse rulings against Trump have been greeted with sharp criticism from the former president. He has also suggested that the failure of the three justices he nominated – Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – to do what he wants is a symptom of disloyalty. That attitude underscores Trump’s transactional nature and his obliviousness to the duty of judges to the law. “I’m not happy with the Supreme Court. They love to rule against me. I picked three people. I fought like hell for them,” Trump said in his notorious January 6, 2021, speech in Washington that proceeded the mob attack on the US Capitol – which is at the root of both of the cases swirling around the president that the court is expected to face. “It almost seems that they’re all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country. To hurt our country,” Trump went on, referring to the justices. Video Ad Feedback 14th Amendment case: How we got here 02:54 - Source: CNN Trump echoed those remarks ahead of the Iowa caucuses last month, as he opened an effort to work the referees – or the conservative justices on the Supreme Court – with regard to the Colorado case. He claimed that judges appointed by Democratic presidents were brazenly partisan and moaned that those picked by Republican presidents didn’t follow suit. “When you are a Republican judge, and you have been appointed by, let’s say Trump, they go out of their way to hurt you, so that they can show that they have been fair, fair, honorable people. It’s an amazing difference.” Trump went on, “It’s a different wiring system or something – but all I want is fair, I fought really hard to get really three very, very good people … I just hope that they are going to be fair because the other side plays the ref.” How Trump leans on judges Any judge that delivers verdicts contradictory to Trump’s view risks becoming a target. Video Ad Feedback Trump posts 'Thanksgiving message' at 2 a.m. with a list of insults 01:30 - Source: CNN The former president’s attack on a district judge that ruled against the Trump administration in an asylum case prompted Roberts in 2019 to try to insulate the judiciary from politics. “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” Roberts wrote in an extraordinary statement that did not name Trump, but clearly had him in mind. “What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.” Ever since, including in several cases in which the justices declined to hear or rejected Trump’s allegations about the 2020 election, he has had a tense relationship with the high court. CNN’s senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic reported in her book “Nine Black Robes” that Roberts became increasingly skeptical of policies from a Trump administration that repeatedly stretched the limits of the law. For instance, Biskupic wrote that Roberts switched his vote to seal a 5-4 ruling against Trump’s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form. And Biskupic also pointed out how Roberts quietly brokered strong majorities against Trump’s attempts to keep his personal tax and other financial records from the Manhattan district attorney and, separately, committees of the US House of Representatives. After Trump’s presidency, he and the high court were again at odds. The justices blocked Trump’s bid to stop the release of presidential records to a House committee investigating the January 6 attack, for instance. None of these cases will bear on how the court rules in the Colorado case, and if it decides whether to take up Trump’s likely appeal on the immunity matter. But history shows that however the court rules, Trump’s response will be filtered through his highly developed sense of injustice and suspicion of institutions of accountability and his often self-serving interpretation of the law."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/south-carolina-trump-haley-voters/index.html,"Pawleys Island, South Carolina CNN — Joy Rendulic was hesitant when her husband first suggested a move to South Carolina. Then she visited a small ice cream shop for sale near the spectacular coast of this barrier island town. Rendulic cashed in her 401(k) to buy it, and left Erie, Pennsylvania, behind. “God brought me here,” Rendulic told us during a break at Island Treats ice cream shop. “I thought I was doing what I was supposed to be doing for the rest of my life, and he had a different plan. We think we are in control. But we’re not.” The big move was in 2016. Nikki Haley was the governor then, and newcomer Rendulic was impressed. “Yes, she was a very good governor,” Rendulic said. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, in December 2023. Carlos Barria/Reuters/File Related article CNN Poll: Most Americans want verdict on Trump election subversion charges before 2024 vote Donald Trump won her vote for president that same year, again in 2020 and will once more when Trump and Haley square off in the South Carolina GOP presidential primary this month. “I totally believe that God has assigned him to this position,” Rendulic said of Trump.  “That is my true belief.” We ask what happened in 2020. “That was a mess,” Rendulic said. “That was so illegal. Some improper cheating happening to the voting procedures.” We mention all the recounts and court cases Trump lost, including cases decided by judges Trump appointed, that upheld now-President Joe Biden’s victory. “I think so many people hate Trump,” she said. “I just know there was a whole lot of cheating.” There is no evidence of that, but Rendulic is adamant. So we ask, if it was God’s plan for Trump to be president, why would God let that happen? The answer is halting. “What happened is what happened. And I believe Trump is coming again.” Rendulic represents an important slice of the Trump base: for Trump no matter what. These voters echo his false claims about rigged elections and bogus investigations and they stand by Trump even when he does things counter to their priorities. You find a lot of them in South Carolina, one reason Trump consistently leads the primary polls despite Haley’s home state status. Rendulic, for example, lists abortion – or the “right to life,” as she puts it – as the reason her last vote for a Democrat for president was Jimmy Carter. But she offers no criticism of Trump when we point out he has recently criticized some state abortion restrictions as too harsh and has warned it could be a losing issue for Republicans. “I haven’t thought about that too much, probably,” Rendulic said. “I want it to be right to life.” No doubt Trump gets her vote. “He’s even more ready now and very, very intelligent, cares a lot about this country,” she said. “Wants to do what is right.” Looking for a tough border ‘fix’ from Trump Billy Pierce is another piece of the Trump comeback puzzle. He has lived in Hartsville – about two hours inland from the South Carolina coast – all his 70 years except for a stint in the Navy. Pierce says he was drawn to Trump in 2016 for the same reason he backed Ross Perot in 1992. “I wanted a non-career politician in there that would do, would run it like a company,” Pierce said in an interview in the garage office where he organizes his part-time consulting work. Pierce sees Biden as too unwilling to stand up to the Democratic left and has fond memories of the pre-Covid economy during the Trump administration. “We didn’t have the high inflation,” he said. “We didn’t have the high interest rates.” Pierce is not an election denier. He does believe it was wrong that many states adopted new voting rules during the 2020 pandemic, but said Trump should have honored the results once all his challenges were exhausted. Nor is Pierce a fan of the former president’s toxic tone. “If he’d just shut up and, you know, got off Twitter and that kind of stuff, he’d have made a great president,” Pierce said. He called himself a likely Trump voter in the primary and described the choice between Trump and Haley as “the lesser of two evils.” Billy Pierce talks to John King in Hartsville, South Carolina. CNN But Pierce is very much in line with Trump on policy matters. “He’s going to fix the things I need him to fix,” Pierce said, listing the border as his top priority. “Shut it down,” is Pierce’s desire, though he agrees with Trump that congressional Republicans should not pass a border package before the November election – even if it would slow the flow of illegal border crossings. “This is a Democratic ploy” designed to help Biden, Pierce said. He offers a suggestion on what he would do at the border, based on his time in the military. “Have us put up razor wire,” Pierce said. “I have no problem with putting up two rows and mining the other. So if they come in, you tell them it is mined. You put signs out there that says it’s mined.” He balances such tough talk with a personal story about his daughter adopting two children from Guatemala. Be tough at the border now, Pierce said, and then conversations about more legal immigration would be possible. “It needs to be done the right way.” From sending a message to DC to sending a message to the next generation Craig Thomas lived in Tennessee when Trump caught his attention in 2016. Thomas describes himself as “conservative, some areas libertarian.” Trump, he thought then, was an outsider – and a vote for him would send a message to Washington. “It was like, alright, like this is good,” said Thomas. “Let’s blow some things up.” Now, Thomas lives in Charleston and is voting for Haley – to send a message to his two children. Craig Thomas talks to John King in Charleston, South Carolina. CNN He is tired of all the personal attacks and all the anger and wants a president who is also a role model. Haley, he said, “brings very similar policy positions, but definitely without the drama.” One recent MAGA conspiracy theory hit too close to home. “I don’t think there’s any sort of a crazy conspiracy between the NFL and Taylor Swift and everything else just showing up for a Biden coronation,” Thomas said. “How do I look at my daughter, who is a huge Taylor Swift fan, and this guy just attacking Taylor Swift, just because she is going to support another candidate, right.” “And other things like that. And having those conversations with them. It does matter. And it does matter who you support.” Trump as a religion Charleston is rich with both Revolutionary and Civil War history, a place where you can still ride a horse-drawn carriage down a cobblestone street. It is more affluent, more educated and less Trumpy than most of South Carolina. “But there is quite a bit of talk about Trump, even here,” Thomas said. Mark Sanford is out of politics because of that – because of the reach of the Trump Republican revolution. Sanford served in the House representing a Charleston-area district, and then was the state’s two-term Republican governor just before Haley was first elected in 2010. Sanford won his old House seat back in 2013, but then lost the Republican primary in 2018 because he was a sharp critic of then-President Trump’s fiscal policies, and sometimes of his tone. “I would say, ‘Well I’m for Trump in this area, but I’m against in these different areas.’ But people didn’t want nuance. They want: ‘Are you for or against him.’” Sanford wouldn’t directly answer when asked how he will vote in this month’s primary. But he did offer this: “I’ve never voted for Trump so far. I know that I’m not voting for him this time. I’ll let you read the tea leaves from that.” John King talks to Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman from the Charleston area. CNN Sanford agrees when Haley goes after Trump for all the “chaos,” and especially when she highlights the deficit spending of the Trump years. Yet he expects a big Trump win in South Carolina, because the GOP electorate is so different now from when he was first elected. “What has traditionally worked in GOP politics isn’t so much working these days,” he said in an interview at his home in the Charleston suburb of Mount Pleasant. “He became sort of a proxy litmus test for ‘Are you for or against the system,’” Sanford said. “I’ve seen this erosion,” Sanford said. “Sort of Perot movement to Tea Party to Trump. It’s metastasized in ever aggressive forms. And what started out as a lot of well meaning Americans saying, ‘Look, we’ve got to do something about politicians doing what they said they were going to do’ (has evolved) into something much more strident. … It is their religion. I mean, I, I don’t know how else to explain it.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/fact-check-trump-nato/index.html,"Washington CNN — For a third straight presidential election campaign, former President Donald Trump is being serially inaccurate about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance. Trump caused a transatlantic uproar this weekend by claiming at a Saturday campaign rally that he had once told the president of a “big” NATO country that if that country didn’t pay its “bills,” he would not protect the country from a Russian invasion and would even “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want.” Trump’s incendiary remarks contained a familiar false claim. His assertion about NATO allies supposedly having failed to pay “bills” is not true, as fact-checkers at CNN and elsewhere have pointed out for years. And Trump has for years made a variety of other false claims about spending by NATO and its members. Here is a fact check of five of his repeated statements. Spending by NATO members Trump has long claimed that various NATO members have failed to pay their “ bills ,” “ dues ” or “ NATO fees ,” that they “ owe us a tremendous amount of money ” or that they “ owe NATO billions of dollars .” Facts First: All of these Trump claims are false. While a majority of NATO members do not meet the alliance’s target of each member spending a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, the 2% target is a “guideline ” that does not create bills, debts or legal obligations if it is not met. In fact, the guideline doesn’t require payments to NATO or the US at all. Rather, it simply requires each country to spend on their own defense programs. When Trump was president, the guideline was written in forgiving language that made clear that it was not a firm commitment. That version of the guideline, created at a NATO summit in Wales in 2014, said members that had yet to reach 2% would “aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade with a view to meeting their NATO Capability Targets and filling NATO’s capability shortfalls.” In other words, the members that were below 2% in 2014 didn’t even have to promise to hit the target by 2024 – simply to make an effort to do so by then. NATO does require members to make direct contributions to fund the organization’s own operations. But there is no sign that members have failed to make those contributions, which constitute a tiny fraction of the allies’ defense spending, and Trump has made clear that his talk of debts  is about the 2% guideline. Stephen Saideman , the Paterson Chair in International Affairs at Carleton University in Canada, said in a Monday email that the word “inaccurate really does not cover Trump’s protection racket/country club perception of dues owed to the US.” “The money, as you and everyone else knows, is not sent from member states to the US or NATO (although there is a common fund that pays for the buildings in Brussels and elsewhere but it is not that much money and is not the focus of the 2% discussions). The commitment is for each country to spend enough on their own militaries – 2% of GDP, 20% of defense spending on equipment – so that the alliance as a whole is capable and can credibly deter Russia and do whatever else the alliance agrees to,” Saideman said. As of 2023, 11 of 30 NATO members were meeting the 2% target, NATO estimates show . That was up from three members in 2014. Erwan Lagadec , a research professor at George Washington University’s ﻿Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, noted in a Monday email that NATO members agreed to firmer language related to the 2% target in 2023, formally declaring that “we make an enduring commitment to invest at least 2% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually on defence.” Lagadec said that “arguably for the first time the Allies HAVE made a hard commitment to reaching 2% (indeed, to reaching at least 2%) rather than merely ‘trying to get there if possible.’” He noted, though, that even this stronger declaration “doesn’t provide a deadline” to hit 2%. Regardless, it will not create actual debts to the US or NATO. NATO members’ spending before Trump took office As president, Trump claimed that NATO members’ spending had declined “every single year” until he took office in 2017. He sometimes claimed there had been 15 , 16 or 18 years of declines. Facts First : Trump’s claims that NATO members’ spending had declined every year until he took office are false. Official NATO data show that non-US members’ defense spending increased in each of the two years prior to Trump’s presidency – by 1.6% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016. The increases came after NATO members recommitted to the 2%-of-GDP guideline at the 2014 summit in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region . Non-US members’ defense spending increases in each year of the Trump era were bigger than their increases in 2015 and 2016 – the increases were 5.9% in 2017, 4.3% in 2018, 3.6% in 2019 and 4.6% in 2020 – and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg gave Trump at least partial credit . But Trump is wrong when he claims he reversed a downward trend. “If you look at the year-on-year data, the turning point away from the nadir of European defense spending happened in 2014, pre-Trump, and clearly due to Crimea,” Lagadec said. Saideman said that while it’s possible he is undervaluing Trump’s impact because he generally dislikes Trump, “Putin deserves most of the credit for defense spending increases in Europe.” He said, “Everyone was cutting their defense budgets after the 2008 economic crisis and as countries started pulling out of Afghanistan, and all that changed with the seizure of Crimea.” And he argued that any increases sparked by Trump are likely less about his efforts to cajole allies than about those allies’ concerns about the US no longer keeping its commitments given what has sounded from Trump like “genuine hostility to the alliance and to the allies.” Under President Joe Biden, non-US NATO members increased their defense spending by 2.8% in 2021 and an estimated 2.0% in 2022, then by an estimated 8.3% in 2023. That large 2023 spike was “clearly in reaction to the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine” in 2022, Lagadec said. The US share of NATO spending As president, Trump repeatedly claimed that, before him, the US was “ paying for 100% of NATO ” or “ paying close to 100% .” Facts First : Trump’s claims are false. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members – a large majority, but not “100%” or “close to 100%.” And Trump’s claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover NATO’s organizational expenses and are set based on each country’s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016 . The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 68% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany; Lagadec said the US share was reduced from 22% “to placate Trump” and is a “sweetheart deal” given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance’s total GDP . What previous presidents told NATO members As president, Trump repeatedly claimed that before he pressured NATO members to increase their defense spending, US presidents did not even ask them to do so. He singled out former President Barack Obama in his comments at the rally on Saturday. After referring to NATO members Trump said he pressured himself, he continued: “And then I hear that they like Obama better. They should like Obama better. You know why? Because he didn’t ask for anything.” Facts First : Trump’s claims are false. Both Obama and his predecessor, President George W. Bush , repeatedly pressed other NATO members to spend more on defense, though t heir public language was less confrontational than Trump’s. At a news conference in Belgium in 2014, Obama said , “ If we’ve got collective defense, it means that everybody has got to chip in. And I have had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO – not all, but many. The trend lines have been going down.” In a speech in Germany in 2016, Obama said , “Every NATO member should be contributing its full share – 2% of GDP – towards our common security, something that doesn’t always happen. And I’ll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense.” In a speech to Canada’s Parliament in 2016, he said , “As your ally and as your friend, let me say that we’ll be more secure when every NATO member, including Canada, contributes its full share to our common security.” In a speech in the Czech Republic in 2002, before a NATO summit, Bush said that every NATO member needs to make a military contribution to the alliance, and “f or some allies, this will require higher defense spending.” Bush and top administration officials continued for the rest of his presidency to push for increased spending. While visiting Romania in 2008, Bush said , “Building a strong NATO alliance also requires a strong European defense capacity. So at this summit, I will encourage our European partners to increase their defense investments to support both NATO and EU operations.” The cost of NATO’s headquarters While criticizing NATO both during and after his presidency, Trump has claimed that NATO spent $3 billion on its headquarters building in Belgium. Facts First: Trump’s $3 billion figure is not close to accurate. NATO told CNN in 2020 that the headquarters building was constructed for a sum under the approved budget of 1.178 billion euro, or about $1.27 billion at Monday exchange rates – certainly an expensive facility, but less than half what Trump has claimed."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/politics/fact-check-biden-makes-three-false-claims-about-his-handling-of-classified-information/index.html,"CNN — President Joe Biden gave a press conference Thursday night after the release of a report from special counsel Robert Hur, who announced that Biden would not face charges over his handling of classified information from prior to his presidency. Biden was combative , forcefully rejecting Hur’s claims that he has a poor memory. But the president was also repeatedly inaccurate, making three claims that were clearly contradicted by Hur’s report. Here is a fact check. Where the classified material was stored Biden sought to contrast his handling of classified material with that of former President Donald Trump, who faces felony charges for willfully retaining classified documents . (Hur agreed that there were major distinctions between the two cases .) But while Biden correctly noted that the documents were in a private home that is very different from the Mar-a-Lago social club where Trump lives, Biden embellished his argument with a false claim. Biden said: “All the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.” Facts First: Biden’s claim is not true. The special counsel’s report says that while some of the classified documents were found in cabinet drawers in Biden’s Delaware home, other classified documents, about Afghanistan, were found in an “unsealed” and “badly damaged” box sitting in his garage alongside an assortment of other items the special counsel described as “household detritus.” The report includes a photo of the box. Hur wrote that investigators looked into the possibility that the Afghanistan-related documents found in the box were previously stored in a filing cabinet when Biden lived in a rented home in Virginia before moving out in 2019. Hur called that line of inquiry “inconclusive.” Regardless, Biden’s Thursday claim that “all” of the documents in his home were in locked or lockable filing cabinets is not true of his current home. According to the special counsel, even classified documents Biden was storing elsewhere in his home were insufficiently secure. Hur wrote that Biden notebooks containing classified information from his vice presidency were found by investigators in “unlocked drawers in the office and basement den” of the home. Hur wrote that Biden “should have known” that as a private citizen as of 2017, “he was not permitted to keep handwritten notes about the President’s Daily Brief and other classified information in unlocked drawers in his home.” At a White House briefing on Friday, Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the White House Counsel’s Office, would not directly answer when asked about Biden’s claims about the security of the documents held at his home. “Look, I think the president was trying to address a number of inaccurate allegations in this … report,” Sams told CNN’s MJ Lee. “I don’t have anything … to add on what he said last night.” Asked later whether he was saying the special counsel’s report was inaccurate about the storage of documents, Sams again avoided responding directly. “The report lays out in 400 pages of detail all of the evidence and all of the review that they conducted in looking into this matter,” he said. “The president made sure that all of the classified documents that were found were returned promptly to the government, which is what you’re supposed to do, which is why this is the inevitable conclusion that there is no case here.” When the reporter pressed Sams, saying that wasn’t a response to his question, Sams replied: “I understand what you’re trying to ask.” He did not respond further to the question. The classification level of the documents Biden had in his possession Biden claimed of the documents he possessed: “None of it was high classified. It didn’t have any of that red stuff on it, you know what I mean, around the corners? None of that.” Facts First : Biden’s claim that none of the classified material found in his possession was highly classified is false, according to details provided by the special counsel. Hur reported the discovery of documents in Biden’s possession that had markings identifying them as “Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information,” a very high level of classification – plus handwritten notebooks from Biden’s time as vice president that weren’t marked as classified but that “contain information that remains classified up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information level.” It’s not clear whether any of the marked classified documents found in Biden’s possession had the colored borders seen on some of the marked classified documents found in Trump’s possession , which is what Biden appeared to be referring to when he spoke about “that red stuff…around the corners.” Regardless, Hur explained at length that some of the documents were marked as Top Secretand some with other notations identifying them as highly classified. For example, Hur wrote, the open box in Biden’s garage contained an Afghanistan-related memo from the National Security Adviser to President Barack Obama in 2009 marked “TOP SECRET/SCI” (Sensitive Compartmented Information). Hur wrote that experts in the intelligence community said the document contains “highly sensitive information about the military programs of the United States and a foreign government. The unauthorized disclosure of this information, both today and in 2017 when Mr. Biden was no longer vice president, reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.” Hur wrote that the box in the garage contained another 2009 memo from the National Security Adviser to Obama marked “TOP SECRET WITH TOP SECRET/NOFORN/CODEWORD ATTACHMENTS” with attachments, one of which was marked “TOP SECRET//HUMINT/COMINT//ORCON/NOFORN//FISA.”Hur wrote that experts said “portions of this document contain national defense information about sensitive intelligence sources and methods.” In addition, Hur wrote that notebooks with handwritten notes Biden took during his vice presidency contained information on “U.S. intelligence sources, methods, and capabilities,” “U.S. intelligence activities” and “the activities of foreign intelligence services,” among other things. Hur wrote that when investigators looked into a sampling of 37 excerpts from Biden’s handwritten materials that appeared to be classified, they found that “eight are Top Secret with Sensitive Compartmented Information, seven of which include information concerning human intelligence sources,” while six are Top Secret alone, 21 Secret and two Confidential. “Mr. Biden wrote down obviously sensitive information discussed during intelligence briefings with then President Obama and meetings in the White House Situation Room about matters of national security and military and foreign policy,” Hur wrote. What Hur said Biden said to his ghostwriter Hur said in the report that Biden disclosed classified material from his notebooks to the ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer,  who worked with him on a 2017 memoir called “Promise Me, Dad.” But Biden categorically denied that he had shared classified information with the ghostwriter, saying he can “guarantee” he didn’t. When a reporter responded that the special counsel said he did, Biden responded, “No, they did not say that. He did not say that.” Facts First : Biden’s claim is false. Hur did say that, writing explicitly that “Mr. Biden shared information, including some classified information, from those notebooks with his ghostwriter.” He elaborated that Biden shared classified information with his ghostwriter by reading “nearly verbatim” from his notebooks “on at least three occasions,” including his “notes from meetings in the Situation Room.” Hur did find, however, that Biden “at times” tried to avoid sharing classified information, by stopping at or skipping over certain material from the notebooks. And he wrote that “the evidence does not show that when Mr. Biden shared the specific passages with his ghostwriter, Mr. Biden knew the passages were classified and intended to share classified information.” Hur wrote that in one recorded conversation with the ghostwriter in 2017, at the Virginia home where Biden then lived, Biden read from his notebook about a National Security Council meeting about Iraq in 2015, then told the ghostwriter about a 2009 memo he had written to Obama arguing against the deployment of more troops to Afghanistan – and then said, “I just found all the classified stuff downstairs.” Hur noted that more than five years later, investigators found classified documents about the Afghanistan troop surge in Biden’s Delaware garage. Hur wrote that he has not heard of any allegations that classified material actually appeared in Biden’s 2017 memoir. This story has been updated with additional reaction.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/politics/kfile-whatley-promoted-false-election-fraud-claims/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump and his allies are pushing to replace the chair of the Republican National Committee with North Carolina’s party leader who promoted 2020 presidential election lies and supported using the courts to overturn the results. Michael Whatley, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, shared false claims that Republican observers were prevented from accessing polling locations and repeatedly said Democratic cities in swing states were engaged in “massive fraud,” a CNN KFile review of Whatley’s comments following the election found. Whatley, who has since acknowledged Joe Biden is the country’s legitimate president, currently serves as general counsel at the RNC overseeing litigation and what the organization calls its “election integrity” efforts. His elevation to RNC chair could give Trump a loyalist more willing to devote resources to pursue future voter fraud claims in court should they arise. One reason why Trump soured on Ronna McDaniel, the current chair, was his perception she should have done more to fight for his candidacy in 2020, CNN reported. Like many Republicans, Whatley publicly backed Trump’s voter fraud claims on multiple occasions following the 2020 election. “Regardless of how these lawsuits come out around the country with the presidential race we do know that there was massive fraud that took place,” Whatley said in one late November 2020 interview on local North Carolina radio. “We know that it took place in places like Milwaukee and Detroit and Philadelphia.” There is no evidence of massive fraud in any of those cities or around the country as Republican election officials and Trump-appointed former Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged . Trump and his supporters filed more than 60 cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one. Whatley, a former Senate staffer and one-time lobbyist focused on energy-related issues, said in a statement to CNN he believed pandemic related changes to voting laws weakened safeguards against voter fraud. “There is no question that changes to the 2020 election process which weakened safeguards on absentee and mail-in votes in some states led to distrust by many across the Country. I firmly believe in having proper safeguards in place to ensure that it is easy to vote and hard to cheat.“ Whatley is one of two candidates Trump and his allies are supporting to take over the RNC. The other is Drew McKissick, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. Trump turned on McDaniel over the poor finances and management of the RNC at a time when the organization is facing one of its worst fundraising years in a decade. CNN reported Tuesday that McDaniel is planning to step down at the end of the month. Despite Trump’s preferred picks, only RNC members can choose to elect the new chairman. False claims about the 2020 election In his capacity as chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party in the days following the 2020 election, Whatley parroted much of Trump’s false election claims. One day before the election was called for Biden, Whatley echoed false claims about Republican poll watchers being barred from observation. “There’s also issues [in] surrounding states like Michigan and Pennsylvania where they’re not allowing Republican observers into the polling location to watch the voting,” Whatley said. “When we have instances of voter fraud, then obviously if those are widespread enough to be able to, you know, affect the outcome, you’re gonna have litigation that’s gonna deal with those.” One week following the 2020 election, Whatley called it alarming that the results would be determined in court but said it was the strategy needed for Trump to secure victory. At the time, there were recounts occurring in major swing states – all of which would affirm Biden’s victory. “I think that what we’re seeing in Georgia, especially with the hand recount,” he said on local North Carolina radio . “What we’re seeing in Arizona where we’re gonna have a recount out there as well – And then it’s gonna basically put states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin into court. It really is kind of scary proposition to think that you’re gonna have a court overturn some of those results. But that’s really the plan.” “And I get asked every single day by a reporter, why do you keep alleging that there’s fraud out there?” he continued. “And it’s like, all you have to do is look at the stories that we’re seeing out of Philadelphia, the Detroit area, we’re seeing out of Milwaukee, egregious violations of election law. And there’s no question why it puts these elections at risk.” At the time, Trump and his allies were inundating the public with unfounded allegations of fraud in Democratic cities. They made baseless claims of excluded poll watchers, fake reports of suitcases filled with fraudulent ballots, bogus allegations of bussed-in ballots from New York to swing states and false assertions that Philadelphia had more ballots than voters. Whatley pointed to the contested 2000 presidential election recount in Florida, where he served on the Bush recount team during the legal disputes between George W. Bush and Al Gore, to argue the election was far from over. Ultimately, the Supreme Court intervened and stopped the recount, effectively deciding the election in Bush’s favor. “We’re not done in the presidential. We’re not done at all,” he added, referring to the 2020 election, in the interview. Condemned January 6th - but suggested not done by “Republican voters” In an interview on January 2, 2021, Whatley resigned himself to Biden being President – but said objections to the election were important to discuss the claims of fraud. “I think the fact that we’re likely to have the outcome be that Joe Biden is going to get certified and sworn in, does not mean that these protests are irrelevant,” he said . “It is absolutely critical that we have a national dialogue on election integrity. What we saw in places like Milwaukee and Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Phoenix is really very, very troubling.” Following the riot on January 6, 2021, Whatley condemned those who broke into the Capitol building in interviews. “The actions of these violent protestors is completely unjustified and unacceptable. There is no rationale to excuse this assault on the foundations of our Democracy,” he said in a tweet since deleted. In an interview, Whatley described himself as “appalled” by January 6th riot, but said the Republican Party as “a whole” was not “complicit” in what happened. “Most of the people that have been arrested were not necessarily Republican voters,” Whatley said in February 2021. “There’s certainly Trump supporters in there, but we’ve also seen others and we’re gonna unequivocally condemn those actions. In the aftermath of the January 6th some have sought to deflect blame for the riot by alleging Republican partisans weren’t the primarily force behind it, though subsequent investigations have shown that those arrested were mostly Trump supporters. In another interview in February 2021 , Whatley acknowledged Biden as “legitimately” elected President of the United States. “I was a member of the Electoral College, and I proudly cast my vote for President Trump. But the Electoral college voted. And a majority was for Joe Biden and he is the President of the United.” Following Biden’s inauguration, Whatley attacked the impeachment of former President Trump and in March referred to the Republican Party as “Donald Trump’s party,” at a local event."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/07/politics/supreme-court-trump-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — There is a dizzying array of court cases related to former President Donald Trump. Only one is headed to the US Supreme Court this week. It is a Colorado case in which Trump was declared ineligible for the state’s 2024 ballot for violating the Civil War-era insurrection clause in the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution. When we asked CNN readers for their questions about the Supreme Court case, it quickly became clear in the hundreds of responses that a lot of people are struggling to keep all of Trump’s legal issues separate. For instance, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Thursday in the 14th Amendment case – the same week that an appeals court in Washington, DC, clarified that, no, Trump does not enjoy “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution for his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election. For an excellent, shorter version of what might happen at the court this week, listen to this “One Thing” podcast with CNN’s Supreme Court expert Joan Biskupic . In answering readers’ questions below, we’ve tried to delineate between the multiple cases involving Trump. We’ve also edited the wording in some questions for grammar and style. Can Trump be prevented from being on all election ballots in 2024? Dave in Texas The case Supreme Court justices are hearing on Thursday has to do with a finding in Colorado’s court system that Trump engaged in insurrection and a decision by the state Supreme Court that he should be removed from the ballot. The state courts stayed that decision until the US Supreme Court weighs in. What comes next is very much in the hands of the US Supreme Court, and there are many possible outcomes. Will justices affirm or overturn the decision by Colorado’s Supreme Court? Will the US Supreme Court weigh in on whether Trump engaged in insurrection? If justices allow Trump to be excluded from the Colorado ballot, will it endanger his status in other states? There is no requirement that the same names appear on every presidential ballot in the country, and in fact, the ballots vary from state to state. If you are indicted, are you presumed innocent? If a person has not been found guilty, how can they be barred from an election? Peter in Florida Yes, anyone facing criminal prosecution, including Trump, is presumed innocent. But the question currently before the Supreme Court about whether he violated the insurrectionist clause in the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal charges he faces in state and federal courts. In the 14th Amendment case , which was brought by a group of Republican and independent voters in Colorado, a state judge found, after hearing evidence, that Trump “engaged in insurrection.” The Colorado Supreme Court later ruled, by a slim majority, that he was ineligible to be on the state’s ballot. Now the US Supreme Court gets to weigh in. Of course, Trump is facing four different criminal trials – and two of them, in state court in Georgia and federal court in Washington, DC, have to do with his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But he is not currently charged in any court with the specific crime of inciting insurrection or rebellion. Could the Supreme Court endanger other aspects of the 14th Amendment, such as birthright citizenship, if it interpreted the insurrection clause as only relevant to a specific historical period, like the aftermath of the Civil War, thus potentially excluding its application to modern contexts, such as the protection of freedom of speech and the right to protest? James in New York This is a thoughtful question. Trump, for instance, has said that if he is reelected he will work to end birthright citizenship, even though it is guaranteed in the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment also has important clauses having to do with the drawing of congressional districts – a subject on which the Supreme Court frequently gets involved – and the public debt, which has grown exponentially. It is possible that the people who try to influence US policy by maneuvering cases toward the Supreme Court could try to exploit a decision for their own purposes. But it would be the height of irony for conservative justices who claim to be “originalist” interpreters of the Constitution, particularly in terms of the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms, to stray from originalism in the case of the 14th Amendment. Can Trump actually be convicted of a felony and still be elected as our president? One cannot be in the military if convicted of a felony, so how could this be possible? Robin in New York We get this question a lot. The answer is yes. There is nothing in the Constitution about a convict being unqualified to serve. There are only three requirements. A candidate must be: A natural born citizen. At least 35 years old. A resident of the US for at least 14 years. It is an important thing for voters to be able to choose from the candidates they desire and for the system to protect against frivolous criminal prosecutions aimed at disqualifying political opponents. The efforts to try Trump in criminal court, which have dragged on for years, have been anything but frivolous. But again, the Supreme Court this week is not considering anything to do with Trump’s criminal prosecutions. This case is specifically focused on the finding that he engaged in insurrection and his ability to appear on the ballot in Colorado. Do you really believe the Supreme Court will rule against Trump? Really you should remember who appointed them. They have lost my trust in the judicial system. Gerald It is true that Trump appointed three of the nine Supreme Court’s associate justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. It is also true that this Supreme Court did not intervene to help him keep the White House in 2020. Without any public dissents, they rejected his bid to block millions of votes for Joe Biden in battleground states. What are the chances that Trump is banned from the ballot and jailed for his part in the insurrection? Becky in Ohio These are separate questions. Trump’s ballot eligibility in Colorado is before the nine Supreme Court justices. While he has not been charged in criminal court specifically with the crime of insurrection, he does face four separate criminal trials, two of which are focused on his 2020 election interference. In those cases, which will be decided by juries of Trump’s peers, he could theoretically face jail time if convicted. What recourse does the American citizen have when SCOTUS rules against the meaning of law? Or, cowardly punts the decision to the states or Congress? Rebecca Vote. Supreme Court justices are appointed by presidents and confirmed by senators. If you don’t like the makeup of the court, the only current way to change it is to vote for lawmakers you agree with and then wait for them to act. That’s an unsatisfying answer since justices can sit on the bench for decades. There are efforts to change the court to spark more frequent turnover, but they currently lack momentum. To the second part of this question, the court can essentially make law with its decisions, so they are reinterpreting rather than ruling against it. To that point, if, as a voter, you’d rather have more input on laws, it is a feature and not a flaw when the court punts decisions back to lawmakers. Trump lawyers say because the 14th Amendment doesn’t specifically say ‘president’ that it doesn’t pertain to Trump. It does say that anyone holding office that has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution cannot hold office if they participate in insurrection. The presidency is the highest office in the USA. This has to make him accountable. Am l correct? Eldon This is the question on which the entire 14th Amendment case may hinge. The original Colorado judge who ruled Trump did engage in insurrection did not remove Trump from the ballot. She was convinced by his lawyers’ argument that the presidency is not covered by the insurrection clause because it does not specifically list the president as an “officer” of the US. The Colorado Supreme Court took the opposite view. Read its opinion , which examines, in great detail, all of the arguments about whether the president is an officer of the US government and concludes that obviously he or she is. It’s not exactly pertinent to this case, but an appeals court that determined Trump is not immune from prosecution notably referred to the president as an “officer.” Here’s exactly what the 14th Amendment says : No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. If those who make policy and laws are voted into office – such as members of Congress – why don’t Supreme Court justices have to get elected? Their jobs are far more important in the grand scheme since they can just rule a law the other party (and people) voted for as unconstitutional. Matthew in Washington It’s a wonky system. Supreme Court justices are supposed to be insulated from politics and independent from the two elected branches of government. This independence, according to Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, was important to guard the Constitution and individual rights from “ ill humors ” of the public. In reality, most Supreme Court justices come from very political backgrounds, and they are appointed by presidents who hope they will sway to a political side. Their power is supposed to be balanced by the other two branches; they are appointed by the executive, and the legislative branch sets the makeup of the courts and can, if needed, remove judges from office. If the Supreme Court decides to weigh in on the presidential immunity issue, and he wins the election before they make their decision, what could happen? Cheryl-Anne This is a separate question than the 14th Amendment ballot issue the Supreme Court is considering this week. The court specifically declined to take up the question of Trump’s immunity from criminal prosecution so that an appeals court in Washington, DC, could hear that case. That three-judge appeals court panel decided this week that Trump is not immune from prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election. The Supreme Court could now decide to also consider the immunity question, but it’s not at all clear that it will. It’s also not clear what might happen if Trump is convicted and then elected. He could try to pardon himself, despite the obvious moral hazard of doing so. If he’s elected before a conviction, he could try to get the Department of Justice to drop the case. It would be unprecedented territory. Should Clarence Thomas recuse himself in the Trump case because of his wife’s actions? Linda in Virginia For reference, Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a conservative activist and was involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. She has testified she did not discuss the election with her husband. Whether or not her activism means Clarence Thomas should recuse himself from election-related cases is up for debate. There are no hard rules related to Supreme Court justices recusing themselves from cases. What is abundantly clear is that Clarence Thomas probably won’t be recusing himself from Trump-related matters. Why has no one stated that judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, should be removed from overseeing a court involving Trump? She has made judgments in favor of Trump’s defense on motions that the prosecution has not even filed for the court to review. Judge Cannon is violating her oath to be unbiased and impartial while acting as a sitting judge. Keith This question pertains to one of the four criminal cases – the one being prosecuted in federal court in Florida and in which the government says Trump mishandled classified data and conspired to cover it up. It is true that Cannon was appointed by Trump, but so was one-third of the US Supreme Court. Judges appointed by both Barack Obama and Biden have also heard matters related to Trump and election interference. That’s the way the judicial system works. If the timing is such that Trump gets elected and then is later convicted of federal crimes, what happens? Can Congress take impeachment action on that? What is involved? Or is he untouchable as chief exec? Worse, can he be actual president while in prison? Can he be placed in prison by a court after being elected president? Biff The general thinking is that Trump would find a way to throw out federal prosecutions if they are not concluded before he takes office, assuming he is reelected. The Department of Justice has a long-standing custom of not taking legal action against a sitting president. But that policy does not apply to state courts, and he is facing two criminal prosecutions in state courts in Georgia and New York. Congress could always move to impeach him, but that would only be a realistic possibility if Democrats took control of the House. I’m trying to imagine an election in which Trump won the White House and Democrats won the House. It’s not impossible! But maybe unlikely. Plus, any majority on Capitol Hill is likely to be small, and multiple Republican votes would be required to convict him in the Senate, which at the moment also seems unlikely. We would be deep into uncharted territory if Trump was to be convicted and then win reelection. Nobody really knows what would be involved. If the US Supreme Court decides he can be excluded from ballots, could enough people ‘write his name in?’ How will those votes actually be counted in districts, and more importantly, will those votes actually supersede the fact that he isn’t actually on the ballot and count? Grady in North Carolina Trump’s name is already printed on primary ballots in Colorado. If the Supreme Court rules he can be kept off the ballot before the primary on March 5, the state Secretary of State has said that votes for him would not count. As for write-ins, the case is ultimately about his eligibility to serve as president. If the court rules he’s ineligible, write-ins probably would not matter. But that would have to be determined. Why isn’t Trump’s trial being televised? Or the upcoming Supreme Court hearing? The people need to see what is really happening – the good and the bad. Ilda in Texas Federal courts do not allow television cameras, which I’ve argued is a mistake . That said, there will be live audio of the Supreme Court oral arguments Thursday. That’s a step in the right direction. Is there the possibility the Supreme Court narrowly decides that states cannot dictate who a party chooses as its candidate based on freedom of speech and assembly and not make a decision on whether a state can remove a candidate from the general election ballot? Jeffrey Anything is possible for the Supreme Court. Justices frequently find creative ways to decide the outcome of cases without deciding core issues in them. See Bush v. Gore, which decided the 2000 presidential election by stopping a recount in Florida. The scenario you describe would, I believe, allow Trump to be on the ballot while sidestepping the issue of whether he engaged in insurrection. That would not be shocking. If Trump is unable to run for president for ANY reason, who will the Republicans back as their candidate? Bill in Virginia We don’t know for sure, but timing is everything. Primaries season is underway and Trump is the clear choice of most Republicans so far (as is Biden on the Democratic side). If Trump or Biden were to leave the race early enough, perhaps an alternate would be able to win enough delegates to capture the nomination. Given her break with Trump, it seems unlikely that most Republicans would want to choose former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. If there’s no candidate who has won a majority of the delegates after the primaries, the delegates themselves would ultimately pick alternative candidates at the party conventions this summer. That would be a fascinating and messy process to witness. If a vacancy occurred after the nominating conventions, both parties have processes to pick alternates. If, as he claims, Trump won the 2020 election, why doesn’t the 22nd Amendment keep him from running now? James in North Carolina I think you’ve identified a main problem with his continued lies about the 2020 election. The 22nd Amendment makes clear that a person can only be elected twice to the presidency. Despite what he says, however, he was not elected in 2020 and he’s not president now, so the 22nd Amendment should not apply to him."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/haley-voters-trump-gop-biden-analysis/index.html,"CNN — As the South Carolina Republican primary approaches, the evidence is growing that Nikki Haley’s coalition is almost certainly not large enough to deny Donald Trump the GOP presidential nomination. But evidence is also accumulating that her coalition is more than large enough to deny Trump the White House in a general election if her voters remain as alienated from him as they now say they are. Story highlights Haley is exposing fault lines in the GOP coalition Her coalition doesn't appear to be enough to stop Trump from winning the nomination But her supporters present an opportunity for Biden to peel off crossover voters in a possible rematch with Trump The support for Haley in the early GOP contests has mapped, probably more precisely than ever before, the segments of the Republican electorate most deeply disaffected with Trump. In a possible rematch with Trump this fall, President Joe Biden will likely need to attract crossover support from a significant share of those ordinarily Republican-leaning voters to overcome the towering discontent evident in polls about his own performance. So far, most polls show Biden making only very limited inroads in a general election against Trump with the kind of GOP primary voters displaying the most support for Haley – a universe centered on college-educated, ideologically centrist, and Republican-leaning independent voters. But surveys of voters participating in the Iowa and New Hampshire nominating contests show that most Haley supporters express deeply negative views about Trump. That could provide Biden an opening for greater gains in the months ahead – if he can resolve, or even temper, more of those voters’ doubts about his own record, age and strength. “If there’s anything that should be sending warning flares up in the sky for the Trump people, this is it,” said Ace Smith, a California-based Democratic strategist, referring to the large number of Haley voters expressing negative views of the former president in polls. Long-time GOP strategist Michael Madrid, who advised the anti-Trump Lincoln Project in 2020, said the evidence of the early Republican results, and polls of GOP voters nationwide about the Trump-Haley contest, are sending the party a clear, but dual, message. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, in December 2023. Carlos Barria/Reuters/File Related article CNN Poll: Most Americans want verdict on Trump election subversion charges before 2024 vote On the one hand, Madrid said, all of these signals show “there’s not a lane for anyone else to get the nomination: This is Trump’s party.” But the same evidence, Madrid said, shows “Trump is entering this race significantly weaker with the Republican base than at any time since he secured the nomination in 2016.” The first stages of the battle for the 2024 GOP nomination have largely confirmed the party’s divided attitudes about Trump, which have been seen in national surveys over the past several years. Depending on the question, somewhere between one-fifth and one-third of self-identified GOP partisans have consistently expressed negative views in polls about Trump, particularly regarding his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection and his broader effort to overturn the 2020 election result. For instance, in a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland national survey , between 19% to 23% of Republicans and independents who lean toward the party agreed that Trump bore significant responsibility for the January 6 riot; that Trump “threatened democracy” when he told his supporters to march on the Capitol that day; that he was likely guilty of the criminal charges against him for attempting to overturn the 2020 election; and that the January 6 assault “was an attack on democracy that should never be forgotten.” Likewise, in a recent CBS poll released on the third anniversary of January 6 , about one-fourth of Republicans said they would describe the attack on the Capitol as an insurrection and an attempt to overthrow the US government. Roughly 3-in-10 Republicans said Biden had legitimately won the 2020 election and about one-third opposed pardons for the January 6 rioters, which Trump has signaled he will offer if elected to another term. More broadly, in the latest CNN national poll conducted by SSRS , just under one-fourth of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents said they viewed Trump unfavorably. Almost exactly the same share said the party would have a better chance to win in November with a nominee other than Trump . In a national NBC News poll released Sunday , 22% of GOP primary voters agreed that “the Republican Party needs a new leader with better personal behavior and a different approach” than Trump, while another 14% said “Donald Trump was a good president, but it is time to consider other leaders.” Across all of these questions, the share of Republican-leaning voters expressing negative views about Trump does not nearly approach a majority of the party. That explains why Haley faces such a steep uphill climb against him for the nomination, even though she has finally achieved the one-on-one race against Trump that his Republican critics have sought since 2016. Yet through Iowa and New Hampshire, despite not winning those contests, the former South Carolina governor has demonstrated that the minority of the party that has long expressed anti-Trump views in polls can be mobilized into a coherent coalition of resistance to him at the ballot box. And at a time when the nation is divided so closely between Republicans and Democrats, defection from even such a minority faction in his own camp could be difficult for Trump to overcome in a general election should he advance that far.

In Iowa, the voters resisting Trump split between Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has since dropped out; in New Hampshire they consolidated around Haley as the sole remaining alternative. But in each case, the GOP voters rejecting Trump have displayed similar demographic and ideological characteristics, according to the entrance and exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. In each state, Trump showed significantly less strength among voters with a college degree than those without one and much less strength among independents who voted than partisan Republicans. He also lagged among voters who identify as somewhat conservative or moderate compared to those who called themselves “very conservative” and did not run as well among those who do not identify as evangelical Christians as those who do. “This is not a casual vote, it’s a really thought-out vote,” said Celinda Lake, a long-time Democratic pollster who advised Biden’s 2020 campaign. “It has a whole schema around it – views about policy, views about temperament, about the criminal cases. It’s a very integrated view [about Trump].” In the two kick-off contests, Haley voters in particular expressed strikingly negative views about Trump and his assertions about the 2020 election. In the entrance poll conducted of GOP caucusgoers in Iowa, almost exactly 4-in-5 Haley voters said Trump would not be fit to serve as president again if convicted of a crime, according to results provided by CNN’s polling unit; likewise 4-in-5 Haley Iowa voters said Biden had legitimately won the 2020 election. In New Hampshire, more than 4-in-5 Haley voters said Trump would not be fit to serve again if convicted and that Biden had legitimately won. Fully 85% of Haley supporters said they would be dissatisfied if Trump were the nominee. The AP/NORC VoteCast poll offered similar warning signs for Trump. In that poll, two-thirds of Haley voters in Iowa said they would not vote for Trump in a general election; that number soared past three-fourths of her voters in New Hampshire. The Washington Post/Monmouth University poll of GOP voters in South Carolina released last week showed Trump opening a resounding 26 percentage point lead over Haley in her home state, which will hold its critical GOP primary on February 24. Yet the survey also raised the same general election red flags for Trump as the Edison surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Morry Gash/Pool/Getty Images/File Related article A Biden-Trump rematch would be mostly about Trump In the South Carolina poll, roughly three-fourths of those voting for Haley said they viewed Trump unfavorably; over three-fourths said Biden legitimately won in 2020; nearly three-fifths said Trump committed a crime in his response to that result; and less than one-in-five said they planned to vote for Trump in November. Smith said that the resistance to Trump surfacing in these early GOP primary polls will be “a huge, huge problem” for him in the general election. Two factors largely explain it, he believes: hostility to Trump’s role in overturning the nationwide legal right to abortion, which the US Supreme Court did in 2022, “plus people just not wanting the craziness and the chaos.” Madrid said the cumulative evidence from the early election results and these surveys indicates that the component of the GOP coalition dubious of Trump is larger than most people have thought – and likely larger than at any point since he first emerged as the party’s nominee in 2016. The Republicans critical of Trump were so isolated that “we used to be on one group chat and now we are running out of muskets to hand out to be in the conflict,” Madrid said. “I think everybody you talk to will all say the same thing: something has shifted. [Haley] is becoming the rallying cry for something different and something bigger, and that tells me that the swamp fever has broken with a wide part of the Republican Party.” Madrid estimates that the share of ordinarily Republican-leaning voters fundamentally disaffected with Trump has grown from around 6%-8% in 2020 to as much as nearly 20% now. Still, experts in both parties agree that many of the Haley primary voters now saying they would not support Trump in November would eventually fall into line behind him if he becomes the nominee. Haley herself, of course, has said that if she loses the nomination she would vote for Trump over Biden “any day of the week.” Jennifer Horn, a former New Hampshire Republican party chair who has become a fierce Trump critic, said, “I don’t think that whole 30%” or so of GOP voters coalescing behind Haley in the early states “goes to Biden because amongst that 30% are folks that are very loyal Republicans. They might not be loyal MAGA … but we know there are people out there who simply won’t vote for a Democrat.” The key “question for Biden,” she added, “is how many of the others can he win over?” Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump’s 2024 campaign, said that Trump would suffer minimal defections in the GOP coalition in a rematch with Biden because Republican voters believe Trump’s presidency produced far better results on the issues they care about than the current administration. “As long as they think Joe Biden is a really bad president, [Trump] will still keep those” voters now flocking to Haley, McLaughlin said. “They will be voting their self-interest. They are voting their pocketbooks, the border, crime and safety. They are voting war and peace. We always say the presidential race is decided by the two p’s: peace and prosperity. And on those ‘two p’s’ they look at Donald Trump and say, he did a better job.” The CNN national poll released last week suggests that many of the Republicans skeptical of Trump are indeed making that calculation. In a hypothetical matchup against the former president, the survey found Biden winning just 6% of GOP partisans and independents who leaned toward the party – far fewer than the 23% of those voters who expressed an unfavorable view of Trump. One key reason: fully 93% of all GOP-leaning voters said they disapproved of Biden’s performance as president. Similarly, in the new national NBC poll, just 8% of all GOP primary voters said they plan to vote for Biden in the general election – far fewer than the more than one-third in the survey who said they wanted the party to move beyond Trump. “I just don’t think there’s some significant possibility of [the] people telling AP VoteCast or the Exit Poll they are Republican not voting for Trump,” despite what they say now, veteran GOP pollster Bill McInturff – whose firm conducts the NBC survey with a Democratic partner – said in an email. Lake agrees the Republican disaffection surfacing in the primaries is so far translating more into hesitance about Trump than support for Biden. But she sees opportunities for Biden to flip more of those conflicted voters in the months ahead. Trump’s vehement personal attacks on Haley – as well as his vituperative comments about E. Jean Carroll and his supporters’ fervid denunciations of Taylor Swift ­– will alienate more GOP-leaning women, Lake believes. And the fact that so many independents have made the effort to participate in a Republican primary to vote against Trump, she said, shows they remain within reach for Biden, even if they are down on his performance now. In addition, Lake noted, the Haley coalition revolves heavily around college-educated voters who are the most likely to express growing optimism about the economy, particularly with the stock market surging. Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster who advised the super PAC supporting DeSantis during his presidential run, takes a position somewhere in between McInturff and Lake. Wilson believes many of the voters flocking to Haley are lost to a Trump-led GOP, but that Trump can win a general election without them. He can offset any defections, Wilson wrote in an email, “by winning votes from groups that would have voted for Democrats prior to the last few elections.” “We can see in some of the recent national polls what his 2024 path to victory might look like,” Wilson added, “and it’s through the White and Hispanic working class rather than by winning over all the Haley voters.” Madrid counters that the primary results so far show Trump faces the risk that his losses among upscale voters compared to 2020 will exceed his gains in blue-collar and non-White communities. Madrid believes Biden’s record on immigration is the biggest obstacle to him harvesting support among the Republicans uneasy about Trump. Discontent over illegal immigration, Madrid argues, is the most powerful weapon Trump will have in a general election to win back Republican-leaning women who both dislike his behavior and support abortion rights. For Biden, who has endorsed a tough bipartisan Senate immigration bill, “the best way he can guarantee his reelection is to crash hard into the center on that issue, and go hard on the border,” Madrid said. Lake doesn’t agree that any single issue is critical for Biden with the kind of GOP voters who have rallied to Haley. Instead, she believes the GOP primaries are again showing that Trump’s biggest weakness are doubts about his character, demeanor and priorities. “We know that they [the Republicans resistant to Trump] are worried about how strong and effective Biden can be,” Lake said. “But the reality is their vote is going to be about Trump; it’s not going to be about Biden. Biden has to be the mirror to show you what Trump really is. Where Trump is chaos, he is steady. Where Trump is about revenge, he is about solutions.” The widespread dissatisfaction with Biden’s performance has generated ominous splits in the Democratic coalition, particularly among younger voters and minority men. Finding ways to exploit the divisions in the GOP coalition that Haley has exposed may be Biden’s best hope of overcoming the cracks in his own electoral foundation."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/family-palestinian-american-detained-israeli-forces-alleges-mistreatment/index.html,"CNN — The family of Samaher Esmail, a Palestinian-American detained in the West Bank by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), alleged on Tuesday that she has been beaten and denied medication while in Israeli custody, according to a statement released on their behalf. The family also said that US officials have not been granted consular access to her more than a week after her detention. The family said that Esmail, 46, was “dragged” from her home by IDF members and “beaten badly in Israeli custody.” They also said her home was destroyed in the raid. “Despite having had her prescription medication from the moment they arrested her, the IDF has declined to administer it,” the family statement said. “Despite having a clear obligation to grant Consular access, the Netanyahu government has declined daily requests from the U.S. Embassy for permission to visit Ms. Esmail.” The IDF confirmed Esmail’s detention, saying she was “arrested for incitement on social media,” but did not respond to the allegations of mistreatment raised by the family. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said he could not speak to the specific claims made by the family, citing privacy laws. “In any of these circumstances, whether it be in Israel or elsewhere, we seek consular access, we seek access to the individual and we talk to their family when appropriate,” he said at a department press briefing Tuesday. “We try to ensure that detainees or people who are arrested are treated fairly, are treated humanely, have full access to due process, have access to counsel,” he continued. “As is often the case, due to privacy considerations that are just in the law that don’t give me any wiggle room at all, I’m unable to speak in detail about this,” Miller said, but noted that his lack of ability to speak about the case should not be misinterpreted “as a lack of activity by the United States.” In a statement to CNN Tuesday, the IDF said Esmail was arrested during “a battalion operation that took place in the area of the village of Silwad to arrest terror suspects” on February 5. “All those arrested in the operation were transferred to the security forces for further treatment,” the IDF said. The IDF did not address the family’s claims about Esmail’s mistreatment in custody and referred further questions to the Israel Prison Service, to whom CNN has reached out. The IDF response also did not provide further details about the alleged “incitement on social media.” According to the family, Esmail was detained because of “10-year-old Facebook posts and political cartoons she shared.” Posts from Esmail’s Facebook seen by CNN show cartoons favorably depicting Hamas and two photos of her holding a gun. Family spokesperson Jonathan Franks said the gun is in Louisiana, where Esmail also resides and legally owns the firearm. “Ms. Esmail’s opinions may be disfavored in Israel proper, but the inescapable reality is they were protected speech which no rational person could consider an incitement to violence,” the statement released by Franks on behalf of the family said. The statement said she has not been formally charged with a crime. According to the statement, Esmail was presented to a military commission on Monday and was granted bail, but the IDF appealed the ruling. “Ms. Esmail’s ‘arrest’ is just more evidence that the Israeli government of the day is out of control. The fact that the U.S. Embassy has been denied access to Ms. Esmail for eight days is outrageous, and one wonders if the Israeli government doesn’t want a U.S. consular officer to see the bruises that Ms. Esmail’s (Israeli) lawyer says cover her body,” the family said. They called on the US to do more to obtain consular access to Esmail. “The United States is not without tools to obtain consular access to Ms. Esmail and to end her ordeal. It just has to find the moral courage to do so, which has been, thus far, a tall order,” the statement said. Esmail is not the only American to have been detained in the Palestinian territories recent days. Two other Americans, Hashem Alagha, 20, and Borak Alagha, 18, were detained by Israeli forces during a raid of a home in Gaza last week, according to a family member in the United States. Miller was also unable to give updates on their case, citing privacy laws. In addition to the detentions, two Palestinian-Americans have been killed in less than a month in the West Bank. 17-year-old Mohammad Ahmed Mohammad Khdour was shot in the head by Israeli forces on Saturday while traveling by car in the town of Biddu, according to the organization “Defense for Children – Palestine.” Last month, another American, 17-year-old Tawfic Abdel, was fatally shot in the head, according to Palestinian news agency WAFA. On that case, Miller noted that there is an ongoing investigation into the death, and if “that investigation finds that there should be accountability, we expect there to be accountability.” “We are still at the information-gathering process with this second case, but as is always the case, if the information leads us to believe there should be further investigation or accountability measures, we’ll, of course, call for those for those both publicly and privately,” he said.

The foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine, among other priorities.

Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article How each member of the Senate voted on foreign aid package The bill passed the Senate despite Johnson’s criticism of the legislation and former President Donald Trump signaling opposition to the bill by arguing the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is in the form of a loan. The Senate vote was 70 to 29 with 22 Republicans voting in favor, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “History settles every account,” McConnell said in a statement following the vote. “And today, on the value of American leadership and strength, history will record that the Senate did not blink.” The bill includes $60 billion to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia, $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel, $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance and $4.8 billion to support regional partners in the Indo-Pacific region in addition to other policy provisions, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Johnson told reporters on Tuesday that he is not planning to put the package on the House floor, setting up a major clash between the two chambers. “I certainly don’t,” Johnson said when asked if he plans to put the bill on the floor. “Right now, we’re dealing with the appropriations process, we have immediate deadlines upon us and that’s where the attention is in the House in this moment.” President Joe Biden called on House Republicans to hold a vote on the bill in remarks from the White House, saying that a “minority of the most extreme voices in the House,” should not be permitted to block the bill. The president issued a stark warning, cautioning that if lawmakers fail to act, Russian President Vladimir Putin, “won’t limit himself just to Ukraine, and the costs for America and our allies and partners are going to rise.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Schumer, McConnell and “every US Senator who has supported continued assistance to Ukraine as we fight for freedom, democracy, and the values we all hold dear” in a statement Tuesday. “For us in Ukraine, continued US assistance helps to save human lives from Russian terror. It means that life will continue in our cities and will triumph over war,” Zelensky said on X. “American assistance brings just peace in Ukraine closer and restores global stability, resulting in increased security and prosperity for all Americans and all the free world.” Bill faces Johnson’s opposition in the House The Senate passed the legislation after Republicans blocked a broader bill last week that would have combined foreign aid with a bipartisan border deal. Republicans had initially demanded that border security be part of the bill, but went on to reject the bipartisan border deal amid forceful attacks on the measure by Trump and top House Republicans. In a statement on Monday, Johnson criticized the foreign aid bill over its lack of border provisions, saying, the Senate “should have gone back to the drawing board to amend the current bill to include real border security provisions that would actually help end the ongoing catastrophe.” Johnson had previously opposed the broader bill that did include border provisions. The speaker has characterized those provisions as insufficient, despite the fact that they were the product of bipartisan negotiations and included restrictive border measures. “The House will have to figure out a path forward and they’ll have to do it their way, but we needed to start the process and we’ve done that,” Senate GOP Whip John Thune told reporters on Tuesday. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries vowed to use “every available legislative tool to get comprehensive national security legislation over the finish line” in a letter to colleagues. Democrats are limited in their options, however, if Johnson does not bring the bill to the floor. Democrats would need to get the support of a majority of the House — or 218 members when every seat is filled — to sign on to an effort to circumvent GOP leadership and force a floor vote. That effort, known on Capitol Hill as a discharge petition, rarely succeeds and would be difficult to pull off. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer celebrated passage of the legislation, saying in remarks on the floor, “It’s been years, perhaps decades, since the Senate passed a bill that so greatly impacts not just our national security, not just the security of our allies, but the security of western democracy.” “I believe that if Speaker Johnson brought this bill to the House floor, it will pass with the same strong bipartisan support,” Schumer said. Trump’s stance on foreign aid looms The Senate continued to move forward on the bill even as Trump argued the US should not grant foreign aid unless it is a loan, signaling opposition to the legislation. Trump has also indicated he would encourage Russian aggression against any NATO member country that doesn’t pay enough. A number of Senate Republicans either defended or downplayed Trump’s NATO comments on Monday. “I’m 100% behind him,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville said of Trump saying NATO members should be paying their dues or risk Putin invading their country. The Alabama Republican also suggested European allies should be “very worried” about an invasion, saying they should protect themselves and not rely on the US, adding the country “can’t protect everybody.” Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said European allies who are worried about Trump’s comments need to “get over it.” “You know, they need to get over it. They need to stand up and be tough. We need to secure our own border first. We need to take care of things here at home first. When we secure our own border, when we take care of home, great. Let’s help other people as well,” the Republican from Kansas said. In the Senate, consideration of the bill crawled along for days as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky vowed to drag out the timeline in protest over the legislation. Paul continued to dig in on Sunday, saying that he will hold out until “hell freezes over.” He indicated he is ready to hold the floor by speaking on the issue of national debt and other matters. “I love to talk. That’s one of my favorite things to do,” he said. “We do this for a purpose,” Paul said. “I don’t like being here. … I’m not here because it’s fun, I’m here because I don’t think enough people are talking about the danger of the debt.” This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/paul-whelan-blinken-phone-call/index.html,"CNN — US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Monday with Paul Whelan , an American who has been detained in Russia for more than five years, the top US diplomat said Tuesday. “Our intensive efforts to bring Paul home continue every single day. And they will until he and Evan Gershkovich and every other American wrongfully detained is back with their loved ones,” Blinken said at an event on hostage diplomacy at the Wilson Center. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Tuesday that Blinken “assured Paul Whelan, as he has in his previous calls, that we’re with you. We have not forgotten you. We continue to work to try to secure your release and we will continue to work to try to secure your release.” “Your release is a top priority, not just for the secretary, but for President Biden as well,” Miller said. This is at least the third time the top US diplomat has spoken by phone with the ex-Marine, who has been declared wrongfully detained by the US State Department. The two also spoke in August 2023 and December 2022. Whelan told CNN that in the August call, he told Blinken “point blank that leaving me here the first time painted a target on my back and leaving me here the second time basically signed a death warrant.” Whelan has consistently urged the Biden administration to do its utmost to secure his release, expressing frustration at being left behind in two prior prisoner swaps with Russia. The US has said Russian officials refused to negotiate for his release in those swaps. On the fifth anniversary of his detention, Whelan called on President Joe Biden to “please use every resource available to secure my release as you would do if your own son had been taken hostage.” “I’m more than past ready to return home and I’m counting on the US government to come for me and soon. The time is now to take decisive action and bring this debacle to a close,” Whelan told CNN from his prison camp in Mordovia. In the more than half a dozen phone conversations Whelan has had with CNN, he has expressed both confidence that the US government is working to secure his release and immense frustration that those efforts have not yielded success. Miller reiterated on Monday that the US has “put a significant offer on the table” to try to secure Whelan and Gershkovich’s release. “In fact, more than once we have put offers on the table to secure their release, and we will continue to engage to try to pursue, or try to obtain their release,” he said at a press briefing."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/biden-trump-nato-comments/index.html,"Washington CNN — President Joe Biden on Tuesday slammed Donald Trump after the former president said he would encourage Russia to invade countries that don’t meet their NATO obligations, saying such comments amount to bowing down to Vladimir Putin. The remarks – Biden’s latest criticism of Trump from the White House – are some of his harshest criticism of his likely rival on foreign policy to date. Speaking Saturday at a rally in South Carolina, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense. Biden said those comments sent a “dangerous and shocking” signal. “Can you imagine a former president of the United States saying that?” Biden asked incredulously from the State Dining Room. “The whole world heard it. The worst thing is he means it.” Biden began his speech by encouraging the House of Representatives to “immediately” hold a vote on the Senate-passed, $95 billion supplemental aid package that would provide assistance to Ukraine, Israel and US partners in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. More than $60 billion from the Senate package would have been allocated to Ukraine, as the country prepares to mark the second anniversary of its full-scale invasion by Russia. Previous attempts to pass an aid package – combined with a border security bill – were scuttled after Trump came out in opposition. Trump’s comment drew immediate consternation, not only from the American foreign policy establishment but from NATO allies, who have watched warily as Russia proceeds with its invasion of Ukraine. For Biden, who has spent much of his career working on issues related to transatlantic security, the remark was particularly galling. When he heard about the remarks afterward, the president was aghast, according to a person familiar with the matter. He later issued a statement through his campaign decrying the sentiment. The White House criticized Trump’s comments shortly after they were made. “Encouraging invasions of our closest allies by murderous regimes is appalling and unhinged – and it endangers American national security, global stability, and our economy at home,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement on Saturday. Former President Donald Trump arrives on stage during a Get Out The Vote rally at Coastal Carolina University on February 10 in Conway, South Carolina. Win McNamee/Getty Images But Biden’s criticism of Trump from the White House went a step further. In a speech that mentioned Trump by name at least a half-dozen times, Biden sought to forcefully rebut questions about American commitment to its allies. “No other president in our history has bowed down to a Russian dictator,” Biden went on. “Let me say this as clearly as I can: I never will. For God’s sake, it’s dumb. It’s shameful. It’s dangerous. It’s un-American.” On Tuesday, Biden spent a significant portion of his speech on Ukraine aid going after Trump for the remark, which he said undercut longstanding US values. “When America gives its word, it means something. When we make a commitment, we keep it and NATO is a sacred commitment,” Biden said. “Donald Trump looks at this as if it’s a burden,” he added. He said Trump viewed the defense alliance as a “protection racket” and didn’t understand its role in protecting freedom and security. “For Trump, principles never matter. Everything is transactional,” Biden said. He said American adversaries “all cheered” when they heard Trump’s comments. “I will not walk away. I can’t imagine any other president walking away,” Biden said."

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/nikki-haley-joe-biden-resign/index.html,"CNN — Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Tuesday said she thinks President Joe Biden should resign, as it would be in “the best interest of the country.” Asked by radio host Hugh Hewitt during an interview if she believes the president should step down, Haley responded: “Yes, I do.” “I think the Democrat Party knows that and I think that it is not just in the best interest of their party. It’s in the best interest of the country. What I will tell you – and I have said this from the very beginning – the party that gets rid of their 80-year-old candidate is the party that will win,” Haley said. “We cannot have a country in disarray and a world on fire and have two presidential candidates in their 80s when we need someone who’s going to put eight years into making sure that we are disciplined, focused on getting our economy, the border, preventing war, and getting our country back on track,” she added. Haley has made similar calls for years – she cited Biden’s foreign policy as a reason he should step aside in early 2022, and last month, after it was revealed that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did not disclose a hospitalization, she said Biden should be “fired” over the controversy. But Tuesday’s remark is especially pointed as Haley is trying to gain traction ahead of a crucial GOP primary in her home state of South Carolina and as questions over Biden’s fitness for office have been renewed in the wake of special counsel Robert Hur’s report, which, although it did not charge the president with a crime, painted a picture of apparent lapses in memory after Biden failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information. The former South Carolina governor has frequently taken digs at Biden, who is 81, and former President Donald Trump, 77, over their age, arguing they are both too old to serve another four years as president. Haley, 52, has also been adamant about calling for term limits and mental competency tests for any politician over the age over the age of 75."

Hur’s report released last week did not charge the president with a crime, but it painted a picture of a forgetful commander in chief who failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information – a depiction that could hurt Biden politically and that Republicans have seized on. Hur has retained Bill Burck as his personal attorney. While there is no date on the calendar, they are looking toward the end of February, one of the sources told CNN. The Justice Department declined to comment. House Republicans leading the impeachment inquiry also asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to turn over the transcript of the special counsel’s interview with the president in a new letter on Monday. The Republican committee chairs are also asking the Department of Justice to supply Congress with “any recordings, notes, or summaries” of the special counsel’s interview with the president. Beyond that, Republicans request the Justice Department turn over classified documents related to Ukraine as they continue to attempt to draw connections between Biden’s official actions as vice president and his son’s foreign business dealings at the time. “There is concern that President Biden may have retained sensitive documents related to specific countries involving his family’s foreign business dealings” House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, Oversight Chair James Comer and Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith wrote in the letter. The two special counsels appointed during the Trump presidency, Robert Mueller and John Durham, both testified to Congress once they submitted their reports to the Justice Department. After expressing some reluctance, Mueller agreed to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees in July 2019 about his investigation, delivering halting and stilted responses that mostly stuck to his report. The negotiations for Mueller’s appearance stretched out for weeks, ultimately leading to an agreement where Mueller appeared after he was subpoenaed. Last June, Durham testified to the House Judiciary Committee about his investigation and report into the FBI’s probe into Trump and Russia, and he spoke behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee. Hur’s special counsel report found that Biden willfully retained classified information, including top secret documents, and knew he was in possession of some documents as far back as 2017. He also shared some of that information with the ghostwriter of his 2017 memoir. The special counsel decided not to charge the president in the case – primarily because he found that nothing proved a willful intent by Biden to illegally hold onto classified information and the president cooperated with the investigation. Yet, in a politically damaging line of reasoning, Hur wrote that one reason Biden wasn’t going to be prosecuted was because he would present to a jury as an elderly man “with a poor memory.” Biden’s lawyers objected to the description – calling it “investigative excess” and accusing Hur of flouting Justice Department rules and norms. The report is sure to become an issue in the 2024 campaign – where Biden’s likely opponent, Donald Trump, is facing criminal charges for his handling of classified material, even though Hur made clear how different the two cases were.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-supreme-court-immunity-filing/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step into the charged dispute over whether he may claim immunity from prosecution, once again pressing the nine justices to resolve a question that could undermine his campaign for a second term. Trump asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block a scathing and unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down last week that flatly rejected his claims of immunity from election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. “Conducting a months-long criminal trial of President Trump at the height of election season will radically disrupt President Trump’s ability to campaign against President Biden,” Trump’s attorneys wrote in their request.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Related article Takeaways from the scathing appeals court ruling denying immunity to Donald Trump The DC Circuit’s ruling “threatens immediate irreparable injury to the First Amendment interests of President Trump and tens of millions of American voters, who are entitled to hear President Trump’s campaign message as they decide how to cast their ballots in November.” The emergency filing instantly shoves the Supreme Court into the unusual position of having to juggle two politically fraught matters involving the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Four days ago, the court heard a historic argument over whether Trump should be disqualified from the ballot for his actions on January 6, 2021. The special counsel’s office has until February 20 to respond, but Smith – who is eager to speed up the proceedings – is likely to file much sooner. How the Supreme Court acts on Trump’s request will have huge influence on whether – and how quickly – the former president will be put on trial for criminal allegations as he seeks the Republican nomination and presidency again. Trump took the unusual step of saying he might seek to two avenues to appeal the earlier decision: An appeal to the Supreme Court and, potentially, a separate rehearing before the full DC Circuit. That move underscored Trump’s unusual position in a case where he was incentivized to file at the Supreme Court but also wants to preserve his ability to keep the immunity question before the appeals court. “Former President Trump is making it rather clear that his goal is to stretch out these proceedings as much as possible,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. While that won’t necessarily stop the justices from treating the filing as an appeal, “it underscores Trump’s unambiguous endgame here, which is to play out the string for as long as the courts will let him,” Vladeck added. A panel of three DC Circuit judges set an aggressive timeline for Trump to appeal, nudging him directly to the Supreme Court and effectively requiring him to make his request by Monday. A key part of Trump’s legal strategy has been to delay his criminal cases until after the 2024 election. The fight over Trump’s immunity had already prompted US District Judge Tanya Chutkan to postpone a trial date previously set for March 4. Chief Justice John Roberts, who handles emergency appeals from the DC Circuit, will likely set out a schedule quickly that will offer clues about the timing. Smith, eager to avoid further delay in starting a trial, is expected to push for a quick resolution. Generally, it takes the votes of five justices to grant a stay. At issue is a striking 57-page unanimous opinion from the DC Circuit on Tuesday that allowed Trump to face charges for actions he took while in office and brushed aside his claims that former presidents are immune from such prosecution. “We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter,” the court wrote. “Former President Trump lacked any lawful discretionary authority to defy federal criminal law and he is answerable in court for his conduct.” Broadly, Trump argued in court that presidents might be hesitant to act if they were concerned about the prospect of criminal charges after they left office. His criminal indictment in the 2020 election interference probe, if allowed to stand, would have a “chilling effect” on future administrations, he said. But US Circuit Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Florence Pan and J. Michelle Childs rejected all of Trump’s arguments that those principles conferred sweeping protections to a former president. The judges were clear that the allegations against Trump are serious and left no question they believe the charges can be prosecuted. The panel repeatedly eviscerated Trump’s alleged behavior after the 2020 presidential election as unpresidential and constituting an assault on American institutions. The case has already made its way to the Supreme Court once before. In December, the justices rejected a request from Smith to leapfrog the DC Circuit and decide the immunity question on an expedited basis. At that time, the court did not explain its reasoning and there were no noted dissents. Trump’s lawyers referenced the earlier decision in the very first line of their brief, quoting the renowned late Yankees catcher Yogi Berra. “This application is ‘déjà vu all over again,’” Trump’s attorneys wrote. During more than two hours of oral arguments Thursday in the separate ballot case, most of the justices appeared willing to side with Trump on the question of whether he can appear on the ballot or if his actions on January 6 made him ineligible under the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban.” The court may have to decide how it wants to handle the former president’s immunity claim at the same time it is drafting an opinion in the ballot case. Together, the cases have thrust the court into the middle of this year’s presidential election in a way it has largely managed to avoid since its decision in Bush v. Gore effectively decided the 2000 election between former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Al Gore. This story has been updated with additional details."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/fafsa-processing-delays/index.html,"Washington CNN — The Department of Education said Tuesday that it’s taking steps to speed up college financial aid awards for the upcoming 2024-25 school year after a bumpy rollout of the new Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA. It’s the first time students and their families are using a simpler version of the FAFSA to apply for student loans and grants. With the new form, more students are expected to be eligible for more financial aid – but the rollout has been plagued with delays. First, the form – which is usually released on October 1 – wasn’t widely available until early January. Then, after making a last-minute change to the financial aid calculation, the Department of Education said that it won’t be able to transfer students’ financial information to colleges until the first half of March – more than a month later than expected . The Department of Education has been facing criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for the delays. A group of Republicans sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office last month asking for an investigation. On Monday, more than 100 Democratic lawmakers called on Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to urgently address the operational problems. “Any delays in financial aid processing will most impact the students that need aid most,” wrote the lawmakers in a letter led by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia. Department of Education officials have repeatedly said that overhauling the FAFSA has been a major, complicated undertaking that has been made more challenging by a lack of resources. In 2022, the Biden administration requested additional funding to handle a bigger workload, but Congress left its budget the same as the year before . Steps to speed up financial aid awards On Tuesday, the Department of Education announced three steps to help free up time for colleges to prepare financial aid packages before students must make a decision about where to enroll next school year. First, the agency will select fewer FAFSA filers for an added, often lengthy, process called verification to confirm that everything on the form is accurate. In past years, about one-third of applicants were selected for the audit-like process. Previously, the Department of Education waived some kinds of verification for students submitting the FAFSA for the 2021-22 award year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Second, the department is going to suspend all new routine program reviews, which are usually conducted to confirm a college is eligible to receive federal funds. In past years, several hundred college programs were reviewed annually. The agency will still conduct the review for programs related to the most serious issues like suspected fraud. Third, the Department of Education is giving colleges more flexibility to recertify eligibility for federal aid by temporarily waiving a requirement to apply 90 days before the expiration date. “The flexibility will give more time back to those institutions at this critical moment, so they can focus on getting students the aid they need,” Cardona said on a call with reporters Monday. Last week, the Department of Education also announced that it will be providing personnel, funding, resources and technology to some colleges and universities to help them get financial aid packages to students as quickly as possible. What is the FAFSA and how has it changed? The FAFSA determines eligibility for federal Pell grants and federal student loans – and in most cases, the financial aid provided by colleges as well. The form has long been due for an update, and the new version released at the end of last year is a culmination of changes approved by Congress in 2019 and 2020. In previous years, the FAFSA could be as long as 108 questions. With the new form, some applicants will have to answer as few as 18 questions, which would take less than 10 minutes to complete, according to the Department of Education . Some information is now directly taken from a filer’s tax return so that the applicant doesn’t have to hunt down numbers on old tax returns. With the new FAFSA, an increased number of families is expected to be eligible for financial aid. In fact, the Department of Education estimates that 610,000 more students will qualify for a Pell grant on an annual basis. The Pell grant program is a key way the federal government helps students from low-income families go to college by providing eligible students with money they don’t have to pay back. And an estimated 1.5 million more students will be eligible for the maximum Pell grant amount, which typically changes each year. The Pell grant is worth up to $7,395 during the current school year."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/supreme-courts-easy-out-on-trump-ballot-battle-could-lead-to-post-election-chaos/index.html,"CNN — When it comes to deciding whether former President Donald Trump should be booted from Colorado’s ballot , the easiest path the Supreme Court could take now may wind up causing the most chaos early next year. That’s the dire warning from a group of legal experts who fear the court may punt on the biggest question of the blockbuster case challenging Trump’s eligibility for a second term – whether the former president took part in an insurrection – and rule that it’s up to Congress, not states, to enforce the “insurrection ban” included in the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court listens to oral arguments from Jason Murray, the attorney representing a group of Colorado voters challenging Donald Trump's eligibility for the 2024 ballot, on February 8. Bill Hennessy Related article John Roberts has a united court on Trump. Now comes the hard part In interviews and court documents, legal scholars have used phrases like “catastrophic constitutional crisis,” “political instability” and “horrendously ugly” to caution the justices against taking the easy way out of a dispute they predict could “come back with a vengeance” next year if Trump wins the election. “This is volatile stuff,” said Gerard Magliocca, law professor at Indiana University and one of the nation’s foremost experts on the ban. Based on their questions during more than two hours of oral arguments Thursday, a broad majority appeared sympathetic to Trump’s claim that Colorado did not have the authority to remove him. But that wouldn’t answer the question of whether Congress can decide he’s ineligible to serve. If the justices decide states cannot enforce the ban – and if Trump wins the general election in November – it could prompt a fight over whether Congress must enforce it. Democratic lawmakers, the theory goes, would challenge Trump’s eligibility when electoral votes are counted next January. “If the court says only that states cannot enforce (the ban) against presidential candidates, that is not the same as saying that Trump is eligible to serve,” said Magliocca, who backed the Colorado voters challenging Trump. “The court would be taking no view on that question. And that means that if Trump wins, people will feel free to go to Congress on January 6, 2025, and ask them to declare him ineligible.” The ballot case is separate from Trump’s claim of immunity from criminal prosecution, which landed at the Supreme Court on Monday . Trump asked the high court in that case to block a ruling from the DC Circuit that rejected his claim of immunity from election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. In the ballot litigation, Trump is appealing a decision from the Colorado Supreme Court in December that he incited the attack on the US Capitol as electoral votes were being counted in 2021. Arguments at the US Supreme Court last week focused less on whether there was an insurrection and more on technical questions about whether states may enforce the ban. A decision could come at any time. Many experts speculate Chief Justice John Roberts may be eager to deal with the ballot case quickly and with something close to unanimity. If he is seeking a ruling that can capture support from conservative and liberal justices, he would most likely avoid discussion of whether Trump took part in an insurrection. Video Ad Feedback Why Van Jones thinks the Supreme Court hearing was 'frustrating' 02:33 - Source: CNN Before arguments took place, some scholars were sounding an alarm about a decision that doesn’t resolve fundamental questions about Trump’s role on January 6, 2021. A brief filed last month by three prominent election law experts warned of a worst-case scenario they said would “fan the flames of public conflict.” “Even worse for the political stability of the nation is the prospect that Congress may actually vote in favor of his disqualification after he has apparently won election in the Electoral College,” the lawyers wrote. “Neither Mr. Trump nor his supporters, whose votes effectively will have been discarded as void, are likely to take such a declaration lying down.” And, they wrote, the rules about what happens next if Congress were to find Trump ineligible are “dangerously unclear.” How to avoid January 6 election chaos The court could avoid the uncertainty by clearly holding, for instance, that Trump wasn’t involved in an insurrection or that the 14th Amendment’s ban doesn’t apply to former presidents. Trump argued that when the insurrection ban referred to someone serving as an “officer of the United States,” that language meant federal officials appointed by the president, not the presidency itself. It might also embrace one of Trump’s earlier arguments that his words at a rally outside the White House before the Capitol attack were protected by the First Amendment. “Any of those… rulings would not leave the issue open to Congress,” said Edward Foley, director of the election law program at The Ohio State University and one of the authors of the brief filed at the Supreme Court last month. A political fight over eligibility would likely be limited to Congress, but it could sweep the Supreme Court back into the thicket, as well. “Depending on just how horrendously ugly the situation could get, the court might feel compelled to become involved,” Foley said.

Politically, Democrats would have to win a majority of both houses to have a chance of success. And if they were successful, the election would be sent to the House of Representatives to choose the next president – an outcome, Muller said, that “no one wants to see.” CNN’s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/us-concerns-russia-north-korea-relations/index.html,"CNN — North Korea watchers in Washington have fixated recently on Pyongyang’s abrupt destruction last month of a key monument dedicated to reunifying the Korean Peninsula — a move that some outside analysts view as a precursor to war with South Korea amid typically bellicose rhetoric from leader Kim Jong Un. But US officials and North Korea analysts who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity say the uproar over the reunification arch obscures a far greater strategic threat: North Korea’s burgeoning partnership with Russia. Intelligence officials in Washington are increasingly concerned about the growing ties between North Korea and Russia, and the long-term implications of what appears to be a new level of strategic partnership between the two nations, according to multiple officials familiar with the latest intelligence. Russia has repeatedly fired North Korean-supplied short-range ballistic missiles at Ukrainian targets in recent weeks. In January, high-ranking North Korean and Russian diplomats met in Moscow in advance of what North Korean state media says is a forthcoming visit to Pyongyang by Russian President Vladimir Putin himself — his first in more than 20 years. The Biden administration is concerned enough that national security adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issue with the Chinese foreign minister during a January meeting, a senior White House official told reporters late last month. If North Korea is able to use a tighter relationship with Russia to loosen China’s influence, officials fear, that could remove what some believe has been an important handbrake on Pyongyang’s nuclear testing program. “I think [Kim] is constantly looking for some kind of an edge,” a senior defense official said. A senior administration official told reporters in late January, “We are deeply concerned about the recent testing of weapons. We are deeply concerned about the growing relationship between Russia and the DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] and what that might mean for Mr. Kim’s intentions.” Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said Pyongyang has long sought to balance Chinese influence over its affairs by pursuing dialogue with other nations — including the Soviet Union and, later, the United States. North Korea’s newly forged transactional partnership with Moscow is best understood as Kim seizing an opportunity to give himself maneuvering room with China, Lewis and others said. Risks to the US The risks that relationship poses to US interests are numerous, according to multiple analysts both inside and outside of government. Although Lewis and others believe the US often overestimates the degree of control Beijing has over North Korea, it does have influence and seeks to ensure stability on the peninsula. But North Korea is “terrified that the Chinese are going to functionally take over the country, not with an army, but culturally and financially,” Lewis said. Russia is “a very natural alliance that allows them to reduce their dependency on China,” he said. An infusion of Russian cash — and potentially Russian technology — in exchange for North Korean missiles could also jumpstart North Korea’s defense industrial base, allowing Pyongyang to update its stockpiles of conventional munitions and giving its economy a much-needed boost. That, in turn, could accelerate its missile development program. Trade with Russia could also further weaken the sanctions regime the US has placed on North Korea, also accelerating its economy and potentially bolstering its arms development program. And perhaps most alarmingly, North Korean missiles on the Russian battlefield could act as an advertisement for further sales to other rogue regimes. “These are credible battlefield tools, and should North Korea succeed in selling these, it would enable them to build more and help in their domestic deployment — and, of course, have a snowball effect to find even more customers,” said Sydney Seiler, the national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council until 2023. Lewis, Seiler and others cautioned that none of these outcomes are foretold. As always with North Korea, deciphering how the hermit kingdom may respond is like reading chicken bones. But within government, officials are watching the dynamic closely. For weeks, a blog post on an influential North Korea watchers website written by two former analysts circulated within the US government. It warned that Pyongyang’s decision to abandon reunification was a clear signal that North Korea had made the “strategic decision to go to war.” The problem, according to more than half a dozen US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence, was that the piece was wrong. “I do not think [Kim] has made a strategic decision to conflict,” the senior defense official said. “I have not seen anything indicative of strategic conflict.” Kim doesn’t seem to be preparing an attack Five US officials told CNN the US has seen no signs Kim is preparing for a potential attack on South Korea, or a broader provocation involving nuclear weapons. If anything, some analysts believe, North Korea’s public statements signal that North Korea is abandoning its reunification policy in pursuit of peace on the peninsula. Kim’s “No. 1 priority is the sustainment of his regime,” the defense official said. “That’s not a shift — that’s been a strategic priority of his entire family since the Korean War.” Lewis, Seiler and others said Kim is very consistent in publicly messaging his intentions. In speeches announcing the abandonment of reunification, Kim made clear that he was not seeking war with South Korea. “Kim went out of his way to explicitly say that one implication of rejecting reunification was that he was also rejecting reunification by force — so the clear message was that North Korea would not initiate a war with South Korea,” Lewis said, adding that it was “the weirdest reassurance in history.” That does not mean Pyongyang might not launch lower-level attacks short of all-out war, analysts said — something North Korea occasionally does for reasons that can be opaque to US intelligence. Pyongyang often uses military exercises in the region conducted by the US, South Korea and Japan beginning this time of year as an opportunity to engage in what the US terms “provocative” actions. “But it’s not war. We’re not headed to war,” Seiler said. “We are headed to what I think would be a higher-tension season, but if we stay the course, we’ll come out the other end OK.” In 2010, North Korea shelled a South Korean island, and the two sides exchanged artillery fire that killed troops on both sides. But the conflict never escalated. The senior defense official said that, for now, the US does not see any indicators that North Korea is preparing for anything like that, but noted, “I get paid to think about such possibilities.” North Korea is also unlikely to step back from its missile development program — something that defense officials watch with alarm, even as they broadly believe Pyongyang views the program as defensive rather than offensive. Officials still believe North Korea could be poised to carry out another nuclear test. And Pyongyang has made notable improvements in the solid fuels used for shorter- and longer-range missiles. Because solid fuels can be stored in the field for weeks at a time, US officials are concerned the improved technology will allow North Korea to move its missiles around and hide them from foreign surveillance more easily. “Their increasing and continual launching of missile tests — that I think is the most concerning part,” the senior defense official said. “I worry about errant missiles going off to potentially hit a populated area. Even if not deliberate, that’s an action that could be devastating.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-endorse-michael-whatley-lara-trump-rnc/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump has endorsed North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley to succeed Ronna McDaniel as Republican National Committee chair. Alongside endorsing Whatley, Trump said in a statement that he will also throw his support behind Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, for the role of co-chairwoman at the RNC. Trump’s endorsement solidifies his effort to bring about a leadership change and exert control over the committee. As part of the plan, Chris LaCivita, Trump’s co-campaign manager, has been tapped to serve as the RNC chief operating officer but will continue in his current role. “For these reasons, I think my friend Michael Whatley should be the RNC’s next leader. Michael h﻿as been with me from the beginning, has done a great job in his home state of North Carolina, and is committed to election integrity, which we must have to keep fraud out of our election so it can’t be stolen,” Trump said in a statement. Michael Whatley, North Carolina Republican Party Chairman, speaks during a campaign event for President Donald Trump in Dallas, North Carolina, in October 2020. Al Drago/Reuters Related article Likely frontrunner for RNC chair parroted Trump’s 2020 election lies “My very talented daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, has agreed to run as the RNC Co-Chair. Lara is an extremely talented communicator and is dedicated to all that MAGA stands for. She has told me she wants to accept this challenge and would be GREAT!” he also said. The endorsements from Trump come after weeks of behind-the-scenes jockeying to lead the RNC as tensions between the GOP front-runner and the committee spilled into public view. Trump and his top advisers had recently become dissatisfied with McDaniel’s leadership, resulting in pressure for the chairwoman to step down. That pressure became apparent when the former president met with McDaniel for two hours at Mar-a-Lago just days after the RNC’s annual winter meeting. As CNN previously reported , McDaniel had offered to leave her position following the South Carolina primary later this month to allow the former president to install his own party chair, according to two party advisers. It’s not unusual for a party nominee to quickly move to change leadership and install key lieutenants in their national committee after becoming either the de facto or official nominee. While Trump has not yet secured his party’s nomination, he is the far-and-away front-runner in the GOP primary. Polls show the former president leading former Gov. Nikki Haley in the upcoming South Carolina Republican primary. Trump’s endorsement carries substantial weight among the 168 Republican National Committee members, who elect a new chair and co-chair. Haley’s campaign responded to the endorsements Monday night, saying that Trump “is rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.” “Under Donald Trump and current RNC leadership, Republicans lost elections in 2018, 2020, and 2022, and now the RNC is effectively bankrupt,” campaign manager Betsy Ankney said in a statement, adding that Haley would push for everyone at the RNC to be fired. Whatley had emerged in recent days as a favorite of Trump’s for the chairmanship. South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Drew McKissick and Florida Republican National Committeeman Joe Gruters had also been mentioned, but Trump and his team strongly signaled their preference for Whatley. A CNN KFile review of Whatley’s comments following the 2020 presidential election found that he promoted lies and supported using the courts to overturn the results. Whatley, who has since acknowledged Joe Biden is the country’s legitimate president, serves as general counsel at the RNC overseeing litigation and what the organization calls its “election integrity” efforts.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/cq-brown-nato-trump/index.html,"CNN — Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown said Monday that “US credibility is at stake” in the wake of comments from former President Donald Trump that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO partners that don’t meet spending guidelines on defense. Asked by “NBC Nightly News” about Trump’s admission that he would not abide by the collective-defense clause at the heart of NATO if reelected, Brown said that the alliance is strong and has been around for 75 years. “I think we have a responsibility to uphold those alliances,” Brown told NBC’s Lester Holt in an interview airing Monday evening. “US credibility is at stake with each of our alliances, and US leadership is still needed, wanted, and watched.” “The US is committed,” Brown added. “And that’s the message I communicate, and that’s the message that’s been received.” Brown’s remarks come as Trump, the 2024 Republican front-runner, has come under fire for his comments over the weekend indicating he does not intend to defend NATO allies from Russian attack if he is reelected. Former President Donald Trump speaks as he holds a campaign rally at Coastal Carolina University ahead of the South Carolina Republican presidential primary in Conway, South Carolina, on February 10. Sam Wolfe/Reuters Related article Trump will pull US out of NATO if he wins election, ex-adviser warns At a rally in South Carolina Saturday, Trump recalled a conversation he had while president with “one of the presidents of a big country,” who asked him whether the US would defend them from a Russian invasion even if they “don’t pay.” “No, I would not protect you,” he recalled saying. “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.” According to NBC , Brown said that he realizes there will be “various dialogue in discussions at the political level,” but that he will focus on “continuing to build and strengthen our relationship with NATO.” “My job is to make sure that we are doing everything we can with our NATO allies on the military aspect,” he said, “and I’ll continue to do that throughout.” Brown, who was sworn in as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff last fall, serves as the principal military advisor to the president. The military officer who serves in the role does so at the pleasure of the president, meaning that if Trump were reelected this year, Brown could serve as his chairman unless he appointed another officer. Gen. Mark Milley , Brown’s predecessor and Trump’s chairman of the Joint Chiefs throughout his tenure, was a frequent target of Trump’s ire, and the two have taken verbal - sometimes subtle - shots at each other after Trump left the White House. In late September, at the change of command ceremony between Milley and Brown, the outgoing chairman made it a point to underscore where his loyalty and the loyalty of the military should lie. “We don’t take an oath to a king, or a queen, or a tyrant or a dictator. And we don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,” Milley said at the time, in a veiled reference to Trump. “We take an oath to the Constitution and we take an oath to the idea that is America – and we’re willing to die to protect it.” Milley chose to deliver the scathing criticism of his former boss in his last address as the nation’s top general as he stood next to President Joe Biden. In a continuation of the acrimonious feud between the two, Trump fired back on social media, calling Milley a “moron” and “STUPID & VERY DANGEROUS!” Brown addressed recent criticism of his boss Monday following mention of apparent memory lapses in special counsel Robert Hur’s report , calling Biden “pretty sharp.” Asked whether he was surprised by the comments made about the president’s memory, Brown said he was, adding they were “not characteristic of what I’ve seen.” “He’s got a very good grasp of the issues,” Brown said. “He asks, I think, very pertinent questions.” Iran likely ‘not looking for a broader conflict’ with US As the US is navigating increasingly high tensions in the Middle East — from Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria, the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, and Israel’s campaign in Gaza against Hamas — Brown echoed comments made by other US officials that deterrence is key. Broadly, the US is focused on deterring “any further aggression,” Brown said, while also protecting American forces. Asked whether he believed Iran wants a war with the US, Brown responded, “I don’t know that they do.” “Having watched Iran operate, they will do things through their militia groups and others to put pressure, to achieve their objectives,” the chairman said. “At the same time, not looking for a broader conflict with the United States.” There have been at least 170 attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq, Syria and Jordan since October 17. The Pentagon said Monday that those attacks have resulted in 186 wounded or killed in action — including 130 traumatic brain injuries. Three US soldiers were killed in a drone attack in January on a US outpost in Jordan.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/bidens-meeting-with-jordanian-king-comes-at-flashpoint-in-israel-hamas-war/index.html,"Washington CNN — President Joe Biden and King Abdullah II of Jordan met Monday aiming to figure out how to move the Israel-Hamas war into a new phase in which Israeli hostages are released and fighting stops for a prolonged period of time. “The key elements of the deal are on the table,” Biden said while addressing reporters alongside the king at the White House. “There are gaps that remain, but I’ve encouraged Israeli leaders to keep working to achieve the deal. The United States will do everything possible to make it happen.” Biden did not elaborate on what the “gaps” in the deal are. He added that a planned Israeli operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah should not go forward without a “credible plan” to protect civilians. “Many people there have been displaced, displaced multiple times,” Biden said from the White House on Monday, “fleeing the violence to the north, and now they’re packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable.” “They need to be protected,” Biden added. Biden added that he and Abdullah discussed “a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, which would bring immediate and sustained period of calm into Gaza, for at least six weeks, which we could then take the time to build into something more enduring,” during the meeting. But Abdullah, the first Arab leader to visit the White House since Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, went further – reiterating his call for a complete ceasefire, which Biden has so far resisted. “We cannot stand by and let this continue,” the Jordanian king told reporters. “We need a lasting ceasefire now. This war must end.” He said it was essential the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the main United Nations agency responsible for Gaza, continues to receive funding. The agency warned earlier this month it may have to halt its work in Gaza after the US and other nations withdrew support last month over allegations some of its staff were involved with Hamas’ October 7 attack. Abdullah also said in his remarks that a ground operation in Rafah would amount to devastation, adding it would “produce another humanitarian catastrophe.” “The situation is already unbearable for over a million people who have been pushed into Rafah since the war started,” Abdullah said. While the Jordanian king called Biden a “dear friend” and said the president’s leadership is “key to addressing this conflict,” the open rifts between Biden and Abdullah underscored the delicate diplomatic balance the president is facing as the war in Gaza enters its fifth month – and as he faces a possible inflection point in his presidency. In the wake of special counsel Robert Hur’s report , which contained politically embarrassing passages about the president’s memory, Biden is facing perhaps the most scrutiny of his presidency over his mental acuity. The 81-year-old president’s age is his biggest political problem, and the special counsel’s report has struck a nerve, as evidenced by Biden’s amped-up news conference just hours after it published. But that domestic political pressure has not obscured the foreign crises that have occupied much of the president’s term in office, and it was during that news conference that Biden leveled his latest ramped-up criticism at Israel, calling its response to the October 7 terror attack “over the top.” The president was aiming to show off his command of the issues at hand when King Abdullah, a key regional ally who has been critical of Israel’s campaign in Gaza, comes to the West Wing. The president’s supporters have frequently pointed to the Israel-Hamas war as evidence of Biden’s mental faculties being in good shape. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday pushed back against concerns about the president’s age as she recounted in detail the experience serving alongside Biden in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7 attack, noting that she was in “almost every meeting” with him and his national security team in the days that followed. Biden sat for interviews with Hur on October 8 and 9. “The president was in front of and on top of it all, asking questions and requiring that America’s military and intelligence community and diplomatic community would figure out and know – how many people are dead, how many Americans, how many hostages, is the situation stable?” Harris said. And Democratic Rep. Daniel Goldman of New York, who spoke by phone with Biden a day ahead of his October 8 interview with Hur, said the president was “sharper than anyone I’ve spoken to” about the situation in the Middle East. In his meeting with King Abdullah, Biden had some high-pressure issues to work through as the Jordanians have called on the White House to put more pressure on Israel over its campaign against Hamas in Gaza, which has taken an immense humanitarian toll. Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority canceled a planned meeting with Biden less than 24 hours before a planned four-way summit in the Jordanian capital, Amman, in October when he traveled to Israel. The cancellation followed a massive blast in Gaza’s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital that reportedly killed hundreds of Palestinians. The Jordanian and Egyptian governments have called for a ceasefire in Gaza, while Biden has resisted making a similar call. And the meeting came just weeks after three American soldiers were killed during an attack at a base in Jordan last month, prompting the US to launch dozens of retaliatory strikes that targeted Iran-backed militias. But the top order of business was how to achieve a cessation to fighting that also involves the release of hostages still held by Hamas since the October 7 terror attack on Israel. There are 136 hostages being held in Gaza, including 132 who were captured during Hamas’ October 7 attack. Twenty-nine of the hostages are dead, according to the Israeli prime minister’s office. Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed a deal to secure the release of hostages in Gaza at length on Sunday, according to a senior administration official, who cautioned that while a framework is in place, gaps remain. Over the last several months, the US has attempted to put more pressure on the Israeli government to support a “humanitarian pause” in its war against Hamas. But those efforts have yielded little success. Last week, Netanyahu called Hamas’ recent proposals for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza “delusional.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken previously said negotiations toward an agreement would continue despite the Israeli prime minister’s comments, which Blinken said were referencing the “absolute non-starters” in the proposal. The full Hamas response proposes three phases, each lasting 45 days, including the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, a massive humanitarian effort, and freedom of movement for people throughout Gaza, according to a copy obtained by CNN.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/nikki-haley-husband-trump-attack/index.html,"CNN — Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is hammering Donald Trump over his comments mocking the absence of her husband , who is deployed overseas, and using the former president’s remarks to highlight his long history of disparaging members of the military. The strategy is unlikely to change the dynamics of the GOP primary ahead of her home state’s February 24 primary. But it showcases how her continued presence in the race has presented a thorn in Trump’s side, as she continues to criticize and provoke him in ads, on cable TV and on the campaign trail. In interviews, fundraising messages and a new digital ad, Haley has framed the former president’s comments as part of an ongoing pattern of disrespect toward military members and their service and says it is further evidence that he would run an undisciplined general election campaign and presidency. Haley called Trump’s comments “disgusting,” “awful” and “unhinged” during an appearance on “The Lead with Jake Tapper.” Someone who would make such comments doesn’t deserve to be commander in chief, she said. “If you don’t respect our military, how should we think you’re going to respect them when it comes to times of war, and prevent war and keep them from going?” Haley said Monday. “If you don’t have respect for our military and our veterans, God help us all if that’s the case.” Haley made the comments after spending most of Monday blasting Trump. During a gaggle with reporters in Elgin, South Carolina, Monday afternoon, she said his comments put servicemembers at risk by implying Trump doesn’t support them and called out his own lack of military experience. “The most harm he’s ever come across is whether a golf ball hits him on a golf cart,” she told reporters. “And you’re gonna go and mock our men and women in the military? I don’t care what party you’re in, that’s not okay.” Neither Trump nor Haley has served in the military. Trump avoided being drafted into the Vietnam War due to five deferments, one for bone spurs and four for education. Her campaign has pointed to several comments Trump has made both publicly or privately over the years. In September 2020, the Atlantic reported that Trump called soldiers who died in combat “losers” and “suckers” and questioned why veterans buried at Arlington National Cemetery would enlist. John Kelly, a former Trump chief of staff, confirmed several details in the report to CNN last year. In 2015, during his first presidential run, Trump said he liked “people who weren’t captured” as he attacked Sen. John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Three years later, he suggested retired Navy Adm. William McRaven, who oversaw the military operation that killed Osama bin Laden, should have completed the mission sooner. On Saturday, Trump noted that Haley’s husband, Michael, has not appeared on the campaign trail with her. “What happened to her husband? Where is he?” Trump said at a rally Saturday in Conway, South Carolina. “He’s gone.” Michael Haley is an officer of the South Carolina Army National Guard who is currently deployed supporting the US Africa Command. Throughout her campaign, Nikki Haley has pointed to her husband’s military service to make the case for investing more in services for veterans and to push back on criticisms that she’s too hawkish. Her campaign has said they’ve engaged with voters who were angered by his comments, noting the Palmetto State is home to a large swath of military families. It’s not clear that hitting Trump over his comments will change the dynamics in the race. A recent Monmouth/Washington Post poll in South Carolina found Haley trailing Trump by 26 points in the state, and her campaign has struggled to outline her path to the nomination. But her response has demonstrated where Trump might be weak in the general election. On Sunday, President Joe Biden – Trump’s likely general election opponent – defended the Haleys on X, formerly known as Twitter. “We know he thinks our troops are ‘suckers,’ but this guy wouldn’t know service to his country if it slapped him in the face,” Biden wrote on the site. For her part, Haley’s criticisms of Trump only intensified on Monday. Her campaign has fundraised off the comments, offering shirts that say “We Love Our Military” to supporters who donate $15 to her campaign. Also on Monday, her campaign released a digital ad highlighting Trump’s history of disparaging remarks towards members of the military with news clips and video of her response to Trump at a rally in South Carolina over the weekend, in which she called on him to debate her. “If you mock the service of a combat veteran, you don’t deserve a driver’s license, let alone being president of the United States,” she says in the ad. And she continued to knock Trump at campaign events in South Carolina Monday. “You can’t have a commander-in-chief that doesn’t understand what made this country great,” Haley said at a stop in Laurens, South Carolina. “It’s the values, it’s the sacrifice, it’s the freedom. That’s what we fight for every day.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/biden-campaign-channels-jill-bidens-frustration-over-special-counsel-report/index.html,"Washington CNN — The renewed questions surrounding President Joe Biden’s age and memory sparked by a special counsel report last week were decidedly unwelcome for the 81-year-old Democrat’s advisers. Yet in one area, the president’s team has found a way of making political hay from one of the president’s deepest political vulnerabilities . A fundraising appeal sent Saturday from first lady Dr. Jill Biden criticizing the special counsel and defending her husband was the second-most lucrative money-raising email since the president’s launch announcement, a source familiar with the figures said. The source declined to offer an exact amount raised, but what made the email unique is that the first lady made no explicit ask for supporters to give money to the campaign in the body of her message. Instead, the message included a button with a link to donate after the first lady signed off, “Love, Jill.” The success of the fundraising message, in which Jill Biden argued special counsel Robert Hur’s report contains “inaccurate and personal political attacks against Joe,” speaks to a silver lining amid the questions about Biden’s age, which had been festering well before the release of Hur’s report last week. In many ways, the lengthy document forced Biden’s team to more forcefully address an issue that had been lingering uncomfortably for months, as voters expressed deep concerns about the president’s ability to serve a second term. For months, White House aides have sought to avoid moments that might highlight Biden’s advanced years, like using a smaller flight of stairs to board Air Force One. The president has also conducted few sit-down interviews and held fewer news conferences, though he frequently answers reporters’ questions in less formal settings. The president and his advisers have bristled at questions about Biden’s cognitive abilities and advanced age, and have claimed interest in the issue is a media obsession. Yet the release of Hur’s report thrust those questions to the center of the election, requiring the White House and campaign to tackle the age concerns more head-on. Speaking to a group of county executives Monday, Biden himself seemed to make a veiled allusion to the report and its questioning of his recall abilities. “I know I don’t look like it, but I’ve been around a while,” the president told the group in Washington. “I do remember that,” he added with a smirk, to loud applause. In voicing indignation at Hur’s treatment of the matter in his report – and in particular expressing frustration with the special counsel claiming her husband couldn’t remember when their son Beau died – Jill Biden struck upon a potent message for Democrats. “Believe me, like anyone who has lost a child, Beau and his death never leave him. I hope you can imagine how it felt to read that attack – not just as Joe’s wife, but as Beau’s mother,” Dr. Biden wrote. “I don’t know what this Special Counsel was trying to achieve. We should give everyone grace, and I can’t imagine someone would try to use our son’s death to score political points.” Yet she also sought to link Biden’s age – a number that will only get higher, and which no official has any ability to change – to experience, an argument that Biden himself has made only sporadically as the general election gets underway. “Joe is 81, that’s true, but he’s 81 doing more in an hour than most people do in a day,” she wrote. “Joe has wisdom, empathy, and vision. He has delivered on so many of his promises as President precisely because he’s learned a lot in those 81 years. His age, with his experience and expertise, is an incredible asset and he proves it every day.” The first lady was involved in crafting the response, which a source close to her said “was from the heart.” Jill Biden felt the “Beau attack was beyond the pale and the attacks on his age were flat inaccurate,” the source said, noting the first lady “wanted to make clear that the American people benefit from his 81 years.” Over the weekend, the president’s social media account also posted a photo of Biden playing football with his sons Beau and Hunter. “1987 with my boys,” the president’s account wrote. Hur’s reference of Beau – who died from brain cancer in 2015 – angered the president the most, prompting him to tell Democratic lawmakers in private, “How would I f***ing” forget” a date etched in his memory. “As legal experts around the country are saying, it just goes off the rails. It’s a shabby piece of work,” Biden’s personal attorney, Bob Bauer, told CBS of the report. In a fundraising appeal on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris joined the Bidens in criticizing the report’s contents. “As a former prosecutor, I can tell you firsthand that the comments that were made by the Special Counsel were unnecessary, inaccurate, and inappropriate,” Harris wrote. “The way that the President’s demeanor was characterized in that report could not be more wrong. It was clearly politically motivated.” Harris also detailed Biden’s response in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 on Israel, calling the hours before the special counsel’s interview with the president “an intense moment for the Commander in Chief of the United States.” “When it comes to the role and responsibility of a prosecutor in a situation like that, we should expect a higher level of integrity than what we saw. Nevertheless, I want you to know the Joe that I know,” Harris wrote. “I’ve been with Joe in the Oval Office when the cameras are there, and when they are not. I’ve watched him bring folks together across the nation and across the world. He is an incredible leader.” Mitch Landrieu, who recently left a White House post to become a co-chair of Biden’s campaign, said the report was an “ad hominem attack that questioned the president’s capacity” and didn’t reflect his own experiences. “This guy is tough. He’s smart. He’s on his game,” he said on NBC."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/fulton-county-fani-willis-trump-hearing/index.html,"CNN — The judge presiding over the Georgia election subversion case against Donald Trump and several co-defendants said Monday that the district attorney who brought the case could be disqualified if she financially benefitted from a personal relationship with her lead prosecutor on the case. A hearing is set for Thursday on motions to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis based on allegations that she and Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired, engaged in an improper romantic relationship that amounted to a conflict of interest. Trump and his co-defendants are also seeking to get the entire case dismissed. “I think it’s clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or an appearance of one,” Judge Scott McAfee said during a hearing on Monday over subpoenas that defense attorneys have issued for Thursday’s dismissal hearing. “The state has admitted a relationship existed,” McAfee said. “So what remains to be proven is the existence and extent of any financial benefit, again if there even was one. Because I think it’s possible that the facts alleged by the defendant could result in disqualification. I think an evidentiary hearing must occur to establish the record on those core allegations.” McAfee was clear, however, that Thursday’s hearing would be limited in scope, noting that not all of the issues raised by defense attorneys over Wade and Willis are relevant. “The issues at point here are whether a relationship existed, whether that relationship was romantic or non-romantic in nature, when it formed and whether it continues,” McAfee said. “And that’s only relevant because it’s in combination with the question of the existence and extent of any benefit conveyed as a result of their relationship.” Video Ad Feedback Law Professor: Why DA Willis should take leave of absence 04:55 - Source: CNN Anna Cross, a lawyer representing the district attorney, attacked the motions to dismiss the case, arguing that defense attorneys who brought the allegations against Willis and Wade were peddling in “gossip.” “The defense is not bringing you facts, the defense is not bringing you law, the defense is bringing you gossip,” Cross said. “The court should not condone that practice.” Willis could also be required to testify, the judge said, noting that the defense attorneys have “established a good faith basis for relevance.” A defense attorney for one of the defendants in the case, Mike Roman, has subpoenaed Willis and several of her staff to testify during Thursday’s hearing. While McAfee said Willis may not be the first witness called on Thursday, he did not rule out the possibility of Willis taking the stand. Willis had sought to quash subpoenas.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/austin-cancels-brussels-trip/index.html,"CNN — US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin canceled a trip to Brussels for NATO and Ukraine meetings later this week as he remains hospitalized at Walter Reed medical center, according to a defense official familiar with the plans. Austin was taken to the hospital Sunday afternoon with symptoms “suggesting an emergent bladder issue,” Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Sunday. Austin was then admitted to the hospital’s critical care unit later in the evening for additional care and close monitoring, the hospital said. Ryder said Monday that Austin is in the intensive care unit “in order to provide appropriate privacy,” and he will remain there for the duration of his stay. Austin’s doctors said in a statement Monday afternoon that Austin underwent “non-surgical procedures under general anesthesia to address his bladder issue.” “We anticipate a successful recovery and will closely monitor him overnight,” the statement said, adding that Austin’s doctors believe he will be able to resume his duties as defense secretary on Tuesday. It is still unclear how long Austin will remain at the hospital, according to medical staff, though his doctors’ statement said they did not anticipate a “prolonged hospital stay.” Austin was supposed to lead a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) in Brussels, followed by a meeting of the NATO Defense Ministerial. Austin attended the January 23 meeting of the UDCG virtually from his home. This week’s meeting of the UDCG will again be held virtually. On Sunday afternoon, Austin transferred his duties to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, notifying the president, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Congress, according to the Pentagon. Ryder said Monday that Austin would be represented at the UDCG by Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, and at the NATO Defense Ministerial by Ambassador Julianne Smith, the US permanent representative to NATO. Austin has faced significant criticism for his failure to notify senior administration officials, including President Joe Biden, of his previous hospitalization and his diagnosis with prostate cancer. Austin is scheduled to testify before the House Armed Services Committee at the end of the month about the failure to notify officials. This time, notification came quickly from the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Austin was taken to the hospital at 2:20 p.m. Sunday, the Pentagon said. Within three hours, the Pentagon said notifications went out to the president, the Joints Chiefs chair and Congress. A subsequent statement said Austin had transferred his responsibilities to his deputy. And shortly before midnight, a third statement said Austin had been admitted to the critical care unit at Walter Reed. The rapid process of notification stands in marked contrast to Austin’s previous hospitalization. It took days for Austin’s office to notify senior administration officials, including Biden , that the defense secretary was in the hospital, and it took even longer to inform officials of Austin’s diagnosis with prostate cancer. Biden said in January that Austin had a lapse in judgement in not notifying the commander in chief about the diagnosis. Austin, in his first news conference after his initial hospitalization, said he directly apologized to the president and was “deeply sorry” for not letting him know. A 30-day review of the notification process was completed last week, but the Pentagon said most of it was classified. Austin said during his news conference that the Pentagon would share “as much as possible as soon as possible.” This story has been updated with additional details."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/11/politics/new-york-democrats-special-election-3rd-district/index.html,"Plainview, New York CNN — How bad were the 2022 midterm elections for Democrats in New York? One way to explain it: Republican George Santos ’ victory in the state’s 3rd Congressional District might have been the highlight of their year. Santos’ troubles began in earnest six weeks after his surprising win, and after a year of scandal and outrage that sullied and undermined leading local Republicans, he was gone – one of only six members to have been bounced from the House and only the third since the Civil War – and the seat was open. Democrats would get another bite at the apple. But as the special election to succeed the disgraced former congressman has made painfully clear to Democrats, Santos’ victory was not a fluke or anomaly. What had been a safely blue suburban Long Island seat for most of the past three decades is, once again, shaping up to be a political battleground. Days out now from Tuesday’s expensive and fiercely contested matchup between Democrat Tom Suozzi, 61, a former House member and a staple of Nassau County politics since first being elected mayor of Glen Cove in 1993, against little-known Mazi Pilip, a 44-year-old Ethiopian-born, Israeli American county legislator, the race is widely considered a toss-up. Suozzi’s brand is still strong; he ran the county during some of its best economic times, before his first election to Congress in 2016. But Pilip, though her ideological bearings remain fuzzy and she has been at times hard to find on the campaign trail, has the prevailing political winds at her back – and the opportunity to both put a stamp on the GOP’s restored primacy on Long Island and emerge as an up-and-coming national figure ahead of the fall’s general election. Ten or 15 years ago, the political dynamics currently roiling the New York suburbs might have seemed as far-fetched as Santos’ claims to a career as a Broadway producer. (Less so 40 years ago, when Republicans ran roughshod here and Ronald Reagan alluded to Nassau County as a Republican’s idea of heaven.) But cascading crises, from a home-building and affordability crisis to more recent panic over crime and immigration, have swung back the pendulum. Nassau County in 2024 is sharply divided and – in a word – angry. It’s a lot like other places across the country that could determine President Joe Biden’s fate in his expected November rematch with former President Donald Trump. “Long Island is running hot, and when people run hot, they run Republican,” said Alyssa Cass, a Democratic strategist. “George Santos was not an accident. His election was the direct result of years and years of careful Republican recruitment, party building and outreach in Long Island.” Democrats on the brink, and Republicans on the rise Though the district broke for Biden over Trump by 8 points in 2020, the signs of a Republican renaissance – and diminishing returns from a disjointed Democratic state party – were soon to come on display. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer lost the county while otherwise cruising to reelection in 2022. The year before, Democrat Laura Curran, the top official in Nassau County, was ousted by Republican Bruce Blakeman. GOP gains continued into 2023 – well after the Santos fiasco was in full flight – and Republicans are now close to dominant in local offices. WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 01: Rep. George Santos (R-NY) is surrounded by journalists as he leaves the U.S. Capitol after his fellow members of Congress voted to expel him from the House of Representatives on December 01, 2023 in Washington, DC. Charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with 23 felonies in New York including fraud and campaign finance violations, Santos, 35, was expelled from the House of Representatives by a vote of 311-114. Santos is only the sixth person in U.S. history to be expelled from the House of Representatives. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Drew Angerer/Getty Images Related article What the race to replace Santos will tell us about the 2024 election Tuesday’s special election, though, is unique in a number of ways. Where New York Democrats garnered little national attention in 2022 – until their slew of losses in suburban seats across the state helped the GOP win control of the House – the party is full throttle behind Suozzi this time out. It also helps that Brooklyn’s Hakeem Jeffries is now the top House Democrat. “Hakeem is a beast – for better or for worse,” said one progressive Democratic operative, who spoke anonymously because of the delicate nature of intrastate politics. “I appreciate the fact that he’s realized that, if you leave the race in the state party’s hands, we’re all going down.” New York state and Nassau County Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs, who rejected calls to resign after the Santos debacle, praised Jeffries and his leadership team for their support – particularly when it’s come to campaign cash – but also suggested that, back in 2022, the local party suffered as much for a lack of interest from national Democrats as their own missteps. “Everybody’s paying attention, where they really weren’t and we were on our own the last time,” Jacobs told CNN. “The county organization did its job last time. It’s doing its job this time. No Democratic voter is going tell you they didn’t hear from the party.” Still, questions remain about the recent Democratic failures, most notable on the island, but also across the state. “Historically, there has never really been a strong (Democratic) party infrastructure here because the state party was just the governor’s thing,” Curran told CNN. “He could boss it around and tell it what to do. So there’s not a machine, there’s not a real boots-on-the-ground operation.” It’s been a different story this campaign. Grassroots progressive groups like Engage Long Island, which is part of the Indivisible network, have been feverishly knocking on doors – taking their case directly to like-minded neighbors. And Suozzi has massively outraised Pilip, taking in $4.5 million to her $1.3 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings that cover the beginning of October through January 24 of this year. Curran, a centrist ally of Suozzi, doesn’t blame former Gov. Andrew Cuomo or Jacobs for the state party’s failures – her ire is directed at leftist Democrats in New York City Hall and the state Legislature. But more liberal New York Democrats often point to the current problems as Cuomo’s legacy. And even with Cuomo gone, Jacobs is now, again, a trusted ally of the governor, Democrat Kathy Hochul, who clinched a full term in 2022 – but only by a little more than 6 points. (Four years earlier, Cuomo had won reelection by 23 points, with about 60% of the vote.) Suozzi, Curran and others said the special election might be Democrats’ last best hope to stop Long Island’s red tide from surging further, noting Suozzi’s name recognition and personal political brand – a straight-talking, go-everywhere moderate – in comparison with Pilip’s aversion to gladhanding on the trail. Nassau County Legislator Mazi Pilip, seen here with former New York Rep. Peter King, right, arrives to cast her ballot during early voting in Massapequa, New York, on February 9, 2024. Adam Gray/Bloomberg/Getty Images “Here’s someone who has proven that he can fix the problem and wants to fix the problem. But is that what people are looking for right now, or are they just so mad at the Democrats that they’re not listening?” Curran said of Suozzi and district voters. “Honestly, Tom is the one who can win this race – if a Democrat can win it.” Larry Levy, a former local journalist who is now the executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University, offered the same mixed blessing to Suozzi and Nassau County Democrats. “The outcome (of the race) will be a measure of how the Democratic brand can affect races all over the country,” Levy said. “If Suozzi can’t withstand the damage the Democratic Party has sustained over inflation, Israel and immigration, then I’m not sure who could.” In an interview with CNN, Nassau County GOP leader Joe Cairo agreed that Suozzi has a unique brand but said the former mayor, county executive and congressman’s long record in office cuts both ways. “Tom Suozzi on his signs, he’s saying, ‘Let’s fix it.’ Well, who broke it, Tom?” Cairo said. “You were in Congress.” Hot button issues such as the migrant influx, mixed in with the fight over abortion rights and a housing and cost-of-living crisis on Long Island, have driven a special election campaign that has seen the airwaves dominated by ads and mailboxes stuffed, almost daily, with campaign literature from both parties. Though no single contest – much less an almost pop-up special election conducted under unusual circumstances – can claim to foretell what comes next in national politics, “Suozzi vs. Mazi” (it rhymes) comes awfully close. In a nod to the dim views of Democrats and Republicans in this swing district, neither Suozzi nor Pilip advertise their party affiliation on the thousands of lawn signs now staked out across the district. Pilip initially refused to say who she voted for in 2020, before eventually telling the New York Post over the weekend that she “proudly” cast her ballot for Trump. In sum, Nassau County looks a lot like the suburban areas around the country that are expected to play an outsize role in determining the 2024 presidential race. “You’ll hear from Democrats, if they lose, that this really isn’t a bellwether because Nassau County has been an outlier nationally,” Levy said. But, he added, while nothing is certain, “the reality is that the issues are going be the same, whether it’s … Montgomery and Bucks counties in Pennsylvania or Oakland County, Michigan.” What distinguishes Nassau County from some of those other traditional battlegrounds is its proximity to America’s biggest city, where political moods tend to filter out into the suburbs and, in recent years, concerns over public safety and, more recently, a growing migrant housing crisis are dominating the headlines. “We look west and we see what’s happening in New York City, whether it is crime, migration, affordability issues. Even if it’s not here in our backyards, because we live off of New York City, basically,” said Mike Florio, a former top Suozzi staffer in Congress turned CEO of the Long Islanders Builders Institute. “What the Republicans are able to do is tie the issues you see in New York City and say, ‘If you go with the Democrats who control New York City, you know, we can end up like that.’” Some of the asylum-seeking migrants whose presence has scrambled local politics are currently living in a relief center near the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, which sits inside the 3rd District’s borders. During their Thursday night debate, Pilip – as she’s done in commercials and mailers – claimed Suozzi, who represented the district from 2017 to 2023, and Biden were responsible for the mess. (The city’s migrant surge started when Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas began busing people north in 2022.) In this screengrab from video, candidates for New York's 3rd congressional district Mazi Pilip and Tom Suozzi square off at a town hall style debate hosted by News 12’s Rich Barrabi just days before the special election for George Santos’ vacant House seat on Thursday, February 8, 2024. News 12 Long Island Related article Takeaways from the New York special election debate “Tom Suozzi opened the border. Tom Suozzi funded the sanctuary city. Tom Suozzi kicked ICE from Nassau County,” she said, before addressing Suozzi directly: “You have to own it.” For his part, Suozzi has sought to brush off the attacks as absurd. His fight with ICE, he said, came at the behest of a police chief whose officers clashed with ICE agents more than 15 years ago during his time as county executive. The broader thrust of similar attacks, he said early on in the debate, was not credible. “For you to suggest I’m a member of ‘the squad’ is about as believable as you being a member of George Santos’ volleyball team,” Suozzi said to some laughter in the hall. In fact, Suozzi did once express affinity for “squad” members – an informal coteries of House progressives – though not in the context Pilip and other Republicans have described. Suozzi made the remark in 2019, shortly after then-President Trump said Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib – all of whom are American citizens – should “go back” to their countries. “I don’t agree with all the politics of the squad. I’m a Democrat. I don’t agree with a lot of their politics,” he said that summer. “But today, I want to be an honorary member of ‘the squad.’ Because I want to fight against this un-American, racist type of behavior.” Suozzi, too, has sought to lump in Pilip with more divisive characters, including Santos. On Thursday night, he called her “unprepared and unvetted” and then sought, during a tense and protracted exchange, to get her to explain contradictory positions on abortion and gun laws. Pilip says “every woman should have that choice (on abortion) to make their decision” but also calls herself “pro-life.” She opposes both a national ban on abortion and the codification of Roe v. Wade, backing the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision and saying that the issue should be decided at the state level. Pilip has also said “automatic weapons” should be banned – which they are – but does not support a new assault weapons ban, which would outlaw firearms such as the semi-automatic AR-15. Suozzi also zeroed in on Pilip’s rejection of the bipartisan border security deal, hatched in the Senate, as a cop-out to Trump, who denounced it. “We finally have a chance to have a solution,” Suozzi said, “but we’re not going to do it because President Trump said it’ll help Biden?” Nerves, not excitement, among voters On the ground in Nassau County, though, there is less talk about the nitty-gritty of the issues and more of a prevailing dissatisfaction with both parties and their leaders – even a candidate like Suozzi whom they know and mostly like. Jim Fornaro, 66, a local resident and former registered Democrat who once backed Suozzi and still calls him “a great guy,” told CNN on Thursday that he plans to vote for Pilip this week. “A lot of things in the country, in my opinion, aren’t going in the proper direction. So another person who votes with Biden 100%, I don’t look at it,” Fornaro said. “I’m really voting against Suozzi.” Others are planning to sit out the election, bummed over the choices. “Suozzi has shown for a long time who he is – just a bureaucrat. And Mazi, I don’t know,” said Nestor Oginar, a Macedonian-born former professor and Republican who doesn’t intend to vote. “I think she’s a newcomer, so we don’t know what she is. But I think she’s pandering to certain groups of (voters).” Though Santos rarely comes up in conversations with voters, his saga enraged rank-and-file Long Island Democrats, who had previously spent time writing post cards to encourage voters in states like North Carolina. Now, that mail is landing here. Suozzi canvassers Rachel Klein, 44, and Stephanie Visconti, 47, leaders with Engage Long Island, told CNN that Suozzi might not have been their first choice – but the stakes, at home and with the whole country watching, are too steep for hair-splitting. “I hope Democrats have learned like what it’s like to not have representation and how important it is to flip this seat back so that they’ll show up,” Klein said Thursday, after a morning canvassing here and in New Hyde Park. “But I guess we’ll see on Tuesday.” Visconti’s message was similarly pragmatic. “I definitely am left of his center,” she said of Suozzi, but his election to a closely divided Congress would have one main upside for her. “We’d be one step closer to having Hakeem Jeffries be our speaker,” Visconti said, “of flipping and moving forward as a nation.” Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Stephanie Visconti's last name."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/white-house-tiktok-policy-biden-campaign/index.html,"Washington CNN — The White House on Monday said there are no changes regarding the administration’s long-standing security concerns over TikTok after the President Joe Biden made his campaign debut on the platform Sunday night. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday the ban on the platform’s use on government devices “remains the case today.” He referred questions over the video to the president’s reelection campaign, which posted it. “I don’t want to get into too much of the national security, technical reasons behind that, but it does have to do with concerns about the preservation of data and the potential misuse of that data and privacy information by foreign actors,” Kirby told reporters. In a follow-up exchange with Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary said she was not aware the campaign planned to launch a TikTok account ahead of Sunday. “No – I am very, very careful, as the White House press secretary … and so I do not communicate with the campaign on any strategy or anything like that. … I did not know; I knew as you all did,” she said. In the TikTok, which was posted during the Super Bowl matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, Biden answered a series of light-hearted Super Bowl-themed questions. Asked to choose between the game and commercials, Biden picked the game. He responded “Mama Kelce” when asked to choose between Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and his brother, Jason, who plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. Biden jokingly said he would “get in trouble if I told you” when asked whether he rigged the game for the Chiefs, referencing a popular conspiracy theory involving Travis Kelce’s girlfriend, superstar musician Taylor Swift. And in the final round of questioning of “Trump or Biden,” he laughed and replied, “Are you kidding? Biden.” The TikTok debut was just one effort made by the campaign to dip its toes into meme culture and court young voters Sunday night. Following the Chiefs’ 25-22 overtime win, Biden’s campaign posted a “Dark Brandon” meme with the caption: “Just like we drew it up,” referencing the conspiracy theory that the Biden administration worked in tandem with Swift to rig the game and swing the 2024 election in Biden’s favor. But there are security concerns around the popular video app, which is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese technology company. TikTok doesn’t operate in China, but since the Chinese government enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, the theory goes that ByteDance – and thus indirectly, TikTok – could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities, including possibly the transfer of TikTok data. The US government has said it’s worried China could use its national security laws to access the significant amount of personal information that TikTok, like most social media applications, collects from its US users. To date, the US government has provided no specific evidence that the Chinese government has accessed US TikTok user data. TikTok has moved to consolidate US user data on US soil through a program it calls Project Texas. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have been somewhat aligned on their national security concerns pertaining to TikTok. During his administration, Trump threatened to ban the platform if it did not divest from its Chinese owners. In 2022, Biden signed legislation prohibiting TikTok on federal government devices. The Biden campaign will take “advanced safety precautions” with its devices and will incorporate a “sophisticated security protocol to ensure security,” a campaign adviser said, while noting the “campaign’s presence is independent and apart from the ongoing” Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States review into TikTok ."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/jamie-raskin-letter-comer-witness/index.html,"The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, raised serious questions about a key witness in the impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden in a letter to Oversight Chairman James Comer provided first to CNN. Raskin wrote that Tony Bobulinski, a business associate of the Biden family who is expected to be interviewed on Tuesday as part of the Republican-led investigation, presents “giant red flags” and called on Comer to bring in other Trump administration and campaign officials to corroborate any testimony he provides. Bobulinski alleged in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election that Joe Biden profited from his son’s business deals, which former President Donald Trump and his allies seized on. In the letter, Raskin asks Comer to bring in some of those allies for interviews, including Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows, Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann and Trump advisers Arthur Schwartz and Jason Miller. But other witnesses close to Bobulinski and the Biden family have refuted Bobulinski’s claims. Biden business associate Rob Walker told the FBI in 2020 that Bobulinski’s claims about Joe Biden’s involvement was “wishful thinking” and agreed with agents who comparied Bobulinski’s claims to “unicorns and rainbows.” Walker recently testified to House Republicans that Joe Biden “while in office or as a private citizen, was never involved in any business activities we pursued,” according to excerpts of his testimony provided to CNN. Another associate to the Biden family, James Gillar, who was on an email chain Bobulinski was using as evidence, told the Wall Street Journal when Bobulinski’s allegations were made, “I am unaware of any involvement at any time of the former vice president.” Raskin also raised issue with Bobulinski’s lack of cooperation with Democrats on the Oversight Committee, and questioned the materials he turned over as “cherry-picked and selective information.” A House Oversight Committee spokesperson told CNN that Raskin’s concerns about Bobulinski are “beyond parody” and accused Democrats of “engaging in witness intimidation.” CNN has reached out to Bobulinski for response to Raskin’s letter. Comer meanwhile has praised Bobulinski and described him as “of all of the guys that were involved in the Hunter Biden orbit, Tony Bobulinski appears to me to be the one solid guy that tried to do the right thing and was honest.” The committee requested to speak with Bobulinski to learn about what “firsthand knowledge” he had. Raskin’s letter to Comer comes shortly after House Oversight Democrats released a new memo that shows none of the last seven witnesses interviewed as part of Republican’s impeachment inquiry have said there was any evidence of wrongdoing by the president. The report includes excerpts from each interview and offers a serious blow to Republicans who have been struggling to build momentum on their inquiry and openly questioning whether it will result in impeachment. “Each witness stated they were not aware of any evidence of any wrongdoing by President Biden or of President Biden being involved in, profiting from, or taking official actions in relation to family members’ business ventures” the report from Democratic staff reads. “Further, not one of these witnesses indicated they ever had any expectation of receiving or ever did receive any political favors from President Biden or his Administration.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-smith-mar-a-lago-documents-case/index.html,"CNN — The classified documents criminal case against Donald Trump and others is heating up again Monday with crucial hearings over access to evidence that could impact whether the former president is tried before the November election. Trump arrived at the federal courthouse Monday morning in Fort Pierce, Florida, for a closed-door hearing with Judge Aileen Cannon without prosecutors present to discuss the case “in detail.” Trump left the courthouse shortly after 2 p.m. ET, waving to a crowd from his car. Special counsel Jack Smith’s team is scheduled to meet with Cannon Monday afternoon. Neither hearing is open to the public. The defense lawyers will argue for access to classified evidence in the case they or their clients haven’t yet seen – and that prosecutors and intelligence agencies seek to keep from them, potentially giving them only summaries of the information because of how sensitive it is, according to the court record. While many of the Mar-a-Lago documents case proceedings and filings have been kept out of the public’s view in recent weeks, the prosecutors and defense teams have been preparing for trial. The defense teams have been furiously at work over the past several days – including on Super Bowl Sunday – preparing for the hearing Monday, writing motions and reviewing evidence in a sensitive compartmented information facility, called a SCIF, in Florida, according to multiple sources familiar with the team. In addition to the hearing, they face a major deadline for court filings in less than two weeks, as they continue to strategize for ways to delay the trial. They are also fighting with prosecutors over making witness names public now, well before the trial. Court cases with classified evidence such as this require careful oversight by the judge to make sure defense teams can access evidence they need to prepare for trial while protecting the federal government’s national security secrets. That sometimes prompts extended court proceedings to determine which pieces of classified evidence defense lawyers and even defendants can see. In Trump’s case, the complexities of the case, the multiple defendants, and the number of classified records that are part of the evidence could lead to delays. A March 1 hearing with Cannon is expected to address whether the trial can go forward in May as scheduled. The Justice Department previously said what it seeks to keep from Trump’s co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira amounts to at least 5,500 pages – some of which their lawyers, Trump and his defense team already can work through in a SCIF. The records being kept from the co-defendants are largely the documents with classified markings found in boxes at Mar-a-Lago by the FBI in August 2022, according to court filings. Lawyers for Nauta and De Oliveira have argued they should get more access so they can “meaningfully discuss the viability” of their defenses, a matter that is likely to be discussed in the sealed proceeding Monday. A smaller group of records is also being kept from Trump and his lawyers because of the federal government’s national security sensitivities. Cannon has already heard arguments in person from the special counsel’s office once and has seen sworn statements from intelligence agencies on the need to keep some records secret even from the defense teams. At a later date, Cannon will have to decide which pieces of evidence are necessary to use during a public trial and how that information can be presented. Debate over witness safety and delays The tensions in the Mar-a-Lago case extend beyond the defense teams’ access to evidence. The special counsel’s office is seeking to keep secret from the public names of witnesses who could be called to testify against Trump at trial, saying witnesses could be harassed. An aerial view of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate is seen on August 10, 2022, in Palm Beach, Florida. Steve Helber/AP/File Related article Special counsel details threats against witnesses in Mar-a-Lago case in effort to protect their identities Those witnesses include government personnel from the National Archives, more than 20 FBI agents who were at the search of Mar-a-Lago, people who had relationships with Trump and his co-defendants, and other career civil servants. Smith cited myriad threats against judges, prosecutors and witnesses, including one threat toward a witness on social media that is the subject of a federal criminal investigation. Though scant information is public about the closed-door fights between Trump, his co-defendants and the special counsel, the former president has made clear that he believes the drama about discovery and classified information should delay the trial’s scheduled start date in May. Trump’s attempt to delay the trial underpins several of his recent moves in court. Smith made clear his frustration with these attempts, writing in a court filing recently that the defense “will stop at nothing to stall the adjudication of the charges against them by a fair and impartial jury of citizens.” Smith alleged Trump is using a series of legal challenges the former president’s team said they plan to file as part of his efforts to delay the trial. Several major filings are due from the defense on February 22, largely as they attempt to cut out portions of the charges or have the case dismissed. But the defense team wants some of those filings to come in later, saying they will rely on Cannon’s decision over their access to classified records.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/us-out-nato-second-trump-term-former-senior-adviser/index.html,"CNN — As US allies reel from Donald Trump’s weekend comments encouraging Russia to attack European allies if they don’t meet NATO budget contribution goals, multiple former Trump advisers warn in my upcoming book that the former president will seek to formally withdraw the US from the NATO alliance if he wins a second term. In “The Return of Great Powers”, which will be published March 12, a former senior US official, who served in both the Trump and Biden administrations at a high level, told me that if Trump defeats President Joe Biden in November “the US will be out of NATO.” “NATO would be in real jeopardy,” John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, agreed. “I think he would try to get out.” Trump’s disparagement of US security commitments extends to its mutual defense agreements with South Korea and Japan as well, retired General John Kelly, who served as White House chief of staff to Trump, told me. “The point is, he saw absolutely no point in NATO,” Kelly said in the book. “He was just dead set against having troops in South Korea, again, a deterrent force, or having troops in Japan, a deterrent force.” “He thought (Vladimir) Putin was an okay guy and Kim (Jong Un) was an okay guy ­that we had pushed North Korea into a corner,” Kelly recalled. “To him, it was like we were goading these guys. ‘If we didn’t have NATO, then Putin wouldn’t be doing these things.’” Senior members of the administration I spoke to for the book also detailed how Trump came close to withdrawing the US from the alliance, which is a key bedrock of Western security against Russia, in his first term and warn he is likely to go further in a second. “Democrat and media pearl-clutchers seem to have forgotten that we had four years of peace and prosperity under President Trump, but Europe saw death and destruction under Obama-Biden and now more death and destruction under Biden,” Trump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller told CNN. “President Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up, but Joe Biden went back to letting them take advantage of the American taxpayer. When you don’t pay your defense spending you can’t be surprised that you get more war.” Video Ad Feedback White House responds to what Trump said about NATO countries and Russia 01:54 - Source: CNN Trump’s 2018 near NATO exit At the core of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty is the promise of collective defense — that an attack on one member nation is an attack on all the nations in the alliance. Trump has long complained about the amount NATO members spend on defense compared with the US. In “The Return of Great Powers,” multiple advisors recount in detail how Trump very nearly removed the US from NATO at the alliance’s 2018 summit in Brussels. “He was always ranting and raving and jumping up and down, and oftentimes he would spin up in terms of, ‘Well, I’m smarter than they are,’ and all of this,” Kelly said, describing Trump’s mindset in Brussels. Kelly said he tried to explain the importance of NATO to Trump in terms he believed the president would understand. Kelly’s approach involved a combination of explaining what was actually possible and what might make him look bad. In the case of withdrawing from NATO, Kelly tried to convey to Trump that both applied. But at the summit, Trump persisted. A former senior US official told me that Trump issued orders to then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley and then Defense Secretary Mark Esper for the US to withdraw from NATO. Despite vehemently opposing the move. They considered the president’s direction a “lawful order” and drew up plans to execute the withdrawal. Bolton recalls the 2018 summit with genuine fear. “Honest to God, it was frightening because we didn’t know what he was going to do up until the last minute. And I mean, I think, he all but said he was going to get out of NATO and then pulled back on it,” said Bolton. Other potential Trump targets Many veterans of the Trump administration have a similar warning for Ukraine. “US support for Ukraine would end,” said the senior US official who served under Trump and Biden. Noting Trump’s comment at a Fox News town hall in July 2023 claiming, if reelected as president, he could end the war in one day, Bolton said, “If I were Ukraine, I’d be very worried, because if everything is a deal, then ‘what’s another ten percent of Ukrainian territory if it brings peace?’ kind of thing.” US support for Taiwan, they say, would also be in jeopardy. Bolton recalled a stunt Trump would carry out in the Oval Office. “He would hold up the tip of his Sharpie pen and say, ‘That’s Taiwan. See this Resolute Desk, that’s China.’” His point, according to Bolton, is that Taiwan is too small to successfully defend itself against a Chinese invasion— ­ and too small for the US to care. Bolton recalled, “I mean, if I were in Taiwan, I would be very worried about a Trump administration.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/rfk-jr-apologizes-cousins-super-bowl-ad/index.html,"CNN — Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. apologized to members of his family who objected to a new TV ad released Sunday during the Super Bowl that repurposed a spot from his uncle’s 1960 campaign. The retro-themed ad from a PAC backing his candidacy mimics the soundtrack and theme of President John F. Kennedy’s 1960 campaign ad. The spot features a dramatic orchestra opening and a jingle repeating the word “Kennedy” over and over again. The ad also feature the lyrics, “Do you want a man for president who sees it through and through? A man who’s old enough to know and young enough to do.” The words are a potential jab from the 70-year-old Kennedy toward his somewhat older competitors, 81-year-old President Joe Biden and 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, in a race defined by criticisms of age and mental cognition. “My cousin’s Super Bowl ad used our uncle’s faces- and my Mother’s. She would be appalled by his deadly health care views. Respect for science, vaccines, & health care equity were in her DNA,” Kennedy’s cousin Bobby Shriver said on X following the release of the ad. Another of Kennedy’s cousins, Mark Shriver, replied to Bobby Shiver’s post by saying “I agree with my brother @bobbyshriver simple as that.” Bobby and Mark Shriver are sons of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of President Kennedy and the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy responded to criticism from Bobby Shriver by apologizing. “Bobby. I’m so sorry if that advertisement caused you pain. The ad was created and aired by the American Values Superpac without any involvement or approvals from my campaign. Federal rules prohibit Superpacs from consulting with me or my staff. I send you and your family my sincerest apologies. God bless you,” Kennedy posted on X. American Values 2024, the group supporting Kennedy’s presidential bid, spent $7 million on the ad. More recently, the PAC faced allegations from the Democratic National Committee that it illegally contributed to Kennedy’s signature-gathering efforts. Kennedy has faced dissent from members of his family throughout his presidential run. On the day of he announced his intention to run for president as an independent, a group of his siblings called his decision to run against Biden in a general election “dangerous to our country.” Kennedy has been a leading proponent of vaccine misinformation through his Children’s Health Defense organization and has spent years wrongly suggesting that many vaccines are not safe. In a CNN interview in December, he walked back some of his comments and rejected the label that he’s “anti-vaccine” despite his history of spreading misinformation about the efficacy of vaccines. He also made a series of comments in 2022 in which he compared the Covid-19 lockdowns to Nazi Germany, arguing that “even in Hitler’s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland.” “Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment,” Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Joseph P Kennedy II and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a statement in October. CNN’s Liz Brown-Kaiser contributed to this story."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/biden-netanyahu-israel-gaza/index.html,"CNN — President Joe Biden has grown increasingly frustrated behind the scenes with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, telling advisers and others that the prime minister is ignoring his advice and obstructing efforts to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, according to people familiar with the matter. So far, Biden has stopped short of directly criticizing Netanyahu in public. But he has become increasingly critical of Israel’s tactics, saying last week he believes the campaign in Gaza is “over the top,” one of his sharpest condemnations to date of the military effort against Hamas. In private, Biden has been more willing to offer unvarnished thoughts on Netanyahu, including his deep irritation that the Israeli prime minister has not followed through on American recommendations to de-escalate military tactics in Gaza. Some officials now wonder how much longer Biden will withhold public criticism of Netanyahu as the war rages on. The president’s comments last week on Israel’s tactics reflected sentiments he has been voicing behind the scenes for a while, one person familiar with the matter said. US officials had hoped that by January, Israel would have transitioned to a lower-intensity, hyper-localized targeting campaign. The tension between the Biden administration and Netanyahu’s government has only intensified in recent days over Israel’s preparations for a ground incursion into Rafah, where thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled over the course of the war. Video Ad Feedback On GPS: What do Israelis think of the war? 06:14 - Source: CNN US officials have been direct in their conversations with Israeli counterparts that the estimated 1.3 million people currently in Rafah simply “have nowhere to go,” according to a senior administration official. The Biden administration is highly skeptical about whether Netanyahu’s direction to Israel’s military for an “evacuation of the population” out of Rafah before Israel forces go in is even remotely feasible. “We have made very clear that an operation under current conditions is not something that we could envision,” the US official said. In the call, Biden told Netanyahu an operation in Rafah “should not proceed” without ensuring the safety of the more than 1 million people sheltering there, the White House said. Biden has long had his differences with Netanyahu and officials acknowledge their relationship is complex. But in recent days, a series of actions and comments have angered some American officials, who like Biden are losing patience with Netanyahu’s resistance to US advice and recommendations. That includes publicly rejecting as “crazy” a Hamas counter proposal on a deal to release hostages and pause the fighting, even as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in the region to try to advance the agreement. The majority of a 45-minute phone call between Biden and Netanyahu on Sunday was about the hostages deal, according to an official. Biden and his team have also been irritated by Netanyahu’s public rejections of a two-state solution, long a lynchpin of American policy in the region. Biden and Netanyahu, who have known each other for more than four decades, have found themselves frequently at odds, both before the October 7 Hamas attacks and after. Biden has bemoaned Netanyahu’s far-right governing coalition and told donors last year that his counterpart’s political predicament was making it difficult for the prime minister to alter his approach to Gaza. The president is also under pressure from progressive Democrats to do and say more about the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza, including through now-frequent protests at his public events. Still, White House officials have long said the president believes any differences with his counterpart are best aired behind the scenes rather than in public. Biden has made light of his disagreements with Netanyahu, recounting an inscription he wrote on an old photograph of the two men: “Bibi, I love you, but I don’t agree with a damn thing you have to say.” “It’s about the same today,” Biden said in December. Since then, however, frustrations have only mounted over Israel’s military campaign and tactics when it comes to negotiating a deal to secure the release of hostages. Biden offered his Israeli counterpart and the people of Israel his unwavering support in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 attack, even flying to the war zone to show what he said was his and the United States’ unequivocal support for their ally. Netanyahu, meanwhile, offered Biden praise over the weekend as the president was combatting questions about his age and mental acuity. In an interview, the Israeli prime minister said he found Biden “very clear, very focused” when asked about special counsel Robert Hur’s description on Biden as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” In an interview with ABC News, Netanyahu said he’s had over a dozen “extended phone conversations” with Biden. “He also came on a visit to Israel during wartime, which was a historic first, and I found him very clear and very focused,” Netanyahu said. “We managed to agree on the war aims and on many things. Sometimes disagreements, but they weren’t born of a lack of understanding on his part or on my part,” Netanyahu said."

Mark Green joins ""Fox & Friends"" to argue that the special counsel's report on Biden's mental acuity needs to be released and discusses the House's second upcoming attempt to impeach DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The scrutiny aimed at President Biden following the damaging report released last week by Special Counsel Robert Hur has breathed new life into the belief that Democrats will ultimately replace him as the party's nominee ahead of the 2024 general election. In building his argument for why no charges were recommended following an investigation into Biden's mishandling of classified documents, Hur detailed in part that Biden's defense of any potential charges could possibly be that ""Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" The report cited examples when investigators said the president's memory lapsed , including when his older son, Beau, died, and caused heightened concern among Democrats who previously backed the president despite Republican attacks on his ability to serve.

Gavin Newsom Newsom has perhaps been the most mentioned name as a potential presidential nominee, given his outspoken criticism of national Republican figures as well as his high-profile clash with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at a debate hosted by Fox News last year. Democrat strategists and members of the media continually mention him as a future presidential hopeful, but that future could come sooner rather than later should Biden's plans change. Douglas Schoen, a former adviser to President Clinton, wrote in an op-ed last summer that Newsom ""wants to run for president in 2024"" but was backing Biden for reelection to garner support for himself. BIDEN'S MEMORY STRUGGLES COULD IMPERIL NATIONAL SECURITY, DEFENSE EXPERTS WARN: ‘NOT ONLY WEAK BUT CONFUSED’ ""Gavin Newsom wants to run for president in 2024, that much is clear. The California governor would not be campaigning for President Joe Biden in red states with 16 months until the presidential election if he wasn’t trying to prove his own political bona fides and build a future base of national support for himself,"" he wrote. A Washington Post columnist praised Newsom last year for running a ""shadow campaign"" for president, calling it a ""patriotic"" move, although Newsom has denied any such effort. He has, however, undertaken multiple international trips and engaged with foreign leaders. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (Getty Images/File) 2.

More than half of Americans believe President Biden got ""special treatment"" in the special counsel investigation into his mishandling of classified documents, according to a new poll. The Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 53% of Americans believe Biden got off easy because he is president. Roughly 29% of Democrats also agreed Biden got special treatment. The results come after Special Counsel Robert Hur chose not to recommend charges against Biden for mishandling classified documents, in part because Biden could present himself to the jury as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""

Last week, Rep.

The Senate passed a $95 billion national security supplemental package to assist Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific after a tedious procedural process that came to an end early Tuesday morning. The final vote was 70 to 29, with 22 Republicans voting yes. Democratic Sens. Peter Welch and Jeff Merkley, plus independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, voted no. The supplemental package does not include any border security provisions and comes as the national debt soars above $34 trillion. Calls to offset the spending with cuts elsewhere went unheeded. Several Republicans spent hours — since the beginning of the weekend — collectively filibustering the package on the Senate floor. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, committed to filibustering the bill for four hours on Saturday and continued early Tuesday. The package includes $60 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, $9 billion in humanitarian assistance for Gaza and nearly $5 billion for the Indo-Pacific. Democrats brought the package up for a vote after Republicans had blocked the $118 billion package that also included numerous border and immigration provisions — negotiated by a group of bipartisan senators and Biden officials — last Wednesday. U.S. NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER: SEE WHAT AMERICAN TAXPAYERS (YOU) OWE IN REAL TIME The U.S. has already spent more than $100 billion in aid for Ukraine since its war against Russia began in Feb. 2022. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (L), Democrat of New York; and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, pose for a photo before a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., prior to a meeting on July 27, 2023. (Saul Loeb) ""I applaud the bipartisan coalition of Senators who came together to advance this agreement, and I urge the House to move on this with urgency. We cannot afford to wait any longer,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement Tuesday. ""The costs of inaction are rising every day, especially in Ukraine. Already, we are seeing reports of Ukrainian troops running out of ammunition on the front lines as Russian forces continue to attack and Putin continues to dream of subjugating the Ukrainian people. There are those who say American leadership and our alliances and partnerships with countries around the world do not matter. They do. If we do not stand against tyrants who seek to conquer or carve up their neighbors' territory, the consequences for America's national security will be significant."" In a press conference Tuesday morning, Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. praised the package as ""one of the most historic and consequential bills"" to ever pass in the upper chamber. ""The responsibility now falls on Speaker [Mike] Johnson, and House Republicans to approve this bill swiftly,"" Schumer said. ""And I call on speaker Johnson to rise to the occasion to do the right thing."" However, a showdown between the two chambers is on the horizon, as Speaker Johnson, R-La., said in a statement Monday evening the House would not pass the Senate's foreign aid package, but instead draft their own bill with border security provisions included. ""The mandate of national security supplemental legislation was to secure America’s own border before sending additional foreign aid around the world,"" Johnson said. ""It is what the American people demand and deserve. Now, in the absence of having received any single border policy change from the Senate, the House will have to continue to work its own will on these important matters. America deserves better than the Senate’s status quo."" On Monday, a number of GOP senators were optimistic about a breakthrough to have their amendments addressed, primarily focused on stringent border security measures. However, none of the amendments were brought forward for consideration due to neither party agreeing to the list of filed amendments. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, introduced an amendment identical to the House's immigration bill, H.R. 2, which would restore most Trump-era restrictions, hire additional border patrol officers and tighten asylum screenings. SENATE REPUBLICANS PREPARE FOR LONG HAUL IN FIGHT OVER UKRAINE, ISRAEL AID Sen. Rand Paul speaks during the COVID Federal Response Hearing on Capitol Hill on June 16, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Joe Raedle) Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a hawkish figure against continued aid to Ukraine, said on the floor before the final vote on Monday that the bill ""gives the finger to American taxpayers."" ""This bill gives the finger to all of America — this bill is Ukraine first, America last,"" he said. Republican Sens. Roger Marshall, JD Vance, and Josh Hawley were just a few other senators who spoke in opposition to the bill on Monday, continuing the filibuster. Meanwhile, GOP Sens. Mitt Romney and Thom Tillis were just a few who urged their colleagues to ""delay"" no further and pass the package. Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas became emotional in a floor speech in support of the bill. ""I believe in America first, but unfortunately America first means we have to engage in the world,"" Moran said. Which Republicans voted yes on the foreign aid bill? – John Boozman – Shelley Moore Capito – Bill Cassidy – Susan Collins – John Cornyn – Kevin Cramer – Mike Crapo – Joni Ernst – Chuck Grassley – John Hoeven – John Kennedy – Mitch McConnell – Jerry Moran – Lisa Murkowski – James Risch – Mitt Romney – Mike Rounds – Dan Sullivan – John Thune – Thom Tillis – Roger Wicker – Todd Young Democrats brought the package up for a vote after Republicans had blocked the $118 billion package that also included a slew of border and immigration provisions on Wednesday. Republicans had previously said they would not approve funding for Ukraine unless the overwhelmed southern border was secured first. Conservatives joined with some liberal Democrats in shutting down the bill, so Schumer prepared a vote on the $95 billion foreign aid package without the border package as a backup plan.

Negotiators worked for months and last weekend finally released their text. In addition to the foreign aid package, the failed border package included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average.

GARDEN CITY, N.Y. - The polls have closed in New York's 3rd Congressional District, in a closely watched special election for a vacant House seat once held by former Republican Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from the chamber in December. With the GOP hanging on to a razor-thin majority in the House, national Republicans and Democrats have poured big bucks into a race in suburban New York City where immigration and border security , crime, and abortion are top issues, and where the election is seen as a bellwether ahead of the all-but-certain November White House rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump. The Long Island district held for a decade by Democrats was flipped by Santos in the 2022 midterms. But Santos was kicked out of Congress less than a year into his tenure, after he was exposed for lying about his background and indicted for a slew of financial crimes. Former three-term Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, who's running to reclaim his old seat, has repeatedly tied Republican candidate Mazi Pilip to Santos, as well as to former President Donald Trump.

She's George Santos 2.0. It's the exact same nontransparent, phony baloney, just trying to get votes instead of saying what you really think,"" Suozzi charged on the eve of the election. And Suozzi, a former mayor and county executive, argued that Pilip – who is in her second term as a county lawmaker – ""is a far-right wing extremist"" who is ""totally in line with Mike Johnson and Donald Trump ."" NEW YORK SPECIAL ELECTION CANDIDATES CLASH OVER BORDER CRISIS, ABORTION: 'YOU CREATED THIS ISSUE' Pilip, an Ethiopian Jew who fled to Israel at age 12 to escape persecution and who later enlisted and served in the Israeli military before immigrating to the United States, has linked Suozzi to President Biden and blamed him for the migrant crisis. ""You know, he is the one who opened the southern border. He voted with Biden 100% of the time. He supported squad members 90% of the time, he is the one who caused the migrant crisis,"" Philip claimed in a Fox News interview on Sunday. Republican congressional candidate Mazi Pilip holds a campaign event in Franklin Square, New York, on Feb. 12, 2024, on the eve of a special U.S. House election in NY-03. (Fox News - Deirdre Heavey) Suozzi, a centrist and moderate Democrat, has kept his distance from Biden and his party when it comes to immigration. With Republicans currently holding a fragile 219-212 majority in the House – with four vacancies – a pickup by the Democrats would put the GOP's grip on the chamber further in peril. The contest may also offer clues to how top issues like immigration and abortion will impact November's elections. ""Tom Souzzi rolled out the red carpet for illegal immigrants,"" claims a recent TV ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the main super PAC supporting House Republicans. And a commercial from the House Majority PAC, the top super PAC backing House Democrats, charges that ""Mazi Pilip is running on a platform to ban abortion."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Besides campaigning heavily on crime and immigration, Pilip - a former Democrat who argues the party ""left me and many others"" - is also spotlighting the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel as she aims to win voters unhappy with the far-left's criticism of the Jewish State and support for the Palestinians. But her support of Trump - who she has acknowledged she voted for in 2020 - may hurt her with moderate voters who are not fans of the former president. Suozzi - who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2022 rather than seek re-election to the House - is showcasing his support for Israel and a trip he made to the country last year. Republican congressional candidate Mazi Pilip speaks with reporters outside a polling location in Massapequa, New York, on Feb. 13, 2024, amid a  snowstorm during a special Congressional election in NY-03. (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) While Suozzi, a campaign veteran, has welcomed his interactions with reporters, Pilip's public appearances have been carefully managed. The district, which includes a sliver of the outer portion of the New York City borough of Queens, is anchored in neighboring Nassau County. And it's the kind of suburban district where Democrats need to dominate in the 2024 elections as they aim to reclaim the House majority they lost in the 2022 midterms. But while Democrats have performed well in suburban districts in recent cycles, Republicans have a history of coming out on top on New York's Long Island. While Biden carried the current confines of the district by eight points in his 2020 presidential election victory, Santos won the 2022 election for the open House seat by the same margin. Former Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi (center, waving) greets voters outside a polling location on Feb. 13, 2024 in Glen Cove, New York, in a special congressional election in NY-03. (Fox News - Deidre Heavey) The final public opinion polls in the special election suggested that Souzzi was clinging to a slight single-digit edge over Pilip. Turnout is considered key in the outcome of this election. Democrats appeared to enjoy a slight edge in the nine-day early voting period, which ended on Sunday. And a winter snowstorm walloped the District on Tuesday morning, as polls opened. While the treacherous weather passed by early afternoon, it could impact Election Day voter turnout.

A Monday night debate in California between several candidates vying for an open Senate seat included a question about raising the minimum wage to $50, an idea that one Democrat candidate has floated. ""In the Bay Area, I believe it was the United Way that came out with a report that very recently $127,000 for a family of four is just barely enough to get by,"" Democrat Congresswoman Barbara Lee said when asked to defend her previous support of a $50 minimum wage and explain how it would be ""sustainable."" ""Another survey very recently, $104,000; for a family of one, barely enough to get by, low income because of the affordability crisis."" Lee has previously called for a $50 minimum wage, which would amount to around $104,000 per year of income. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour and ranges from $16 to $20 in California. FAST-FOOD PRICES SET TO RISE AT MCDONALD'S, CHIPOTLE AND OTHERS AS CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE HIKE LOOMS Rep. Barbara Lee (Fox News Digital) ""Just do the math. Of course, we have national minimum wages that we need to raise to a living wage,"" Lee continued. ""We’re talking about $20, $25 — fine. But I have got to be focused on what California needs and what the affordability factor is when we calculate this wage."" Former baseball star Steve Garvey, the only Republican on the stage, told the moderators that the minimum wage ""is where it is and should be."" ""If you look at what California has done to fast-food franchises right now, increasing the minimum wage to $20, and what’s going to happen,"" Garvey said. ""That’s going to increase costs for hardworking Californians to go to a franchise to get a Big Mac for $9, it’s going to be $15."" LOS ANGELES DESSERT SHOP ANNOUNCES SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LOCATIONS, CITES COST OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA Rep. Adam Schiff (Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Demand Justice) Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff took issue with Garvey’s statement and said that so many people are living on the street because they are being paid ""poverty wages."" ""Try to find a house anywhere in California when you’re earning minimum wage,"" Schiff told Garvey. ""We have to raise people’s incomes."" SOME GOP LAWMAKERS WANT TO RAISE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE — BUT ONLY FOR VERIFIABLE AMERICAN CITIZENS California Senate candidate Steve Garvey (Steve Garvey) Schiff and fellow Democrat candidate Katie Porter have floated support for minimum wages ranging from $20 to $25 per hour. California passed legislation last fall that will require a $20 per hour minimum wage at all restaurants with at least 60 locations nationwide, though the law includes an exception for restaurants that make and sell their own bread. Several major fast-food franchises, including McDonald’s and Chipotle, have already signaled that prices will have to rise in response to the increased labor costs. MOST ECONOMISTS OPPOSE THE $15 PER HOUR MINIMUM WAGE – HERE'S THE STUNNING REASON WHY As businesses consider passing costs on to consumers, Fat Brands Chair Andy Wiederhorn recently said that ""someone's got to pay"" for the jump in wages. ""The consumers who are voters must have known what they were getting into by promoting this legislation to raise the minimum wage from $15 to $20 and on its way to $25,"" Wiederhorn told Fox Business this month. ""Everyone wants their employees to make more money, but it just costs. And someone's got to pay for it. And the restaurant operators don't have the margin for that. So, prices are going to go up."" Rep. Katie Porter (Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) A 2021 Harvard Business Review study found that raising the minimum wage actually leads to lower compensation for employees. In addition to companies being forced to raise prices, many economists have also warned that companies will be forced to cut jobs, which often ends up disproportionately hurting low-wage income earners, the very group supporters of raising the minimum wage are aiming to help. ""Apologists for the minimum wage routinely claim that increasing it will help low-income workers and have no negative effects,"" E.J. Antoni, a research fellow in regional economics with the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Data Analysis, told FOX Business about raising the minimum wage last year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""They often cite corporate greed as the only reason for relatively low wages in places like the fast-food industry. In reality, raising the minimum wage reduces employment and causes the higher cost of labor to be passed on to customers.

The House has now impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Think of impeachment as an indictment. It’s up to the Senate to act as a ""court"" and judge whether the accused is guilty of the charges in a trial. The impeachment of cabinet officials is rare. The House has now impeached multiple Presidents and federal judges. But only one cabinet secretary prior to Mayorkas. That was Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. Don’t expect anything to start until late February or early March. The House will send the articles of impeachment plus the House ""managers"" over to the Senate to formally begin the trial. SENATE APPROVES $95 BILLION FOREIGN AID BILL ""Impeachment managers"" are House members who serve as prosecutors. They present the findings of the House before the Senate . Senators sit as jurors. There is a bit of a ceremony to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate from the House and for the Senate to receive the articles. In this case, Acting Clerk of the House Kevin McCumber and House Sergeant at Arms William McFarland escort the articles of impeachment and House managers across the Capitol Rotunda to the Senate. The Senate gathers, usually with all senators sitting at their desks. Senate Sergeant at Arms Karen Gibson then receives the House entourage at the Senate door and reads the following proclamation to the Senate. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) ""All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas."" The articles are then presented to the Senate and the managers are introduced. That is all they usually do on the first day of a Senate trial– although FOX was told the Senate might try to squeeze everything into one day. BIDEN’S EXPORT SUSPENSION ON LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS COULD SPIKE YOUR HEAT BILL Under Senate impeachment trial rule III, the body is supposed to wait until the next day to swear-in senators as jurors. But FOX is told that could happen on day one in this instance. According to Senate rules, the trial must begin the day after the Senate receives the articles at 1 pm in the afternoon. Trials are supposed to run Monday through Saturday. We had Saturday sessions in both impeachment trials of former President Trump in 2020 and 2021.

(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) It is unlikely that U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts presides over a possible Mayorkas trial. Senate impeachment rule IV requires the Chief Justice to preside over cases involving the President or Vice President. In this case, it’s likely that Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray (D-Wash.) presides over a Mayorkas tribunal. Now we get to perhaps the most interesting question of all. How much of a trial is there? The Senate cannot immediately bypass a trial. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has announced that Mayorkas' trial will begin later in February. The House has named its 11 impeachment managers. Senators will be sworn in as the jury. Senators can decide to hold a full trial, or potentially, move to dismiss or actually have straight, up or down votes on convicting or exonerating Mayorkas. The Senate could also send the articles to a committee for review.

Senate Republicans will watch very closely if Senate Democrats engineer any vote to short-circuit the trial. The GOP will take note of how multiple vulnerable Democrats facing competitive re-election bids in battleground districts vote. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If they vote to end the trial or clear Mayorkas, Republicans will likely enroll that into their campaigns against those Democratic senators. Keep in mind that FOX polling data revealed that border security was the number one issue facing voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. Republicans will examine the trial-related votes of Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) – if she runs.

""Swapping one leftist for another is a fantasy, solves nothing, excuses Biden’s culpability, and unconstitutionally expands impeachment that someday will bite Republicans,"" McClintock said last week. House China select committee Chairman Mike Gallagher was among the Republicans who voted against impeachment last week.

One accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and the other of having violated ""public trust.""

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is expected to face a House impeachment vote. ""While Secretary Mayorkas was helping a group of Republican and Democratic Senators develop bipartisan solutions to strengthen border security and get needed resources for enforcement, House Republicans have wasted months with this baseless, unconstitutional impeachment,"" the spokesperson said.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate's $95 billion foreign aid package faces an uphill slog against House Republicans, but their Democratic counterparts say it's crucial for maintaining global democracy. ""We are at an existential moment right now for global democracy and either the United States stands up for freedom and democracy around the world or we don't, and we recede back into the netherworld and allow autocrats, dictators, terrorists to take over the world,"" Rep. Dan Goldman , a Democrat from New York, told Fox News on Tuesday. Rep. Dan Goldman, a Democrat from New York, said the House needs to pass a sweeping foreign aid package in order to preserve global democracy and stand up to Iran, Russia and China. Republicans have already launched a fiery opposition to the aid package. (Getty Images) RANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON 'ROUTE' FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS A bipartisan group of senators passed the national security supplemental package after a lengthy overnight session that ended early Tuesday. The final vote was 70-29. The hefty foreign aid package comes as the national debt exceeds $34.2 trillion . It includes billions for Ukraine, Israel and other foreign partners, but omits any border security provisions, something Republicans have fought for since the White House originally requested the supplemental funding package in October. Video WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE Republicans also helped kill an earlier version of the bill , which paired foreign aid with increased border staffing, speedier deportations when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average and other measures. ""Border security was part of the package that essentially was vetoed by the fourth branch of government, Donald Trump, who ordered Speaker Johnson and the MAGA elements both in the House and Senate to kill it,"" Rep. Jamie Raskin told Fox News. Had Republicans ""really wanted that to be part of it and weren't just rhetorical, they would have adopted what the Senate was doing last week,"" the Maryland Democrat added. House Republicans object to the Senate's massive foreign aid package, which doesn't include any spending cuts to offset the $95 billion price tag. Republicans have also lobbied for the inclusion of border security and immigration measures, but led the charge against an earlier version of the bill that offered work permits to asylum recipients and set a threshold for 5,000 daily border crossings before an expedited deportation process would kick in. (Sergio Flores/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ‘HE’S DELUSIONAL': BIDEN'S BORDER COMMENTS SPARK STIFF REBUKE ON CAPITOL HILL FROM SOME LAWMAKERS But Republicans like Rep. Gary Palmer from Alabama said they oppose the 5,000 a day border crossing threshold. ""What they're trying to do is give us a border package that will allow people to continue to come into the country at a rate that, frankly, during the Obama administration, the secretary of Homeland Security said was unsustainable,"" Palmer said. ""Makes no sense."" Customs and Border Protection sources told Fox News there were more than 12,000 migrant encounters on a single day in December, a new record. The surge of migrants has long overwhelmed border towns and is now putting a strain on cities across the nation . House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized the funding package as ""silent on the most pressing issue facing our country."" ""Now, in the absence of having received any single border policy change from the Senate, the House will have to continue to work its own will on these important matters,"" Johnson said in a statement late Monday. ""America deserves better than the Senate’s status quo."" Raskin suggested Democrats could use a discharge petition to bypass Johnson and bring the package to a House vote if necessary. The Senate's foreign aid package includes an additional $60 billion to help Kyiv fight off Russian aggression, plus $9 billion in aid for civilians in conflict areas such as Ukraine and Gaza. (National Police of Ukraine via AP) CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Goldman said the package is meant to address three adversaries the U.S. has who are ""increasingly aligning themselves"" — Iran, Russia and China. The aid package allocates $60 billion in additional funding for Ukraine , which would bring the United States' total contribution to the country's fight against Russian aggression to more than $170 billion since February 2022. It also includes $14 billion for Israel's fight against Hamas , nearly $5 billion for allies in the Indo-Pacific region and $9 billion in humanitarian aid for civilians in Ukraine, Gaza and the West Bank.

But even before it passed early on Tuesday morning, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., signaled it may not even get a vote in his chamber. ""The mandate of national security supplemental legislation was to secure America’s own border before sending additional foreign aid around the world.

SENATE REPUBLICANS PREPARE FOR LONG HAUL IN FIGHT OVER UKRAINE, ISRAEL AID Republicans in the House and Senate had closed ranks and demanded the Biden administration do something about the border crisis before they could support aid to Ukraine, which has become an increasingly polarizing issue within the GOP. But key Republican leaders lambasted the deal soon after it came out, claiming it did not go far enough to stop the flow of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson led House Republicans in insisting that only an executive order by President Biden could fix the crisis.

President Biden's new campaign account garnered more than 67,000 TikTok followers in the first day since joining the Chinese-owned app he banned over national security concerns. The @bidenhq account's following had jumped even higher to nearly 82,000 followers as of Tuesday morning, with more than 681,300 likes. That's still a far cry from Biden's 37.8 million followers on his campaign account on X, formerly Twitter. ""Lol hey guys,"" the first TikTok video on the account, published during the Super Bowl game Sunday, read in the caption. Biden, in khaki slacks and a navy sweater, stood with his hands in his pockets as he was asked a series of questions. Asked ""Chiefs or Niners?,"" Biden responded, ""Two great quarterbacks, hard to decide, but if I didn’t say I was for the Eagles, then I’d be sleeping alone. My wife’s a Philly girl.""

Biden's reelection campaign on Monday defended its new TikTok account as a vital way to boost its appeal with young voters, even as his administration continued to raise security concerns about whether the popular social media app might be sharing user data with China’s communist government. Biden in 2022 signed legislation banning the use of TikTok by the federal government’s nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes. With 150 million U.S. users, TikTok is best known for quick snippets of viral dance routines. But Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., posted on X that Biden’s campaign is ""bragging about using a Chinese spy app even though Biden signed a law banning it on all federal devices."" ""The President’s TikTok debut last night — with more than 5 million views and counting — is proof positive of both our commitment and success in finding new, innovative ways to reach voters in an evolving, fragmented, and increasingly personalized media environment,"" Biden reelection deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty said in a statement Monday. The Biden campaign said it had been mulling establishing a TikTok account for months and had ultimately done so at the urging of youth activists and organizations, who argued that the app was key to reaching young voters. The campaign said it is using a separate cellphone to engage on TikTok in order to isolate using the app from other workstreams and communications, including emails. The campaign said it was taking additional steps but declined to name them, citing security concerns.

Kirby referred most questions about TikTok to the Biden campaign and ducked a more general query about whether it was wise to use the app at all. He said the potential security issues ""have to do with concerns about the preservation of data and potential misuse of that data and privacy information by foreign actors.""

Democrats have overwhelmingly backed President Biden's 2024 re-election. But the damaging report released last week by Special Counsel Robert Hur has breathed new life into the belief that the party will ultimately replace him as nominee ahead of the 2024 general election. From left to right: California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former First Lady Michelle Obama, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, and Vice President Kamala Harris. (Getty Images) Here are five of the top names being mentioned as a potential replacement for Biden should he decide — or is pressured — not to run for a second term: 1. California Gov. Gavin Newsom Democrat strategists and members of the media continually mention him as a future presidential hopeful, but that future could come sooner rather than later should Biden's plans change. 2. Vice President Harris Harris' presidential ambitions have been known since her first unsuccessful run for the White House in 2020, when she failed to gain support over her Democrat primary opponents, including Biden. Despite her low approval rating and frequent gaffes as vice president, she continues to insist she's ""ready to serve"" as commander in chief, if necessary. 3. Former first lady Michelle Obama Obama has been one of the more surprising names floated as a potential replacement for Biden, considering her lack of political experience. But she remains popular to Democrats, and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy keeps floating the possibility. 4. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Despite declining a run for the White House , Whitmer appeared to leave the door open for a future presidential run after her convincing re-election win during the 2022 midterm elections, a year that was expected to be a difficult one for Democrats. 5. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear Beshear has been seen as a rising star within the party given his status as one of the most popular governors in the country, despite being a Democrat leading a red state. That status grew following a big re-election win last year over then-Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who was considered a rising GOP star.

(Screenshot/Biden speech) Feds decline to charge ‘elderly man with poor memory’ Special Counsel Robert Hur described President Biden as a ""sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,"" and said he would bring no criminal charges against the president despite finding evidence he ""willfully"" retained and disclosed classified materials. Despite the lack of an indictment, plenty of people are calling the report highly damning of the president's mental state. Biden could not recall when his son Beau died, or the year he left the vice president's office, in interviews with the special counsel. Hur determined that charges weren't warranted, despite the potential that some documents could have ""risked serious damage to America's national security."" The special counsel ""also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" ""It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him—by then a former president well into his eighties—of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.""

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nato-comments-trigger-fierce-media-european-opposition-how-serious-he,"close Video The media doesn’t allow the public to hear what Trump has to say: Robby Soave Reason senior editor Robby Soave and Democratic strategist Ameshia Cross join ‘MediaBuzz’ to discuss the Supreme Court appearing to tilt towards Trump in the Colorado ballot case. Donald Trump has made some news that is reverberating around the world. It wasn’t him saying – after that incredible Super Bowl comeback by Kansas City – that he signed a law boosting earnings for musicians so Taylor Swift shouldn’t endorse Joe Biden (also ""I like her boyfriend, Travis""). It wasn’t ""we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country, we will rout the Fake News Media, we will Drain the Swamp."" It’s not that he told a South Carolina rally that "" Biden's thugs are still trying to put me in jail on fake charges for crimes that they openly admit that Crooked Joe did. He actually did these crimes"" – while adding ""I’m not looking for anything to happen to this guy."" WHY BIDEN’S ANGER AND DEFENSIVENESS INFLAMED ANXIETY ABOUT HIS MEMORY ISSUES No, it’s about NATO. Trump recalled a conversation with the president ""of a big country,"" who he says asked him if they didn’t increase their defense contribution to the North Atlantic alliance ""and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?"" Sharing his response at the rally, Trump claims he said: ""You didn’t pay. You’re delinquent… No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want."" The idea that Vladimir Putin could do ""whatever the hell they want"" set off alarm bells, not only among foreign policy officials in Europe but in much of the mainstream media here at home. One potential impact would be on Ukraine, with Trump having declined to endorse more military aid to that weakened country, which would allow Russia’s unprovoked invasion to succeed in either keeping its territorial gains along the eastern border or capturing the entire sovereign nation. And yet there is further evidence, as if any were needed, that the GOP is now Trump’s party. Some of the biggest Republican hawks, who staunchly supported NATO in the past, say they have no problem with the former president’s remarks.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images) As the Washington Post points out, Lindsey Graham said when he ran for president in 2016 that Trump’s comments had made Putin a ""very happy man."" On Sunday, the senator said he was ""not worried"" about Trump’s latest remarks ""at all."" Tom Cotton, another leading hawk, said in 2016 that America must ""make sure that we stand by NATO and we stand for countries like Ukraine and Georgia"" who face ""Russian aggression, and recognize Vladimir Putin as the adversary he is."" On Sunday, the senator said NATO countries not paying their full share are ""already encouraging Russian aggression, and President Trump is simply ringing the warning bell."" UKRAINE AID PACKAGE WOULD BE USED TO IMPEACH TRUMP, SEN VANCE WARNS Marco Rubio said in 2018 that Trump went too far by ""questioning the value of the alliance,"" tweeting: ""The end of #NATO would be a dream come true for #Putin."" On Sunday, the senator said he had ""zero"" concerns about Trump’s latest comments and suggested he didn’t mean them: ""We’ve already been through this. ""You would think people would’ve figured it out by now."" And here’s the kicker: Rubio and Graham pushed through a bill barring any president from withdrawing from NATO. I wonder who they might have had in mind?

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Look, I get it. This is how Trump negotiates. During his first term he regularly questioned the value of the NATO alliance as a way of getting some country to keep their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, with some success. It’s an approach he honed as a businessman when he would threaten to walk away from a deal unless certain conditions were met. But when Trump took office with little experience in foreign policy, he was talked out of any withdrawal by such retired generals as Jim Mattis and John Kelly. The New York Times reports this anecdote: ""Soon after former President Donald J. Trump took office, his staff explained how NATO’s mutual defense obligations worked. ""‘You mean, if Russia attacked Lithuania, we would go to war with Russia?’ he responded. ‘That’s crazy.’ Mr. Trump has never believed in the fundamental one-for-all-and-all-for-one concept of the Atlantic alliance."" But Trump has made clear that in a second term he would surround himself with loyalists who would not attempt to stop such decisions. Senior adviser Jason Miller says Biden has reversed Trump’s approach to NATO: ""Democrat and media pearl-clutchers seem to have forgotten that we had four years of peace and prosperity under President Trump, but Europe saw death and destruction under Obama-Biden and now more death and destruction under Biden."" FINLAND CENTER-RIGHT CANDIDATE ALEXANDER STUBB DECLARES PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY WITH NEARLY 52% OF VOTE Much of the media are leading the charge on NATO. CNN’s Christiane Amanpour called Trump’s latest comments ""insane."" It’s also true that top European officials are being quoted on the record as criticizing Trump’s language. They would be irresponsible if they didn’t start plotting a Plan B. European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 28, 2022. (REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo) The crux of the argument is that the alliance created in the wake of World War II has worked well in deterring war and doesn’t need to be fixed. I happen to be in that camp – and the only time the mutual defense pact has been invoked was when our allies aided us after the Sept. 11 attacks.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-bidens-anger-defensiveness-inflamed-anxiety-his-memory-issues,"close Video Jen Psaki hits media coverage of Biden special counsel report: 'Banging your head against the wall' Former WH Press Secretary Jen Psaki hammered the media coverage of the Special Counsel report on President Biden’s handling of classified documents on Sunday. President Biden took a setback and turned it into a debacle. It’s not like it had never occurred to anyone that an 81-year-old president seeking a second term was problematic. There has been a growing debate about whether Biden has the mental acuity and physical stamina for the job. Even a majority of Democrats say in polls that he shouldn’t run again. I have been saying for a couple of years now, every chance I get, that it’s a mistake for the president’s advisers to shield him from the media. It makes him look disengaged. It takes him out of the news cycle. It leaves a void that is filled by Donald Trump . It’s a surrender of the world’s biggest bully pulpit. The guy even turned down a Super Bowl interview for the second straight year, passing up a massive audience. MEDIA BUILDS UP AROUND TAYLOR SWIFT, SUPER BOWL LVIII AS BIDEN SEEKS SWIFT’S ENDORSEMENT What Biden’s inner circle is doing, of course, is protecting him from making gaffes (which he has done his whole life). Instead, he puts out statements, which get little play. Even when the military launched retaliatory airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, the commander-in-chief remained silent. President Biden sits in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Feb. 9, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) My view is that making mistakes is a small price to pay for being on camera, providing video that drives television and the web. Biden may be working hard behind the scenes, but if voters don’t see you out there leading, they will wonder why you vanished – especially with your likely opponent constantly engaging with journalists. Taking a couple of questions from reporters and providing terse answers, often over the roar of a helicopter, just doesn’t cut it. Biden had a tough time on the memory front last week. He spent 30 painful seconds trying to think of ""Hamas"" until a reporter supplied the name. He mixed up Emmanuel Macron and the late Francois Mitterand. Then, telling the same anecdote, he described what German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had told him in 2021, except the leader died four years earlier. Then came the special counsel’s report. The good news – no indictment for mishandling classified documents – was immediately overshadowed by Robert Hur’s description of the president. The most stinging quote: ""a well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" So poor that no jury would convict him. INFIGHTING CONTINUES AT NEW YORK TIMES AS STAFFERS COMPLAIN ABOUT LGBTQ COVERAGE Biden, said Hur, couldn’t remember what years he had served as VP or the year that his son died. The president, Kamala Harris and the White House all said that Hur, originally a Trump appointee, had no business including such gratuitous insults. Attacking the prosecutor is a well-worn tactic, also practiced by the likes of Trump and Bill Clinton. No matter. A special counsel had given an official stamp of approval to public concerns and anxieties about the president’s mental fitness and his staff had no business letting the boss do five hours of interviews on the two days after Hamas massacred Israelis. But this is when Biden made things far, far worse. Privately cursing and furious, according to several media accounts, he decided to hold a rare news conference – the press was given a 20-minute warning – and poured kerosene on the fire. Biden sounded angry, petty and defensive – a ""crotchety grandpa,"" in the words of New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. He expressed outrage: ""There's even a reference that I don't remember when my son died. How dare he raise that?"" Much of the mainstream media, along with many allies in the Democratic Party, had a come-to-Jesus moment last week, realizing President Biden’s memory is a significant problem for the 81-year-old as he seeks re-election. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images) And he turned his ire against the press, by turns combative and mocking. ""I'm well-meaning, and I'm an elderly man, and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been president. I put this country back on its feet,"" Biden said. As for his memory, ""take a look at what I've done since I became president. None of you thought I could pass any of the things I got passed. How'd that happen? You know, I guess I just forgot what was going on."" NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS SUGGEST BIDEN'S MEMORY COULD BE HUGE FACTOR IN FUTURE CRISIS CNN’s M.J. Lee uncorked a long and confrontational question before being cut off by the president: ""While many American people have been watching and they have expressed concerns about your age –"" ""That is your judgment,"" Biden snapped. ""That is your judgment. That is not the judgment of the press."" But it certainly showed up in poll after poll. ""They expressed concerns about your mental acuity,"" Lee said. ""They say that you are too old. Mr. President, in December you told me that you believe there are many other Democrats who could defeat Donald Trump. So why does it have to be you now? What is your answer?"" Former President Donald Trump speaks on Feb. 9, 2024, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. (Spencer Platt) ""Cause I'm the most qualified person in this country to be president of the United States and finish the job I started,"" he shot back. Oh, and he described Egyptian leader Abdel al-Sisi as the president of Mexico. It was a train wreck. His worst traits were on display. What might have been a two-day flap over the report turned into a chaotic melodrama, with reporters shouting to be recognized. This has the feeling of a turning point. Even though the 77-year-old Trump has had his missteps, confusing Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi, Biden seems more frail in the way he walks and talks, but it is too late for the Democrats to change horses now. The president has nine months to convince the country that he’s up to the job. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Footnote : Politico says in a report that ""top party operatives are warning Biden aides that the president cannot retreat in response to the special counsel report that fueled concerns over his age and mental faculties. They say President Joe Biden, having largely [shielded] away from interviews and press conferences, needs to be out in public far more. ""They want to see him engage with the press and voters in the off-script and punchy exchanges he’s been known for in the past, which they believe will help chip away at concerns about the president’s mental acuity. They say that it’s worth the risk of potential slip-ups that could reinforce the image that he’s declining."" Welcome aboard to everyone who thinks Biden should do more media. I wonder if he’ll take the advice.
