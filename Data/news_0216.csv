cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/russia-nuclear-space-weapon-intelligence/index.html,"CNN — Russia is trying to develop a nuclear space weapon that would destroy satellites by creating a massive energy wave when detonated, potentially crippling a vast swath of the commercial and government satellites that the world below depends on to talk on cell phones, pay bills, and surf the internet, according to three sources familiar with the intelligence. These sources gave CNN a more detailed understanding of what Russia is working on – and the threat it could pose – than the US government has previously disclosed . Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, set off a frenzy in Washington on Wednesday when he issued a statement saying his panel “had information concerning a serious national security threat.” By Friday, President Joe Biden had publicly confirmed that Turner was referring to a new Russian nuclear anti-satellite capability — but officials have steadfastly refused to discuss it further, citing the highly classified nature of the intelligence. The weapon is still under development and is not yet in orbit, Biden administration officials have emphasized publicly. But if used, officials say, it would cross a dangerous rubicon in the history of nuclear weapons and could cause extreme disruptions to everyday life in ways that are difficult to predict. This kind of new weapon — known generally by military space experts as a nuclear EMP — would create a pulse of electromagnetic energy and a flood of highly charged particles that would tear through space to disrupt other satellites winging around Earth. Biden on Friday emphasized publicly that there is “no nuclear threat to the people of America or anywhere else in the world with what Russia is doing at the moment.” “Anything that they’re doing and/or they will do relates to satellites and space and damaging those satellites, potentially,” he said. The Defense Department and the intelligence community have tracked Russian efforts to develop a broad range of anti-satellite weapons, including an EMP, for years. And there has been a stream of intelligence reporting in recent months related specifically to Russia’s efforts to develop nuclear-powered anti-satellite capabilities, according to one defense official. But Russia has recently made progress in its efforts to develop a nuclear EMP — a related but far more alarming technology. “Our general knowledge of Russian pursuit of this kind of capability goes back many, many months, if not a few years,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. “But only in recent weeks now has the intelligence community been able to assess with a higher sense of confidence exactly how Russia continues to pursue it.” The intelligence community, Biden said, had “found out there was a capacity to launch a system into space that could theoretically do something that was damaging” but that it “hadn’t happened yet.” “It’s not a new concept and, as a concept, dates back to the late Cold War,” said one US official. But, they said, “the big fear with any eventual EMP device in orbit [is] it might render large portions of particular orbits unusable” by creating a minefield of disabled satellites that “would then prove dangerous to any new satellites we might try to put up to replace or repair the existing satellites.” The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Defense Department and the National Security Council all declined to comment. It was not immediately clear whether the device as designed could impact GPS and nuclear command and control satellites, which operate in a higher orbit than the vast constellation of commercial and government satellites whizzing through low-Earth orbit. Those larger satellites are designed to be impregnable to a nuclear blast, but a former top space official at the Pentagon told CNN that “they could be vulnerable” depending on how close they were to the EMP, how old they are and how big the blast. ‘Last-ditch weapon’ Experts say this kind of weapon could have the potential to wipe out mega constellations of small satellites, like SpaceX’s Starlink, which has been successfully used by Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia. This would almost certainly be “a last-ditch weapon” for Russia, the US official and other sources said — because it would do the same damage to whatever Russian satellites were also in the area. It also remains unclear how well-developed the technology is. Russia has had a number of public debacles with their nuclear technology in recent years. In 2019, seven Russians were killed in a nuclear accident that occurred while Moscow was trying to recover a nuclear-powered cruise missile that had crashed into the White Sea during a failed test. Still, a recent intelligence assessment on Russian progress so alarmed some lawmakers on Capitol Hill that Turner issued an invitation to all members of the House to be read in on the matter. Shortly thereafter, he issued the vague public statement that forced the issue into the public eye. Several sources familiar with the matter said that the exposure of the intelligence was extremely damaging because the source was incredibly sensitive. According to those sources, the intelligence community is now scrambling to figure out how to preserve its access. Biden administration officials contend that if Russia were to field a nuclear EMP, it would be the first-ever violation of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which bans stationing weapons of mass destruction in outer space. “It would be a violation of the Outer Space Treaty to which more than 130 countries have signed up to, including Russia,” Kirby said Thursday, without providing details. Russia has withdrawn from several arms control treaties in recent years, leaving the post-Cold War arms control architecture all but gutted."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/takeaways-fani-willis-testimony-georgia/index.html,"CNN — The Georgia election subversion case against Donald Trump and 14 of his allies took a stunning turn Thursday when two top prosecutors testified under oath about their romantic relationship at a hearing triggered by allegations of self-dealing that have the potential to derail the indictment. The all-day hearing escalated steadily throughout the day, culminating with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis taking the witness stand for a combative brawl with defense attorneys that drew several rebukes from the judge.

Win McNamee/Getty Images Related article Trump’s team facing a new conundrum: How to stay on the trail during a weekslong criminal trial Judge Scott McAfee convened the hearing after some of Trump’s co-defendants surfaced allegations of a relationship between Willis and Nathan Wade, whom she hired in 2021 to join the prosecution team. Trump and his co-defendants want the judge to disqualify Willis’ team from the case – or throw out the charges – because of a possible conflict-of-interest. There was talk of cash exchanging hands from Willis to Wade, where they store their money at home, CashApp usage, and their spending habits – all to get to the question of whether Willis benefitted financially from putting him on her staff. Willis was expected to return Friday to be be cross-examined by district attorney lawyer Anna Cross, but Cross said at the beginning of Friday’s hearing that she did not have any additional questions . The judge said he does not plan to issue a ruling on Friday. Here are takeaways from the hearing that was at times jaw-dropping, awkward and strikingly personal. Willis’ defiant afternoon on the stand What unfolded on Thursday is extremely rare in American courtrooms. The district attorney who has charged Trump with racketeering went under oath to defend her ethics and answer personal questions about her relationship with Wade. The risks could not be greater, and Willis’ credibility is on the line. Video Ad Feedback Erin Burnett on Fani Willis testimony: She tore into Trump's team 01:33 - Source: CNN Things quickly went off the rails. Willis didn’t act much like a traditional witness and was more like a prosecutor, arguing with the defense attorneys, raising objections, making legal arguments and even having exchanges with the judge. She even raised her voice at one point. This led to a few rebukes from McAfee, who urged her and other attorneys in the courtroom to maintain “professionalism” and to not “talk over each other.” Willis repeatedly accused some of the defense attorneys of peddling lies – before and after the judge’s admonishment. “You’ve lied in this. … I think you lied right here,” Willis said to attorney Ashleigh Merchant, pointing to copies of filings that raised accusations of self-dealing and nepotism. ‘I’m not on trial,’ Willis says Willis seized several opportunities to defend herself. The district attorney had fought efforts to make her appear, both in Wade’s ongoing divorce proceedings and in the hearing on Thursday, up until the moment she came into the room to take the stand. She said at the beginning of her testimony that she was “very anxious” to defend herself, “so I ran to the courtroom.” “You think I’m on trial,” Willis said, in her sharpest pushback of the day. “These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020,” she added, pointing toward the table of attorneys representing defendants in the criminal case. “I’m not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.” She later slammed the defense attorneys, calling them “confused” and “intrusive.” “Ms. Merchant’s interests are contrary to democracy, not to mine,” Willis said, attacking the attorney for Trump campaign attorney Michael Roman, who is accused of playing a leading role in the multi-state “fake electors” plot to subvert the Electoral College. When did the relationship start? On the stand, Wade stuck to his earlier claim – in a sworn affidavit submitted to the court – that his romantic relationship with Willis began in early 2022 and that they split travel and vacation expenses. But Robin Bryant-Yeartie, a former friend of Willis and Fulton County employee, contradicted that claim, testifying that she had “no doubt” that the Willis-Wade affair began in late 2019. Notably, that would be before Willis hired Wade to lead the Trump probe in late 2021. Bryant-Yeartie said she observed “hugging, kissing, close affection” between Willis and Wade prior to 2022, when they claimed their romantic relationship began. She also testified that Willis had told her in 2020 and 2021 that she was dating Wade. There was some Clinton-esque parsing of words on whether Wade cheated on his ex-wife by being with Willis. Past filings from Roman’s team salaciously noted that she had been dating “a married man.” Wade testified that his previous marriage was broken since 2015, long before his relationship with Willis began, saying, “My marriage was irretrievably broken” in 2015, and “I was free to have a relationship.” Wade and Willis describe using cash for reimbursements Wade and Willis have offered a simple explanation for why there’s essentially no paper trail to back up his claims they split expenses: Willis used cash. Credit card statements submitted in Wade’s divorce proceedings show he paid for two flights for them in recent years, to San Francisco and Miami. They also took lavish trips to Belize, the Bahamas and some Caribbean cruises. When pressed on whether he paid for Willis’ travel when they vacationed together, Wade said that Willis reimbursed him for a flight “in cash.” Wade said he did not have receipts for all of the times Willis reimbursed him for trips – pushing back against the allegations from the defense side that Willis was essentially getting kickbacks from him in the form of vacations. “I did not deposit the cash in my account,” Wade replied, smirking at times. Defense attorney Craig Gillen, who represents one of the fake electors, grilled Wade on what he would do with the cash reimbursements – in at least one case, thousands of dollars. “You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash?” Gillen shot back, raising his voice slightly. “No sir,” Wade said, to which Gillen replied: “Not a single solitary one?” “Not a one,” Wade responded. Willis: ‘I don’t need anybody to foot my bills’ There was also a dispute over when the relationship ended, and whether it had any impact on the decision to seek the massive RICO indictment against Trump and others in last August. Both said the relationship ended in summer 2023. Willis implied that the physical component ended earlier in the summer, but that the two had a “tough conversation” that fully ended things afterward. Trump lawyer Steven Sadow asked Willis about the breakup, eliciting an answer that revealed sexist remarks that Wade allegedly made to Willis in the past. She said, he “is used to women that, as he told me one time, ‘the only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich.’” She explained that this was a part of their breakup – but it also was a defense to the self-dealing claims against her. “We would have brutal arguments about the fact that ‘I am your equal,’” Willis said. “I don’t need anything from a man – a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back.” Willis added, “I don’t need anybody to foot my bills.” Earlier, Sadow asked Wade during his own testimony whether the two had any “personal relationship at all” since their relationship ended, saying “and you know what I mean by that.” Wade shot back, asking if Sadow meant “if I had intercourse with the district attorney.” “We’re very good friends, probably closer than ever because of these attacks,” Wade said. “But if you’re asking me about specific intercourse, the answer is no.” Huge distraction from the charges against Trump – for now Nothing that happened Thursday undercut the factual allegations against Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, or the other GOP allies who are accused of trying to overturn the 2020 election. But the hearing shifted the conversation away from those allegation and away from Trump’s legal woes for now. Earlier in the day, a New York judge set the trial date for Trump’s historic first trial, in the hush-money criminal case, for March 25. But by the afternoon, that news was nearly washed away by the jaw-dropping testimony taking place in Atlanta and being beamed across the country on national television. (Unlike the New York case, cameras are allowed in Georgia courtrooms.) Friday, a separate New York judge is expected to issue his decision in the Trump civil fraud case that’s an existential threat to his business. State prosecutors want that judge to issue a $370 million fine against Trump, after finding that Trump and his company committed significant fraud against banks and insurers by lying about his net worth and assets. They also want Trump barred from doing business in New York. This story has been updated with additional developments.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/biden-east-palestine-visit/index.html,"Washington CNN — The Norfolk Southern train derailment that sent toxins into the soil, water and air of East Palestine, Ohio, was an “act of greed,” President Joe Biden said Friday as he visited the town for the first time. Describing the crash as “an act of cruelty that was 100% preventable,” Biden said the administration had been pushing railroad companies to take more precautions prior to the February 3, 2023, Norfolk Southern derailment. “Multibillion dollar railroad companies transporting toxic chemical have a responsibility to do it safely,” Biden said Friday. Norfolk Southern, he said, “failed.” “While there are acts of God,” Biden said, “this was an act of greed.” While nobody was killed in the Norfolk Southern crash, the train’s derailment and the later decision to vent and burn five tankers containing cancer-causing vinyl chloride created a plume of toxic smoke that could be seen from space and caused a panic over the quality of the town’s drinking water. More than 1 million pounds of toxins were put into the town’s water, air and soil as a result of the derailment and its aftermath. Hundreds of residents were ordered to evacuate. Some moved away permanently. Others said they had developed rashes, sore throats, nausea and headaches after eventually returning to their homes, and worried the symptoms were related to chemicals released after the derailment. Biden had been under pressure to visit East Palestine since the derailment. The White House said shortly after the train’s derailment that the president would find a time to visit, but that did not happen last year. Former President Donald Trump visited East Palestine about three weeks after the derailment on February 22, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg visited the next day . Trump during his visit criticized Biden’s absence and what resulted was a political uproar, all while residents said they simply wanted to know whether their water was safe to drink. In the town on Friday, both Biden and Environmental Protection Administration Administrator Michael Regan sought to reassure residents that the administration’s focus was on helping clean the town up and hold Norfolk Southern accountable from the crash since the outset - including Biden’s signing of an executive order in September ordering federal agencies to hold the company responsible for cleaning up the mess and reporting progress. The company reported last summer that costs associated with the cleanup were around $1 billion. While visiting with East Palestine residents, Biden drank local tap water and sipped on coffee that was brewed with the tap water and local beans, according to the traveling press pool. He also announced his administration was awarding six National Institutes of Health grants to research the short- and long-term effects of the derailment. Biden’s visit comes at the invitation of East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway and other community leaders, according to the White House. Conaway has been critical of Biden’s failure to visit East Palestine sooner, telling Fox News last month: “My personal opinion is the best time for him to come would be February of 2025, when he is on his book tour.” Speaking after Biden and Regan, Conaway on Friday said the president’s visit was “long awaited.” East Palestine, Conaway said, will “not be defined by this single event – rather our response to it and our perseverance.” “President Biden, your long-awaited visit to our village today allows us to focus on the things we agree with, acknowledge this disaster should never happen, address the long-term health concerns and the economic growth of the village and ensure this never happens again to another community,” Conaway said. The White House said the president would visit East Palestine to “meet with residents impacted by the Norfolk Southern train derailment and assess the progress that his Administration has helped deliver in coordination with state and local leaders to protect the community and hold Norfolk Southern accountable.” “He also has heard loud and clear from the folks in East Palestine that they don’t want to be defined by an event,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier this week. “And so, he’ll speak to the administration’s work to deliver on the needs for family businesses that are affected.” Biden echoed that message on Friday, promising his administration would stick with its efforts to help the town recover. “It doesn’t matter if you’re Democrat or Republican or independent. What matters is we’re all Americans, everyone, everyone, we look out for one another. We leave no one behind and we come back stronger than before. That’s what you’re doing here. That’s what’s happening right here in this community,” Biden said. “A vast majority has been done. But we’re gonna stay to the very end until every deed is met.” Buttigieg said last month efforts to address rail safety have been stymied by Republicans in Congress. “Almost one year after the Norfolk Southern derailment, Congress has still not passed the bipartisan Railway Safety Act,” he said. “It should not be the case that one year after that derailment, we are still waiting for Congress to act, and yet we have seen many who had a lot to say about this in Congress a year ago still not make clear on the record whether they are for or against this bill, and we’ve seen some House Republicans who have now voted twice to pass legislation that would cut railroad safety fund funding and track inspections.” But Buttigieg previously acknowledged some mistakes in his own response, saying he should have visited East Palestine sooner and that he failed to anticipate the political fallout from the derailment. The Environmental Protection Agency has overseen the removal of more than 174,000 tons of contaminated soil from the site, but questions about whether toxins still lurk remain. Regan told reporters last month that his agency was confident “the residents of East Palestine are not at risk from impacted surface water, soil or air from the derailment.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

Matt Gaetz has subpoenaed his ex-girlfriend who was a key witness in the federal investigation into the Florida lawmaker, according to her lawyer Tim Jansen. She is scheduled to testify, via a video call, on February 29, and Jansen said she will invoke the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The woman, a former Capitol Hill staffer, has been linked to Gaetz as far back as the summer of 2017 . Investigators were interested in that time frame because that is when the congressman is accused of having sexual contact with another woman, who was 17 years old at the time. CNN has reached out to Gaetz for comment on the subpoena, which was f irst reported by ABC News. A spokesperson for the House Ethics Committee declined to comment on the matter. The ex-girlfriend was granted immunity in the federal criminal probe and testified before a grand jury in January 2022. That federal probe concluded in 2023 with no charges brought against the congressman. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/takeaways-donald-trump-fraud-ruling/index.html,"CNN — Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties. Combined with the $83 million judgment issued against Trump for defaming E. Jean Carroll, that means Trump has been fined roughly $438 million over the past four weeks. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 11: Former U.S. President Donald Trump sits in New York State Supreme Court during his civil fraud trial on January 11, 2024 in New York City.

Santiago/Getty Images) Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/File Related live-story Judge orders Trump to pay nearly $355 million in civil fraud trial Friday’s ruling underscored how the civil cases against Trump are still significantly damaging to the former president, endangering his business empire even as he faces four criminal trials, the first of which is set to begin next month. Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again. “Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants. Here’s what to know from the decision: Engoron’s fines are the biggest yet against Trump The fines Engoron levied in his ruling against Trump – known as “disgorgement,” or the return of ill-gotten gains – are higher in terms of magnitude than any previous fine levied against the former president and his company. New York Attorney General Letitia James had asked Engoron to fine Trump and other defendants $370 million, accusing them of engaging in a long-running fraud scheme of inflating Trump’s assets on his financial statements. It came pretty close. Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. Judge Engoron and former President Donald Trump. Pool Related article READ: Ruling ordering Trump and his companies to pay nearly $355M in New York civil fraud case Engoron ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, a contract the judge says “was obtained through the use of false SFC (statements of financial condition).” And the judge ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments, which could potentially add as much as $100 million to the total he’s ultimately required to pay. In addition, Trump was barred from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or other legal entity in New York for a period of three years. Engoron gets the last word, and then some Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. “Defendants’ refusal to admit error – indeed, to continue it, according to the Independent Monitor – constrains this Court to conclude that they will engage in it going forward unless judicially restrained,” Engoron wrote. Engoron acknowledged that the sins Trump committed – which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company – were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. “This is a venial sin, not a mortal sin. Defendants did not commit murder or arson. They did not rob a bank at gunpoint. Donald Trump is not Bernard Madoff. Yet, defendants are incapable of admitting the error of their ways. Instead, they adopt a ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil’ posture that the evidence belies,” the judge wrote. Engoron even turned to poetry to make his point: “The English poet Alexander Pope (1688-1744) first declared, ‘To err is human, to forgive is divine.’ Defendants apparently are of a different mind.” Engoron was critical of Trump’s testimony on the stand, when the former president mostly ignored questions and took the opportunity instead to give political speeches attacking the case, the attorney general and the judge. At first, Engoron tried to rein Trump in – even threatening to remove him as a witness at one point – but he eventually gave up and let Trump rant in response to the questions from the attorney general’s lawyer. “Overall, Donald Trump rarely responded to the questions asked, and he frequently interjected long, irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond the scope of the trial,” Engoron wrote. “His refusal to answer the questions directly, or in some cases, at all, severely compromised his credibility.” No corporate death penalty as judge backs off dissolving Trump Org. Believe it or not, it could have been worse for Trump. The judge banned him from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. In September, Engoron issued a summary judgment dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But he pulled back from that decision – which had been put on hold pending appeal – on Friday, writing that he no longer felt it was necessary because he was putting in place two different independent monitors to oversee the company going forward. The independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years, Engoron ruled. In addition, he ordered an independent director of compliance should be installed at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense. “As going forward there will be two-tiered oversight, an Independent Monitor and an Independent Director of Compliance, of the major activities that could lead to fraud, cancellation of the business licenses is no longer necessary,” Engoron wrote. Trump’s former lawyer and fixer ‘told the truth’ Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen. “Although the animosity between the witness and the defendant is palpable, providing Cohen with an incentive to lie, the Court found his testimony credible, based on the relaxed manner in which he testified, the general plausibility of his statements, and, most importantly, the way his testimony was corroborated by other trial evidence,” Engoron wrote. Engoron pushed back on Trump’s narrative that Cohen was a star witness for the attorney general on whose credibility the case could teeter. “Michael Cohen was an important witness on behalf of the plaintiff, although hardly the linchpin that defendants have attempted to portray him to be,” Engoron said. While the testimony from Trump’s former fixer was compromised by his previous perjury plea in another case and some “seeming contradictions” in what he said at this trial, the judge said he believed Cohen when he testified that “Trump did not expressly direct him to reverse engineer financial statements, he ordered him to do so indirectly, in his ‘mob voice.’” “A less-forgiving factfinder might have concluded differently, might not have believed a single word of a convicted perjurer,” Engoron also wrote. “This factfinder does not believe that pleading guilty to perjury means that you can never tell the truth. Michael Cohen told the truth.” Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company that also hasn’t filled the chief financial officer or controller positions vacated by former Trump Org. execs Allen Weisselberg and Jeff McConney. During closing arguments last month, Engoron questioned whether the attorney general presented any evidence that Trump’s eldest sons knew that there was fraud going on at the company — but ultimately found them liable for issuing false financial statements, falsifying business records and conspiracy claims. “They also served as co-executives running the company from January 2017 to today, in which they had intimate knowledge of the Trump Organization’s business, assets, and were provided with financial updates upon request,” Engoron wrote Friday. The judge knocked Eric Trump’s credibility in his ruling, pointing out inconsistent testimony he gave at trial. “Eric Trump’s credibility was severely damaged when he repeatedly denied knowing that his father ever even compiled an SFC that valued his assets and showed his net worth ‘until this case came into fruition.’” He “begrudgingly” conceded at trial that he actually knew about his father’s statements as early as 2013 “upon being confronted with copious documentary evidence conclusively demonstrating otherwise,” the judge wrote. Engoron also said Eric Trump unconvincingly tried to distance himself from some appraisals of Trump Org. properties that offered a much lower valuation than reported on Donald Trump’s financial statements. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. were both ordered to pay more than $4 million in disgorgement, or “ill-gotten” profits, they personally received from the 2022 sale of Trump’s hotel at the Old Post Office building in Washington DC. Ivanka Trump gets to keep her profits on the building sale because she was dismissed as a defendant in the case by an appeals court ahead of trial. But that didn’t stop Engoron from weighing in on her trial testimony, calling it “suspect.” “Ivanka Trump was a thoughtful, articulate, and poised witness, but the Court found her inconsistent recall, depending on whether she was questioned by OAG or the defense, suspect,” Engoron wrote. “In any event, what Ms. Trump cannot recall is memorialized in contemporaneous emails and documents; in the absence of her memory, the documents speak for themselves.” Next steps: Trump will appeal the ruling Trump’s attorneys have already appealed Engoron’s summary judgment last year that found the former president liable for fraud – and Trump’s attorneys are already planning to appeal this decision, too. Trump attorney Christopher Kise responded to Engoron’s ruling in a statement on Friday, saying the court “ignored the law, ignored the facts.” Kise added Trump will appeal and “remains confident the Appellate Division will ultimately correct the innumerable and catastrophic errors made.” During the 11-week trial, Trump’s attorneys repeatedly criticized Engoron’s handling of the case and raised objections “for the record” and a potential appeal. Engoron often acknowledged the likelihood of an appeal during the trial, raising his concerns with a reversal with the attorney general’s lawyers when he allowed the testimony of certain witnesses the AG objected to as part of Trump’s defense. The reality is that the ruling is likely to be tied up in the courts on appeal for a long time, and Engoron’s ruling Friday was written with an eye toward surviving an appellate challenge.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/republicans-biden-impeachment-fbi-informant/index.html,"CNN — House Republicans leading the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden tried to downplay the importance of an FBI informant whose claims they once championed after he was charged with fabricating foreign bribery allegations involving the president and his son. Special counsel David Weiss charged the FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, with lying to the FBI and creating false records. According to the indictment, Smirnov “fabricated” a story about a Ukrainian oligarch paying millions of dollars in bribes to the Bidens – allegations that Republicans have made central to their impeachment inquiry into Biden. The informant’s uncorroborated – and now fully discredited – claims were memorialized in an internal FBI memo that Republicans fought for months to obtain from the FBI and eventually made public in July over the bureau’s objections. The downplaying of the bombshell charges undermine how Republicans have previously championed the discredited allegations as part of their investigation struggling to uncover wrongdoing by the president. While a spokesman for House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan told CNN “nothing has changed” in the wake of the charges, Jordan said on Fox last month “the most corroborating evidence we have is that 1023 form from this highly credible confidential human source.” House Oversight Chair James Comer said his work is “not reliant” on the now-debunked allegations and pointed to a “large record of evidence,” but when Republicans were fighting to publicize the document that memorialized these claims, Comer said on Fox in May 2023 “this is a very crucial piece of our investigation.” And House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith, who is leading the inquiry with Jordan and Comer, said the allegations were a “smoking gun.” The “fabrications” and “false derogatory information” the informant is charged with further chip away at the broader Republican narrative that as vice president, Joe Biden corruptly abused his powers to pressure Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor who was investigating Ukrainian energy company Burisma as a way to protect his son Hunter, who served on the firm’s board at the time. Even though those charges are largely based on already debunked claims about Biden’s dealings in Ukraine that emerged during Donald Trump’s first impeachment, Jordan has said this is “the key thing” to their impeachment inquiry. The indictment is just the latest setback to House Republicans who are struggling to build momentum to impeach the president. A growing number of Republicans have said it is unlikely their monthslong investigation will ultimately lead to impeachment, given not enough are convinced there is sufficient evidence to do so. In their razor-thin majority , Republicans narrowly squeaked by their effort to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas by one vote after failing to do so the first time, and sources say there are approximately 20 House Republicans who at this point would not vote to impeach the president. In the wake of the charges, President Joe Biden called out the informant for lying and said Republicans should end their impeachment inquiry. “He is lying, and it should be dropped. And it’s just been an outrageous effort from the beginning,” the president said. Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said this in the wake of the charges: “I formally call on Speaker Johnson, Chairman Comer, and House Republicans to stop promoting this nonsense and end their doomed impeachment inquiry.” Republicans leading the inquiry, however, say they have a mountain of evidence, including witness testimony and bank records, to withstand the recent indictment and criticisms about their investigation. The House Judiciary Committee released the transcript of their interview with former US Attorney Scott Brady on Friday, which had occurred in October. CNN previously reported Brady vetted the unverified claims from Smirnov and testified that he found some of the material credible enough to pass the tip along to the prosecutor leading the Hunter Biden criminal probe. “This was a CHS (confidential human source) that was known to the FBI, was credible, had been used – had provided information that was used in other investigations,” Brady said of Smirnov in the interview. Comer’s committee separately released the transcript of the interview with Hunter Biden’s business associate Tony Bobulinski the day after the announcement of the charges against the FBI informant. In the wake of the charges, Republicans have seized on the idea that Smirnov was initially presented as a credible witness. “When asked by the committee about their confidence in the confidential human source, the FBI told the committee the confidential human source was credible and trusted, had worked with the FBI for over a decade, and had been paid six figures. The FBI’s actions in this matter are very concerning,” Comer said Thursday. In the indictment, the FBI said they had used Smirnov “in various criminal investigations” dating back as early as 2010. When fighting to keep the FBI document memorializing Smirnov’s claims private last year, the FBI wrote to Congress that confidential human sources like Smirnov were “valuable.” The FBI told lawmakers during closed-door briefings that Smirnov, then an anonymous confidential human source, was credible. Raskin said after a briefing with the FBI last year, “There is a confidential human source that the FBI works with who is proven to be very credible who reported a conversation with someone else.” And looking forward, top Republicans point to a pair of high-stakes depositions later this month with Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James, as a key next step of their probe and say they are not expected to make an official decision on whether to pursue impeachment articles until those are complete. But even before the charges were announced, lawmakers have been raising questions about the rest of the evidence produced by the investigation. In a recent meeting Republican committee staff leading the impeachment inquiry had with a group of GOP lawmakers, two GOP lawmakers told CNN they did not think investigators presented evidence that amounted to a smoking gun or a specific law that had been broken by the president. Instead, the lawmakers said, the investigators presented various scenarios they believed could lead to criminal wrongdoing. An Oversight Committee spokesperson pushed back: “The purpose of these updates is not to advise members on criminal laws.” And another GOP source countered the lawmakers’ characterization and said staff presented evidence of bribery, money laundering, conspiracy and obstruction. The committee is expected to issue a final report that will address criminal violations at the end of their investigation, the Oversight Committee spokesperson added.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/joe-manchin-president/index.html,"CNN — West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin announced Friday that he will not mount a 2024 campaign for president. “I will not be seeking a third-party run. I will not be involved in a presidential run,” the retiring Democratic senator said in a speech at West Virginia University in Morgantown. Manchin has been on a national listening tour as he weighed jumping in as a third-party presidential candidate , potentially on the No Labels ticket. He has criticized President Joe Biden for being too liberal but also said that he would refuse to be part of any effort that would help Donald Trump return to the White House. Manchin had previously set a deadline of this spring to make a decision, but he is pulling the plug now to instead focus on a new group, Americans Together, which promotes moderate politics. Manchin, a centrist, has found himself at odds with members of his party throughout his congressional tenure, which began in 2010 after he won a special election for a vacant Senate seat. While he helped Biden notch some key legislative wins in the first half of his presidency, Manchin has also been an outspoken critic of the president – especially on issues such as the environment, energy and the economy.

Vasily Maximov/AFP via Getty Images Related article Navalny’s death puts a new spotlight on key dividing line between Trump and Biden In his speech Friday, Manchin torched both parties, though Republicans in Washington and Trump got more of his ire. He ripped into the collapse of the bipartisan border deal last week amid a torrent of attacks on the legislation by top House Republicans and Trump, who has made the border a central campaign issue in his presidential bid. “So many good friends of mine, so many people I thought were there to do the right thing, they cowered to former President Donald Trump’s request not to fix the border,” Manchin said. “As guilty as Joe Biden is for letting it happen, Donald Trump is ten times worse for not letting us fix it.” Manchin said Washington needs to move on commonsense ideas that are widely popular in the country, including codifying abortion rights that had been protected by Roe v. Wade, eliminating the national debt and more gun safety. On the last point, he invoked the recent shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl celebration rally as the latest example of how much gun laws need more of an update. “I’m not trying to ban anything. I’m just trying to make sure that responsible people know how to use guns responsibly. And that certain guns shouldn’t be in the hands of people. That’s just common sense,” Manchin said. He also scolded liberal Democrats for trying to push too many cultural changes on the country. “You’re not going to make me accept things I don’t believe in. But on the other side, I’m not going to let you criticize and ostracize something for what they believe in,” the senator said. Manchin accused the Democratic Party of restricting competitiveness, pointing to presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ’s trouble getting taken seriously at party events. “If a person whose last name is Kennedy … can’t even participate in the Democratic Party in today’s world,” Manchin said, “it tells you the system is broken. The system is controlled and broken.” Kennedy launched a Democratic primary challenge to Biden last spring but switched to an independent run in October. West Virginia Sen.

So was Larry Hogan, the Republican former governor of Maryland. But in one measure of where things stand with the group, in addition to Manchin’s decision, Hogan opted for a Senate run in the Old Line State last week. “No Labels has spent 14 years working to create a movement for America’s commonsense majority and we welcome Senator Manchin’s efforts to strengthen it,” group leaders said in a statement Friday responding to Manchin’s announcement. The statement added that the group was speaking “with several exceptional leaders” and “will announce in the coming weeks whether we will offer our line to a Unity ticket.” Group officials have told CNN and others that their deadline is mid-March. But with weeks to go, the group has still not said anything about who will make the decision, or how. Not a ‘Washington Democrat’ Manchin announced in November that he would not seek a third full Senate term this fall, dealing a blow to Democratic chances of maintaining their narrow majority in the chamber. In an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins in November, he wouldn’t rule out a departure from his party. “I’ve never considered myself a Washington Democrat. I’ve been a very independent person,” he said when asked if he would leave the party. He told Collins he would not want to play “spoiler” in a potential Biden-Trump rematch. But he said another Trump presidency would be a threat to the country: “I think we lose democracy as we know it” if Trump wins a second term, “because he has no regard whatsoever for the rule of law.” Over the past several months, Manchin has made public stops in states such as New Hampshire, South Carolina and Georgia, saying he believed there’s a role for him as a national icon in the “fiscally responsible and socially compassionate” middle, comparable with the role Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders plays for the progressive left. Polls have shown that both Biden and Trump remain unpopular nationwide. A recent CNN/SSRS survey found that 59% of Americans held an unfavorable view of Biden, and 55% felt the same way about Trump. But while polling consistently shows that the idea of a third-party or independent candidate for president is popular, in reality, third-party bids rarely generate as much support as pre-election polling would suggest.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/trump-legal-drama-complications/index.html,"Washington CNN — Every day, America gets dragged deeper into Donald Trump’s legal, political and constitutional morass. This plight was exacerbated by a day of raw drama Thursday in a handful of cities, in multiple cases involving defiant personalities often trading personal smears that tightened the fateful knot between the 2024 election and the ex-president’s staggering legal battle. By nightfall, new truths had emerged about Trump’s fight for his fortune and political career and looming months certain to leave the nation even more estranged, especially as millions of his supporters believe his claims of political persecution. A judge in New York dismissed the last obstacle to the first-ever criminal trial of a former president. Jury selection will begin on March 25 in Trump’s hush money trial. A guilty verdict could mean this year’s potential GOP nominee will be a convicted felon. But if he’s found innocent by a jury of his peers it could also transform the election. The ex-president’s election interference case in Georgia is on a knife-edge after an head-spinning day when two prosecutors were effectively put on trial themselves over a romantic relationship that defendants say should disqualify them and end the case. Even if they survive, Trump and his co-accused may have won the day after taking the chance to malign the prosecutors and to brand them as corrupt and unethical. Trump’s lawyers made a final, beseeching plea to the Supreme Court to stop the clock in a federal trial over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Justices must now decide whether to take up one of the most profound cases in the body’s history. A special counsel charged a former informant with lying about the Biden family’s role in Ukraine, potentially dealing a massive blow to vital testimony Republicans have used to justify an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. Trump is braced for a potentially devastating outcome to a civil fraud trial as soon as Friday. A huge slice of the ex-president’s fortune is at risk along with his capacity to do business in the city where he built skyscrapers and his art of the deal mythology. The ex-president has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing in all cases. But at the end of a tempestuous day, his legal strategy was clearer than ever. First, seek to delay any trials or potential convictions until after the election. Second, allege criminality by those who are calling him to account. Trump’s last resort is a coordinated effort to impugn prosecutors, judges and courts to hedge against any possible guilty verdicts and to destroy their credibility among undecided voters. Video Ad Feedback Michael Cohen, set to testify, weighs in on Trump criminal case 01:58 - Source: CNN Gripping and humiliating testimony in Georgia Everything involving Trump devolves into a circus. So, it was in keeping with the times that the confirmation that a former commander-in-chief will face a criminal trial for the first time ever ended up being overshadowed. The distraction was a televised courtroom battle over claims by Trump and co-defendants that Fulton Country, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and a special prosecutor she appointed accrued financial gain during a romance. One of Trump’s co-accused, Michael Roman, has called for Willis to be dismissed and for the case to be thrown out, alleging that she and special prosecutor Nathan Wade, with whom she had a previous relationship, are conflicted. The stakes are enormous. If Willis is dismissed, the case will be sent to a jurisdiction outside Fulton County – a process that could take months, change the nature of the prosecution and certainly delay it until after November’s election. Like the New York hush money prosecution, the Georgia case is significant because as a state matter it is outside Trump’s potential capacity to halt if he wins the White House. And presidential pardon powers do not extend to such cases. “This case never ceases to amaze me,” Darryl Cohen, a former assistant district attorney in Fulton County who knew key figures in the case, told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “I watched Fani walk into that courtroom, she was walking in hot. … I thought we were watching a heavyweight fight,” Cohen said. “The bottom line is does it matter? Does this take anything away from the facts of the case? My answer is, it does not. It is a sideshow that has legs for the moment.” In dramatic testimony, Willis denied she had benefited from thousands of dollars in taxpayer funds paid to Wade him while the then-couple were on lavish vacations and on cruises. She said she reimbursed him in cash for travel expenses, saying that was a practice she learned from her father. This also explained why there was no paper trail for the transactions. The burden is on the defense to show Willis and Wade erred. It was not clear at the end of a day of intense exchanges that any of the lawyers arrayed against her had proved any evidence of corruption. Similarly, it would be hard to argue that any of the details that emerged prejudiced the capacity of Trump and his co-defendants in the vast racketeering case to get a fair trial. That leaves the ethical conduct of Willis and Wade, and the perceptions that they faced a conflict of interest. One legal analyst, defense attorney Caroline Polisi, argued that testimony from Robin Yeartie – a former co-worker and friend of Willis – that the relationship started well before the 2022 date named by both the district attorney and Wade could mean they had mislead the court. “An attorney lying to the court is not good,” Polisi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Several other observers, however, warned that Yeartie, as a disgruntled former employee, did not come across as a credible witness. But even if Willis and Wade are not disqualified, Thursday’s hearing – in which both were forced to answer humiliating questions on television about their sex lives and claims they were guilty of severe misconduct – served Trump’s purposes in seeking to taint their reputations and potential credibility ahead of a trial. The hearing, which was on television for hours, may have even influenced a future jury pool and Yeartie’s testimony is likely to fuel days of conservative media accounts. And as Willis pointed out, the spectacle had the impact of taking the focus away from Trump and his co-defendants over an alleged attempt to steal the votes of thousands of Georgians. “You think I am on trial. These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020,” Willis said, pointing at the lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants. “I am not on trial no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.” History beckons on March 25 Despite the drama in Georgia, history may most remember the moment on Thursday morning when Judge Juan Merchan rejected Trump’s calls for delays and a dismissal and confirmed the country will cross a constitutional and legal Rubicon on March 25. His decision to lock in the previously selected date means the hypothetical possibility of a front-running candidate going on trial months before the election will become a somber reality. The case is considered by many legal experts to be the weakest of the four criminal trials Trump faces and relies on a somewhat novel legal theory. Even if he is convicted, Trump probably wouldn’t face jail time. But the spectacle of the United States putting its past and possibly future leader on trial will transfix the world. In itself, it represents a profound political and legal test for American democracy and the rule of law – even if it is only one of Trump’s legal threats. Trump wasted no time in making clear how he intends to fight the case, emerging from the courtroom to vent to reporters in a pen of crash barriers, cutting a disquieting metaphorical image of a former president who almost looked like he was behind bars. Trump accused Biden of “election interference” over the case, casting it as “the only way he can think to get elected because he’s accomplished nothing.” There is no evidence the White House intervened in any way in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s prosecution. Trump’s lawyer Todd Blanche told Merchan that the trial was unfair because the ex-president needed to campaign ahead of November’s election and called for a delay. “What’s your legal argument?” Merchan asked. “That is my legal argument,” Blanche replied, before the judge added: “That’s not a legal argument” as he adjourned the hearing. By March 25, Trump may well have piled up most of the delegates he needs to win the Republican nomination. If he’s not the presumptive nominee already, he could be before a verdict lands in a trial that could last a month to six weeks. In a normal election, Trump would be keen to turn his fire on his likely general election foe, Biden, by late March. But he will be forced to spend day after day in court in New York. Asked how he could possibly campaign, he responded: “I’ll do it in the evening.” There is no way of knowing how voters will react if the ex-president is convicted despite some recent polls suggesting that some Republicans may be less likely to support him after a guilty verdict. No one wants to go on trial, but if there was one case that the ex-president would prefer to face before the election it is the New York one. And despite his claims that he’ll never get a fair trial in Manhattan, a not guilty verdict could send its own shockwaves through the electorate. The former president’s politicized claims that he’s a victim of political persecution are only likely to be bolstered by news of a major development on Thursday that could undermine the House GOP’s impeachment goals. Special counsel David Weiss charged a former FBI informant with lying about the president and his son Hunter Biden’s involvement in business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. Alexander Smirnov, 43, was arrested Thursday at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, after his arrival in the US from overseas. Like any other defendant, Smirnov is entitled to the presumption of innocence. But because his evidence has been frequently cited by House GOP investigators, his arrest has significant political implications."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/election-2024-trump-new-york-trial/index.html,"CNN — Sometimes, when Donald Trump loses, he somehow seems to win as well. That may have been the case Thursday when two of the four criminal indictments against the former president appeared, at least momentarily, to turn in opposite directions. The trial date in his New York hush money case was confirmed to be March 25. Meanwhile, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis , who is bringing the election subversion case in Georgia, took the stand in a misconduct hearing surrounding her personal relationship with a prosecutor on her team. Trump’s lawyers are hoping to get the Georgia case thrown out or at least delayed over Willis’ conduct. Polling indicates that if Trump had to choose which case to go forward with at the fastest speed, he would most definitely, at this time, choose the New York case over the other ones. Most Americans just don’t think that the New York charges are all that serious. In fact, only 32% of voters said they were very serious in a Quinnipiac University poll taken toward the end of last year. This shouldn’t be all that surprising when you consider that everyone has long known about Trump’s supposed relationship with Stormy Daniels, which is a big part of New York prosecutor Alvin Bragg ’s case. The idea that Trump would be involved in paying off an adult film star, even if illegally, probably doesn’t shock that many people. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis speaks at a press conference next to prosecutor Nathan Wade after a Grand Jury brought back indictments against former president Donald Trump and his allies in their attempt to overturn the state's 2020 election results, in Atlanta, Georgia, on August 14, 2023. Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters/File Related article Georgia Trump prosecutor Fani Willis misconduct hearing: What to watch On the other hand, the same Quinnipiac polling revealed that 54% of voters said the charges in the Georgia case over Trump’s efforts to reverse his 2020 defeat in the state were very serious. This lines up with what we know about how the American public feels more broadly. We have a lot of data from after the 2020 election when Trump refused to concede and tried to overturn his loss to Joe Biden . Voter opinion of him slid during that period. Opinions of the two federal cases against him look a lot like that of Georgia. When it comes to Trump’s actions after the 2020 election and in the lead-up to the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, 56% said the charges were very serious. A similar 51% said the charges regarding his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving the White House were very serious. Other surveys confirm Quinnipiac’s general findings. Polling from AP-NORC shows that a similar majority of Americans think Trump did something illegal when it comes to pressuring Georgia public officials over the vote count in the state. Meanwhile, only about a third of them say Trump did something illegal when it comes to his actions around the New York hush money case. A plurality (38%) say he did something unethical, but not illegal. Of course, even if voters think Trump did something wrong in New York doesn’t mean they wouldn’t be willing to vote for him again. Just 30% of voters in a CNN/SSRS poll last year said that the New York charges, if true, would disqualify him from the presidency. Among voters who were at least initially undecided in a matchup between Trump and Biden, a similar 33% said the New York charges, if true, would disqualify him. Opinions could change Now, these numbers in the New York case could change if Trump were actually convicted and as voters pay more attention. After all, a hypothetical conviction is very different from an actual one. But if they hold steady, it’s not hard to see how Trump could get off relatively unscathed, even if he is found guilty in New York. He might also try to use the case to his political advantage. Not only could he try to rally his base (which he has done successfully in past legal fights), but he could also try to convince those in the middle that he’s been unfairly prosecuted in a case in which many don’t think he did something illegal. That well could be the case if the New York case finishes first, which looks most likely given that it will probably start first. Trump might try to influence public perceptions about the other cases based on how people feel about the New York one. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis takes the stand on Thursday in Atlanta. Pool Related article Takeaways from Fani Willis’ stunning testimony in Georgia Because at this moment, the public sees those other cases far differently in the context of the 2024 election. Using the Georgia election subversion case as an example, a near majority (49%) of voters in the CNN/SSRS poll said the charges in Georgia, if true, would be disqualifying for Trump and the presidency. It’s much harder to win an election when about half the voters think you should be disqualified. Among the at least initially undecided voters in the same survey, 58% said the Georgia charges would be disqualifying, if true. In an election as tight as 2024 will be, you really don’t want to have 58% of undecided voters saying that. Of course, the Georgia case is currently on an uncertain timeline with a lead prosecutor who may not end up being the prosecutor who brings the case to trial. Additionally, we have to contend with the fact that we don’t know how the court proceedings in Georgia could affect opinions of the case, even if Willis remains the prosecutor leading it. The bottom line is that no one wants to be on trial, but if Trump had to pick, he’d much rather go first with the New York case."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/trump-state-prosecutions-new-york-georgia/index.html,"CNN — Two cases that could defy Donald Trump’s capacity to thwart prosecutions and even to overturn eventual convictions against him if he returns to the White House reach critical tests on Thursday with major implications for the 2024 election. In the latest remarkable twist of his multiple legal sagas, Trump is in court in New York for a procedural hearing ahead of his trial over a hush money payment to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Over Trump’s objection, a judge confirmed that his trial will start on March 25 , when jury selection begins. It will mark the first time the fate of an ex-president and potential presidential nominee has been put to a jury in a criminal case. While Trump is in court in New York , he also is at the center of another drama in Georgia where a judge is holding an evidentiary hearing into an attempt to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and to throw out a vast racketeering case against Trump and associates over his attempt to subvert President Joe Biden ’s 2020 election win in the swing state. Judge Scott McAfee has already said that Willis could be disqualified if she benefited financially from a romantic relationship with a colleague she appointed to be a prosecutor in the case. Most of Trump’s legal filings in various cases have one thing in common: an attempt to prevent them from moving to trial and to delay accountability — at least until the next election. Trump has a particular interest in stopping the New York hush money and Georgia election interference cases because even as president with a sympathetic attorney general, he would find it difficult to interfere in ongoing prosecutions, to overturn convictions or even to pardon himself since this executive power does not cover state crimes. The high-stakes hearings nearly 900 miles apart speak to the extraordinary entanglement of the 2024 election and Trump’s legal quagmire that now spans multiple presidential elections. Thursday will not even be the first time this week that the ex-president’s legal plight is playing out in two separate cities. On Monday for instance, Trump was in court in Fort Pierce, Florida, for a hearing over his indictment related to retaining classified documents on a day when his lawyers sent a filing to the US Supreme Court in Washington based on his expansive demands for absolute presidential immunity to shield him from his actions after the 2020 election. Emphasizing his constant double duty in the courtroom and the campaign trial, the former president gave a fiery speech in South Carolina Wednesday night ahead of the state’s primary later this month – before heading to New York. “They’re weaponizing law enforcement for high level election interference — that’s what they’ve done,” he said. “I am being indicted for you, never forget,” Trump told his crowd. “I am delighted to be doing it.” Just before Trump spoke, special counsel Jack Smith sent his reply to Trump’s immunity claims to the Supreme Court, arguing that there was a vital public interest in seeing him tried — though amid the accused’s claims of political persecution, Smith didn’t specifically reference the narrowing calendar before November’s election. In yet another case, another judge in New York is expected to rule on Friday whether Trump will have to pay hundreds of millions in dollars over ill-gotten gains exposed in a civil fraud trial that targeted the ex-president, his adult sons and the Trump Organization. The ruling could remove Trump’s capacity to do business in New York — the city where he made his name. The legal and political collision that seems to become more intense with every passing week makes it all but certain the current election will sow divisive, long-term aftereffects however Trump’s legal perils end that will deepen the country’s political estrangement and further damage trust in electoral and judicial institutions. Trump is back in the city where he made his name The former president is making a habit of showing up in court and staging histrionics to express his contempt for the legal system and to frame the prosecutions he’s facing as political persecution — the dominant theme of his 2024 election campaign. Outside court in New York on Thursday, Trump offered a preview of his tactics ahead of the coming trial, accusing President Joe Biden’s White House of running “election interference.” There is, however, no basis for Trump’s claims that the White House has any role in directing the district attorney’s case. Trump’s presence has the potential to turn any sober legal hearing into a circus, and several judges have become infuriated as they struggle to keep him under control. In the New York case, Trump is facing 34 charges of falsifying business records. He allegedly did so to cover up payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public over an alleged past affair in a way that could influence voters. The ex-president, who denies the affair, has pleaded not guilty in this case, as he has to all four of his criminal indictments. Some legal experts see the New York case as the least serious of the four criminal threats facing the former president, and even if he is convicted, he is not expected to face a jail term. Others, however, see the 2016 case as the first stirrings of Trump’s attempts to mislead voters and to interfere in the conduct of US elections. As the expected first criminal trial, the New York case could still have important political implications. So far, polling evidence and the results of early Republican primary races suggest that Trump’s indictments have served to unite the party’s grass roots voters behind his campaign. But the impact of Trump’s legal problems on a wider electorate is still to be tested. Several recent polls have suggested that some voters could have second thoughts about him if he is a convicted felon by Election Day. A vital sideshow to Trump’s racketeering trial will take place in Georgia In Georgia, McAfee is holding an evidentiary hearing into allegations that Willis benefited financially from a romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade after she hired him. “The issues at point here are whether a relationship existed, whether that relationship was romantic or non-romantic in nature, when it formed and whether it continues,” McAfee said Monday. “And that’s only relevant because it’s in combination with the question of the existence and extent of any benefit conveyed as a result of their relationship.” One of Trump’s co-defendants, Michael Roman, is alleging that Willis and Wade benefited significantly from the case at the expense of taxpayers and that there is a significant conflict of interest. He is citing financial statements from Wade’s divorce proceedings to argue that he took Willis on lavish vacations after she hired him. Roman is calling both for the dismissal of Willis and for the shelving of the entire case, arguing that it has raised questions about fairness in the legal system and that the entire prosecution has been tainted by the drama. But a lawyer for the district attorney is accusing Roman of trying to divert attention from the underlying case. “The defense is not bringing you facts, the defense is not bringing you law, the defense is bringing you gossip,” attorney Anna Cross said. “The court should not condone that practice.” In an amicus brief filed with the court, a group of legal experts, former prosecutors and law professors argued that even if all the allegations against Willis are true, “they do not mandate disqualification here. Indeed they do not come close.” Willis has suggested that the allegations are motivated by race. “Is it that some will never see a Black man as qualified, no matter his achievements?” Willis said last month at Big Bethel AME Church in Atlanta, referencing Wade without specifically naming him. Speaking on CNN “This Morning” in January, Michael Moore, a former US Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said that the allegations against Willis would not be “destructive” to the vast racketeering case against Trump and his fellow defendants. At the same time, however, a change of prosecutor could substantially delay the proceedings, in a way that plays into some of Trump’s goals. At one point, CNN reported, Trump had shown an interest in attending Thursday’s hearing in Georgia rather than the one in New York, but he was convinced that since he was personally affected by the latter case it would make more sense for him to be there. In the likely event that the judge in New York rejects Trump’s dismissal motion, the ex-president is certain to claim that he is being political victimized. And if Willis is not dismissed from the case in Georgia, he is sure to use the mere existence of allegations against her to argue that justice has been tainted and that those seeking to call him to account are corrupt. This does not only have the political effect of solidifying Trump’s appeal to supporters as he claims he’s a victim of witch hunts. It also bolsters his long-term attempts to create a public narrative that any future convictions against him will be unjust."

This time, Trump had a choice – he might also have attended a hearing in Georgia, where District Attorney Fani Willis, who is overseeing his election interference case in the state, faces allegations of misconduct related to her relationship with a prosecutor she appointed to oversee the case, a soap opera on the side of the Trump trials. Trump routinely manipulates the media spectacle outside court by rambling on about his criminal prosecutions and his political rivals. The details vary, but the main talking points stay largely the same and are repeated on a loop: political persecution, crime-ridden cities and his strong polling. Here’s some of what Trump said Thursday in New York before heading into the courtroom, along with context. Everything that I’ve heard and read, even from legal scholars, said there’s absolutely no case here. It’s not a crime. This is not a crime. It’s not clear what legal scholars Trump is referring to, but he says he’s not guilty of crimes in all four of the criminal cases he’s facing. He will repeat variations of “this is not a crime” as a kind of mantra throughout these comments. This particular case, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg , relates to hush-money payments to squash three separate, negative stories before the 2016 election. Payments were made to a former Trump Tower doorman by the parent company of the National Enquirer, American Media Inc., to buy the doorman’s story about an alleged Trump affair and Trump-fathered child. It was a “catch and kill” effort by the Enquirer, which never published the story it had bought. The Trump Organization has denied the affair allegation. Six-figure payments were also made by AMI to “catch and kill” the story of a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with Trump. He denies it. Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen also paid $130,000 to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels through a shell company days before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels said she had an affair with Trump in 2006. Trump denies the allegation. But he compensated Cohen for the Daniels payment, and his company described the payment to Daniels as legal expenses. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payments and served time in jail. Trump was never charged by federal prosecutors, perhaps in part because the Department of Justice has a policy of not prosecuting presidents. The crime Trump is now accused of in New York is 34 counts of falsifying business records and misrepresenting the payments in order to influence the 2016 election. When you look at what’s going on outside on the streets, where violent crime is at an all-time high, I think it’s very, very – it’s a great double standard. Claiming violent crime in cites, especially those run by Democrats, is one of Trump’s favorite talking points. The idea that violent crime is at an “all-time high” is completely untrue, as CNN’s Daniel Dale wrote last October. Crime rates have fallen since then. In data released by the New York City Police Department , rates of murder, rape, assault, burglary and car theft were all down in January 2024 compared with January 2023. Robbery and grand larceny increased. Dale pointed out in his fact check that the actual violent crime rates were much higher decades ago, when these horrible records were set. It’s also worth noting that Trump is trying to compare his white-collar crimes with violent crimes, which seems like a false comparison. There are nonviolent crimes that are still crimes. Whether Trump is guilty will be up to a jury. We’re here for something that is not a crime. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. What it is is election interference. It’s being run by Joe Biden’s White House. His top person was placed here in order to make sure everything goes right. This is a terrible time for our country. This is a real dark period for our country. Trump often repeats this claim that his four, separate criminal trials are a coordinated “election interference” scheme. Not only does it flip the script on the fact that it is he who has been charged in state court in Georgia and federal court in Washington, DC, with election interference, but it also plays into his larger claim that anything opposed to him is part of a “witch hunt.” It’s false and ridiculous to think that these cases are all coordinated by the Biden administration. A special counsel, Jack Smith , appointed to be autonomous from the Justice Department, is overseeing the two federal criminal prosecutions. Bragg is overseeing this hush-money prosecution. Willis is overseeing the Georgia state election case. Anyone ranking the severity of trials against Trump would probably like to see his federal election interference trial go first on the calendar. But the judge in Manhattan has filled Trump’s calendar at the end of March, when that federal trial could theoretically have taken place. The federal trial date is on hold while the Supreme Court considers Trump’s argument that he has absolute immunity from prosecution for acts conducted while he was president. (Biden’s) top person, Colangelo, and some others have been placed into the DA’s office to make sure they do a good job of election interference. There’s never been anything like this in the history of our country. What is this? While Trump first alleged that Biden “stuffed” the Manhattan DA’s office last year before he was indicted, this new detail is a head scratcher. Dale explains that Matthew Colangelo is a former Justice Department official who is now a senior counsel to Bragg. Their relationship predates Colangelo’s time at the Department of Justice. There is also a pattern of Trump seeking to question people in the justice system. In his civil fraud trial in the case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, for instance, he seized on a clerk to the judge and alleged she was tied to Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader. The details will change, but Trump finding a person to demonize is predictable. With all of this being said, I look outside, I look at the streets. It’s so different from when I left New York. It’s so different. It’s dirty and it’s crime-ridden. And today, you walk down the street, you get mugged or you get shot. And they are doing this where literally legal experts, legal scholars said they don’t understand that there’s no crime, and there was no crime here at all. He’s looping. See above. This is just a way of hurting me in the election because I’m leading by a lot. We’re leading by numbers that nobody’s ever seen before. Trump is certainly leading, and perhaps untouchable, in the race for the Republican nomination. In many polls, he does currently have a slim lead in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But his lead is far from unprecedented. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan are Republicans who won true landslide victories, carrying nearly every state in a general election. No one is talking about that kind of victory for Trump. They figure this is their way of cheating this time. Last time, they had a different way. This time, they have something that’s really down and dirty that, no, frankly, no country does other than a third-world country, a banana republic. There is not now and there has never been evidence of systemic or widespread cheating to defeat Trump in either 2016 or 2020, although he has alleged as much for both elections. It is certainly true that political rivals in weak democracies and autocracies face political prosecutions. Look at Alexey Navalny and multiple other critics of President Vladimir Putin who have been jailed after questionable prosecutions in Russia. But to compare the US judicial system to that of a banana republic is ridiculous. Juries will determine Trump’s guilt or innocence. A Supreme Court with three Trump-appointed justices has final review of the system that is prosecuting him. So we’re going to do our process. They want to rush it because they want to get it desperately before the election. By “they,” Trump presumably means all of the distinct authorities trying to prosecute him. By “our process,” he means his strategy of delay, delay, delay. Trump’s legal strategy is to win the election. If he wins in November, the likely outcome is that his two federal cases, if unresolved, would go away. State prosecutions are different. It’s not clear that a state could not prosecute a president or a president-elect, but any prosecutions would certainly be complicated. After the election, they wouldn’t have brought, this except for the fact, no way, except for the fact I’m running for president and doing well. If I were doing poorly, they wouldn’t have brought it. Trump’s prosecutions actually seem to have helped him in the Republican nomination race. His base has rallied around him, and his rivals have been unable to gain a serious foothold. We want delays, obviously, I’m running for election. I can’t – how can you run for election if you’re sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again, this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be at a courthouse. Actually, given the choice, Trump has frequently attended court hearings over campaign events – either in his criminal cases or in his $370 million civil fraud trial, where a verdict is expected as soon as Friday. Dale writes in a fact check that, no, Trump was not stuck in court today. The former president did not need to appear for this hearing. He had no South Carolina events scheduled and plans to fly back to Florida after the hearing. When he says “other people,” he’s referring to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his last remaining serious rival for the Republican nomination. Polling suggests he has a commanding lead over Haley in her home state as the GOP primary there approaches. Virtually every legal scholar says they don’t understand it, that there’s no crime. Even if he was guilty of something, there’s no crime. So I will say that, uh, enjoy it. Here, he’s both looping and making the provocative claim that he could be guilty but not be a criminal. It’s a sad thing. It’s a sad day for New York. They really do, look, I love this city and I love this state. They have to focus on violent crime taking place outside. You have a new form of crime now. You have migrant crime. Migrants are trying to beat up our police officers. They’re trying to do things that we’ve never seen before, actually. We are going to have a problem with – I call it Biden migrant crime, because you have millions of people who came into this place, this country that has been so badly hurt and they are they are doing things that nobody’s ever seen before. So you have violent migrant crime. Trump has built his presidential campaign around two main pillars: retribution for his 2020 loss, which he still does not accept, and being tougher on border policy. Here he marries the twin pillars of his campaign with the phrase “Biden migrant crime.” In New York, officials are dealing with a crush of asylum-seeking migrants who have been bused to the city from Texas and elsewhere. New York’s mayor has complained about the strain on the city and its services. And he has also recently helped feed the notion that crime in the city is being perpetrated by migrants, who under federal rules cannot obtain a work permit until they have been in the country for six months. More than 150,000 migrants have arrived in New York City, and there have been viral videos of migrants involved in criminal activity. But as The New York Times notes , despite the rising number of migrants in the city, violent crime has dropped. And they’re after me for doing nothing wrong. You know, I paid almost $300 million in taxes over the period of time. $300 million. And they say, oh, let’s get Trump out. You have people that – it’s everything is politics in this city, including decisions and judges and everything else. It has to straighten out and they have to focus on violent crime, not made-up crime. Wait, what? Trump has persistently refused to release his tax returns so his claim that he paid $300 million in taxes “over the period of time” is unverifiable. If a person is a money-making billionaire, it’s possible that paying $300 million represents a lower tax rate than many other Americans. Is he referring to federal taxes? State taxes? We do know, because some years of his returns were leaked, that there were years in which he paid no federal income tax because he claimed massive losses from previous years. In the year he won the White House and in his first year as president, he paid $750 in federal income taxes. We also know that Trump’s general outlook on taxes is to pay as little as possible."

CNN — The immigration and border crisis is quickly morphing into the dominant issue of American politics – and Democrats are pivoting faster than Republicans at the moment. GOP lawmakers have long claimed immigration as their top issue, raising the alarm about the drastic rise of migrants and asylum-seekers at the southern border. Blaming President Joe Biden for the border crisis is the backbone of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. But after a defeat in a special election to fill a New York House seat, Republicans might be wondering if they are being outmaneuvered by Democrats who are adjusting to acknowledge the crisis and suddenly preaching bipartisanship. A drastic, new migrant policy under consideration by the Biden administration will only heap pressure on Republicans to relent and seek middle ground with the White House even as they complain about Biden’s current policy. Here’s what’s happened with immigration so far this week: Republicans, committed to casting blame, impeach Mayorkas. It took two tries, but House Republicans made their point and voted by the narrowest possible margin to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , the first impeachment of a Cabinet secretary since the 1870s. The Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, will surely acquit Mayorkas or figure out a way to dismiss the charges, but not without an unwanted spectacle. There are consequences for failing to legislate. After the failure of a bipartisan Senate compromise to revamp border policy and add funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Biden administration has drawn up a draft contingency plan to address a massive budget shortfall by cutting detention capacity and releasing thousands of immigrants. The House GOP majority shrank. It’s a good thing for the Republicans who supported the impeachment that they got it done Tuesday night, since Democrats picked up a seat in the special election to replace disgraced former Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from the House in December. Democrats are triangulating. How did the winner in New York, former Rep. Tom Suozzi , win back his old seat? He tacked to the middle specifically on the issue of immigration, hammering Republicans for refusing to work with Democrats on an immigration compromise. “Let’s send a message to our friends running the Congress these days: Stop running around for Trump, and start running the country,” Suozzi told supporters after claiming victory Tuesday night. A migrant family leaves the Row Hotel in midtown Manhattan January 10, 2024. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Immigration is a major issue in New York City. Immigration might have been the issue on which Republicans could have kept the seat despite the bad taste Santos may have left in voters’ mouths. A serial fabulist who misrepresented just about everything in his background, Santos is set to be prosecuted for, among other things, defrauding donors to his 2022 campaign. But New York is feeling the pinch of the immigration crisis. Mayor Eric Adams has complained the city can no longer cope with the thousands of migrants being shipped to the city by, among others, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Republicans say NBD. Even though Suozzi’s win shrinks the narrow House Republican majority even further and makes it more difficult for Speaker Mike Johnson to pass any legislation, Johnson told fellow GOP lawmakers not to panic during a closed-door meeting Wednesday, according to CNN’s Capitol Hill team. Later, he noted that Democrats spent more money on the race than Republicans and told reporters that Suozzi won because he “ran like a Republican.” “He sounded like a Republican, talking about the border and immigration, because everybody knows that’s the top issue,” Johnson said. Except voters concerned about immigration told CNN reporters that it was also dysfunction on Capitol Hill – Republicans rejected even the idea of a bipartisan immigration deal last week – that drove their votes. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate joined together to pass a foreign aid package this week after it was decoupled from the border compromise. But Johnson opposes allowing votes on that bill too. This is the definition of a catch-22. Without any irony after helping kill the border compromise, Johnson said he could not accept any aid for Ukraine and Israel until there is action on the border. “House Republicans were crystal clear from the very beginning of discussions that any so-called national security supplemental legislation must recognize that national security begins at our own border,” Johnson said in a statement, days after helping kill legislation to address the situation at the border. Democrats are embracing the rhetoric of bipartisanship – for now. Reacting to Suozzi’s victory, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that voters respond to people who want to solve problems. “Tom Suozzi talked about common-sense solutions. And finding bipartisan common ground. Tom Suozzi won,” Jeffries said. Fight or flight? It’s perfectly reasonable to wonder why anyone would want to work on Capitol Hill. Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin , one of three Republicans to vote against impeaching Mayorkas, was surrounded and pressured by colleagues on the House floor last week during the first impeachment effort. Days later, he announced he would not run for reelection. “Electoral politics was never supposed to be a career and, trust me, Congress is no place to grow old,” Gallagher, who had been viewed as a rising star in the party, said in a statement. Compare that with former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan , an anti-Trump Republican who recently announced he would run for a seat in the US Senate after previously saying he had no interest in working on Capitol Hill. He still isn’t exactly excited about it, Hogan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “Inside Politics” on Wednesday. “Who in their right mind would want to go in and be a part of that divisiveness and dysfunction?” Hogan asked. But he made the decision a week ago, he said, after the “debacle that took place on the Senate floor” when the bipartisan immigration deal was abandoned. Biden, he argued, has failed to secure the border. But Republicans, given the opportunity to work toward a solution, backed off. “I thought it was typical dysfunction,” he later added. “I’m frustrated with both parties down there, and that’s a perfect example – it’s an important thing that most people in America want us to solve, and it’s not getting solved because it’s just typical Washington politics.”"

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — Lawmakers from both parties last December may have been anticipating former President Donald Trump’s current NATO trash talk when they quietly slipped language limiting a president’s power to pull the US out the alliance into the annual defense policy bill , which passed with bipartisan support. Trump boasted at a weekend campaign rally that as president he told an unidentified NATO leader that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” with member countries who are in arrears on defense spending. The whole point of NATO is supposed to be that members act to defend each other if attacked. President Joe Biden seized on Trump’s recent NATO bashing, suggesting in Tuesday remarks from the White House that Trump was the first president who “bowed down” to a Russian dictator, which Biden said was “dumb,” “shameful,” “dangerous” and “un-American.” Add that criticism to a chorus of alarm from NATO and European officials after Trump’s comments and in the midst of House Republicans’ blockage of additional aid for Ukraine. Trump’s desire to pull out of NATO The post-World War II alliance of Western democracies was built around NATO, but Trump has long complained that the US is getting a raw deal with the organization, paying too much and getting too little. Trump’s ultimate goal, writes CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen , has long been to pull the US out of NATO, which was formed in 1949 to contain the threat of the Soviet Union and the spread of communism and is now organized around deterring Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN’s Jim Sciutto, in a forthcoming book , quotes a former official in both the Trump and Biden administrations who predicts a Trump election win in November would mean “the US will be out of NATO.” Sciutto also writes about how Trump nearly pulled the US from the alliance during a 2018 NATO meeting. At the same time, Trump tried to claim credit, arguing it is his tough talk and not the threat of Russian invasion that has caused NATO member countries to increase their defense budgets in recent years. What’s to stop him? If Trump wins the 2024 election and does turn on NATO, he would run into that new language from Congress, which says the president “shall not suspend, terminate, denounce, or withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty” without either a supermajority vote in the Senate or an act passed by the full Congress. When I asked the former US Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker about what Trump could do to undermine NATO as president, he first pointed out that Trump was boasting about his interaction with an unnamed world leader rather than promising future action. Kurt Volker testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on November 19, 2019, in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The Constitution, Volker noted, says the Senate must be involved with ratifying treaties but it is silent on the subject of withdrawing from a treaty. Any court battle could take years. Alternatives to withdrawal Rather than attempting to withdraw from NATO, a second Trump presidency could allow his allies to pursue a policy of making NATO “ dormant ,” an idea pushed by at least one Trump-allied think tank. Nobody knows exactly what that would look like, Volker said, but the president has immense power over how the US interacts with its allies. “There’s lots of things that you can do administratively as the commander in chief that would still be very disruptive for NATO,” Volker said. A president could reduce the number of exercises Americans take part in with NATO allies, further reduce troop presence in Europe, withhold payments to the NATO infrastructure or cut down on the US military budget. The US would still be bound, under this type of scenario, by the pledge to defend other NATO nations, but it would not be prepared. “It’s not just enough to say, yes, we will fight together,” said Volker. “You actually have to have the capabilities.” Americans lead NATO by design If Trump wins the election this year and then seeks as president to reduce American military participation, he could, in theory, recall the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower first held the job after NATO’s founding, and ever since, the top NATO commander has always been an American admiral or general. NATO’s power to deter attacks on other countries rests in large part on American nuclear weapons, and so it is appropriate that an American service member sits atop the NATO structure, according to Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. This December 1957 photo shows heads of government, including US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, attending the annual ""family portrait"" during NATO top-level meetings at the Palais de Chaillot. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Pulling American generals out of NATO might force other NATO countries to seek their own nuclear deterrents. Part of the reason Europeans have not pursued a collective European military is by American design and a result of security provided by NATO, Bergmann said. Countries are eager to be protected by Article 5 of NATO’s charter, which is the principle that an attack on one member is an attack on all of the members. Sweden and Finland have both worked hard to join after Russia invaded non-member Ukraine. Finland joined in 2023, and Sweden is inching closer to accession . That provision that Trump dislikes has only been invoked one time, after 9/11, when the US and NATO allies invaded Afghanistan after terror attacks brought down the World Trade Center and struck the Pentagon. More members hit 2% benchmark Trump frequently complains that NATO members other than the US don’t pay dues, which is a misstatement of facts . Members are supposed to spend a minimum of 2% of their GDP on defense, but it is just a guideline that doesn’t require payments to NATO or the US. Multiple NATO countries do not hit that benchmark, although spending has risen since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “That argument is weaker and weaker, because allies are indeed spending more and doing more,” Volker said. NATO’s charter is a relatively short and simple document. Its section on how a country withdraws from the alliance is further evidence of how central the US is to the organization: A country wishing to withdraw must notify the US a year before it plans to withdraw. No country, by the way, has ever withdrawn from NATO, although France did not take part in NATO’s military operations from the mid-1960s until 2009. A difficult relationship to unbreak If Trump is reelected and chooses to hollow out NATO or make US participation dormant, it would sever ties that future presidents might have trouble repairing. “It’s just like any relationship,” said Bergmann of the likelihood of permanent damage if Trump were to materially alter the NATO alliance. “This would be seen as the US basically having a massive affair and like cheating on Europe. Could the marriage be restored? Well, potentially. But it would require, I think, a lot of effort on the part of future administrations.” Marco Rubio is not worried Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was a sponsor of the new law meant to prohibit a president from leaving NATO. Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, he dismissed the threat posed by Trump. “He’s telling a story,” Rubio said, adding, “He doesn’t talk like a traditional politician, and we’ve already been through this. You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.” “I have zero concern, because he’s been president before. I know exactly what he has done and will do with the NATO alliance,” Rubio said, although he added, “But there has to be an alliance.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/new-york-special-election-biden-trump/index.html,"CNN — Democrats, when confronted with President Joe Biden ’s poor polling numbers, often counter with some form of the following: “Polls are polls, but when people vote, Democrats are doing well.” The idea being that Democrats have done well in major special and off-year elections since the 2022 midterms. The special election in New York’s 3rd Congressional District to succeed the infamous George Santos offers perhaps the best chance to test Democrats’ theory ahead of the presidential election. Does former Rep. Tom Suozzi win in yet another example of Democrats defying national polling trends? Or does Nassau County Legislator Mazi Pilip secure victory, showing how Republicans are winning pivotal races in places Biden comfortably won in 2020? Yes, we’re looking at just one election on Long Island, but it’s a fascinating one. As we enter Election Day, the race seems far too close to call. A Newsday/Siena College poll released last week put Suozzi at 48% and Pilip at 44%, a result well within the margin of error. Throw in forecasted bad weather in this Nassau County and eastern Queens district, and we really can’t be certain who will emerge victorious. The fact that the race is tight makes sense if you look at the district’s recent voting record . I mentioned that Biden carried the seat in 2020 (by 8 points), but local Republicans have been dominating since. They did well in 2023’s local races . GOP candidates for governor and US Senate won the district by margins between 4 and 12 points in 2022, as did Santos. This means that even a narrow Suozzi victory would be impressive for Democrats given how well Republicans have done in other elections in the area. Indeed, outside of Long Island, Democrats did well in last year’s big elections. They won the Kentucky gubernatorial election , maintained their majority in the Virginia Senate and flipped the Virginia House . The candidate favored by Democrats won a Wisconsin Supreme Court race , which gave the more liberal justices a majority on that court. A lot of analysts (myself included) have been skeptical about making too much of these results. Turnout in off-year elections is often low. Voters who have been showing up for these off-year races have been more Democratic-leaning than their share of all registered voters in the same states and districts     . Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at the Hyatt Hotel in Coralville, Iowa, on December 13. Scott Olson/Getty Images Related article Why Donald Trump should be hoping for high voter turnout Of course, we’re now in a presidential election year, and there are also signs that these off-year results may have been pointing at something important. Yes, the turnout may have been more Democratic than among all registered voters. But the turnout in the presidential election may be as well. Most national pollsters are gauging responses from registered voters. Not all registered voters will cast a ballot in the presidential election. When pollsters such as Ipsos and The New York Times have honed on either those certain to vote or those likely to vote this year, Biden has done significantly better against his likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump . Ipsos, for example, recently showed a 5-point lead for the former president among registered voters becoming a tie among those certain to vote. A Suozzi win would further prove the point that Democrats do well when voters are treated to an actual campaign. On the other hand, a win by Pilip would give us a different narrative. This is the only federal election since the midterms that has been remotely competitive. All the other competitive races were state elections, and voting patterns between US House and presidential elections are far more correlated than they are for state offices and presidential elections. While it would be easy to dismiss a Pilip win by saying that Long Island has swung to the right since 2020, the rest of the country may have as well. Remember that in the last high-turnout election (the 2022 midterms), Republicans won control of the US House . They did so while winning the House popular vote by 3 points. That Republican victory represented a 6-point swing from the 2020 House elections . Moreover, that 3-point Republican edge in 2022 looks a lot like Trump’s current advantage over Biden among registered voters nationally. In other words, it’s possible that the national environment hasn’t moved all that much from the last time Republicans secured an important win. So a victory by Pilip would suggest that perhaps things aren’t all that different from where we were in 2022. This would mean that we have a closely divided electorate, but one with which Republicans are favored. Either way, you can bet your last dollar that both sides will try to spin the New York special election result. What else would you expect when there’s been more than $10 million spent on ads , which I can report have been playing nonstop on local television."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/trump-appeal-scotus-delay-tactic-analysis/index.html,"Donald Trump’s filing to the Supreme Court over his claim for sweeping presidential immunity begins with a quote from Yogi Berra. “This application is déjà vu all over again,” the former president’s lawyers write, noting that special counsel Jack Smith had tried and failed to get the nine justices to decide the question on a fast-track basis in December. But another of the late and revered New York Yankees catcher’s phrases offers a better summation of Trump’s interminable delay-at-all-costs legal strategy designed to defer a reckoning until after November’s election — “It ain’t over till it’s over.” The ex-president asked the Supreme Court on Monday to step in to temporarily block a US Court of Appeals decision that last week eviscerated his claims that a president is effectively above the law while in office and shielded from prosecution afterwards. The filing is Trumpian in its audacity. In essence, it argues that it would be unfair to millions of voters if the ex-President cannot get his message out in the 2024 election because he is on trial over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The former president was less concerned about the rights of voters when he sought to thwart their choice to eject him from office in 2020. After an unprecedented effort by Trump to interrupt the cherished tradition of peaceful transfers of power three years ago, Trump’s attorneys nevertheless insist the real “stunning breach of precedent and historical norms” is that the lower court ruled that presidential immunity for official acts does not exist at all. While Trump argues he was using presidential power in a legitimate effort to bring to light electoral fraud, there is nothing in the Constitution that gives the president the right or duty to officially administer elections, count votes or contact local election officials as the ex-president is alleged to have done. The coming days could decide when the first Trump trial takes place The text of Trump’s filing to the court at times feels somewhat frivolous. In tone and depth, it contrasts to the tightly argued repudiation of his claims for immunity last week by three appeals court judges that was widely praised by legal scholars. And it reflected the extraordinarily broad and improbable vision of almost unconstrained presidential power to which Trump warmed in office and that he appears to relish regaining if he wins November’s election ahead of a term he has vowed would be devoted to retribution against his enemies. “This brief, this petition for a stay, is pretty weak,” Ty Cobb, a former counsel in Trump’s White House, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “I don’t think the Supreme Court is going to find these arguments compelling in any way.” Trump’s latest request comes at a critical moment because the steps that the Supreme Court takes in coming days will likely decide whether this case — one of the most potentially damaging of the four criminal trials that await Trump — will go to a jury before the election. This is not just a matter of seeking accountability for the ex-president’s bid to stay in power despite losing the last election to President Joe Biden. It could also sway the destiny of the White House since some polls, including a national NBC News survey this month , suggest that some Trump voters may not support him if he’s a convicted felon when they go to vote. In what is expected to be a close election, even small-scale defections from Biden could weigh on the result. Trump’s legal team has a good reason to try to run out the clock. Therefore its moves should be assessed as much for their political impact as for the quality of litigation in an election season that has merged Trump’s legal and campaign strategies. Trump asked the Supreme Court to put the entire case on hold to allow him to pursue the full extent of his rights as an appellant, potentially to include a so-called en banc appeal to a full bench of appeals court judges and then ultimately to the high court, a process that could take many weeks or months. But it is not certain that the Supreme Court, which last week heard oral arguments on another Trump case — over his expulsion from Colorado’s ballot — will even agree to take his latest request. The special counsel has until February 20 to respond to Trump’s petition, though Smith is likely to file much earlier. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the real world impact of the new petition was that it would “almost certainly dictate whether or not Donald Trump goes on trial on Jack Smith’s election case before or after the 2024 election.” First, the Supreme Court must decide whether to grant a stay, but Honig said, “The bigger question is: Will the Supreme Court ultimately take this case? If they do not take the case it’s going to go back down to the district court, and I think we are very likely looking at a trial this summer. If they do take the case and set it on something close to a normal schedule, I think in all likelihood that would push the timeline here out until after the 2024 election — that’s how big the stakes are.” Norm Eisen, another CNN legal analyst, said that the court would likely grant some kind of stay, but that even if it did decide to take the case, the court could put it on an expedited schedule. “The long-term odds for success are poor. But it’s a delay game at this point,” Eisen said. But Trump and Smith both know time is short with a trial threatening to coincide with the heat of the presidential election. “The really precarious situation that Jack Smith finds themselves in and the Justice Department find themselves in is that every day matters at this point, given the calendar and the political calendar,” Ankush Khardori, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I don’t expect them to countenance the whole delaying tactic, at least I hope that they will not, but we are now starting to cut it pretty close here.” Trump’s extraordinary collision of legal peril As is often the case, Trump had a crowded legal docket on Monday. The historic spectacle of a former president making an unprecedented request for blanket immunity — that appears to fly in the face of founding US principles of constraining unaccountable executive power — only emerged after an earlier court appearance. The former president took part in a closed hearing in Florida as his lawyers haggled with Smith’s team for access to classified material pertinent to the case over his hoarding of secret government documents at his resort home. As with Smith’s Washington case, Trump’s team is seeking to delay the trial currently scheduled for May. The former president is also expected in court on Thursday in Manhattan, in a hearing related to a hush money payment sent to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. That case is now expected to be the first of Trump’s four criminal trials to go ahead at the end of March — after the judge in the federal elections case postponed the start of her proceeding pending the ex-president’s appeals. Trump is hoping meanwhile that Fani Willis, the district attorney leading his Georgia election subversion case, could be dismissed following the disclosure of a personal relationship with a lead prosecutor. A hearing is set for Thursday after a judge presiding over the case said Willis could be disqualified if she financially benefited from the relationship. And in yet another fateful development in court his week for Trump, a New York judge is expected to issue his ruling on Friday over how much Trump will have to pay over ill-gotten gains related to a civil fraud trial targeting the former President, the Trump Organization and his adult sons. A large chunk of Trump’s fortune is at risk in the case as well as his capacity to do business in New York state. This stunning roster of cases is an oppressive load for any defendant — let alone one running for president – but it does not even complete the full extent of his legal liabilities. However, it raises the prospect of a dark period ahead for Trump if he doesn’t win the 2024 election and is not able to use presidential power to halt trials or reverse convictions in any of the federal proceedings against him. This story has been updated with additional developments."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — While the 2024 presidential race seems set in stone as a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, it’s also true that things happen. Back in November 1872, for instance, the newspaper publisher and Democratic presidential candidate Horace Greeley died after Election Day but before the casting of Electoral College votes. While it did not affect the outcome – President Ulysses S. Grant easily won reelection – Greeley’s death created the difficult question of what to do with the 66 Electoral College votes he had won. Most electors, meeting in state capitols, did not cast votes for the deceased Greeley, but rather split them among four other candidates . Congress did not count the three votes that were cast for a dead man. Pictured is American abolitionist, journalist and politician Horace Greeley, who edited the New York Tribune. MPI/Getty Images In the more than 150 years since Greeley’s death, there have been two constitutional amendments related to presidential succession, but there is still some gray area when it comes to an unforeseen event that strikes a presidential nominee or candidate. Today, polling suggests voters are worried that both Trump and Biden are too old for the job. Trump will be 78 on Election Day in November, and Biden will turn 82 later that month. Without being macabre, it’s worth knowing what would happen if, for whatever reason, either man was unable to continue with the race. Replacing either man on the ballot – not that anyone is seriously talking about it – would be a messy and chaotic process that would uncover divisions and disagreements within the political parties. No one knows for sure what would happen if a candidate died or for some reason needed to withdraw from the race. Here’s a look at the rules for Republicans and Democrats as they currently stand. What happens if a candidate cannot continue his or her campaign? The process of replacing a presidential candidate very much depends on when the vacancy occurs – during the primary process and before the party convention; during the convention or after the convention; or before or after people vote in November. What happens if a vacancy occurs during the primary process? While Trump and Biden are in total command of the respective races to be the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, that process will play out between now and June as states conduct primaries and caucuses and assign delegates based on the results. If a vacancy on either side happens before most of those primaries were to occur, it’s possible that another candidate could emerge and rack up some delegates. But since filing deadlines have already passed for many primaries, it’s unlikely any single candidate, other than Trump or Biden, could rack up enough delegates to win the nomination before party conventions this summer. It is, however, possible that states could decide to delay their primaries, according to Elaine Kamarck , a member of the Democratic National Committee rules committee and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied the issue. Republicans will hold their convention in Milwaukee in July, and Democrats will hold theirs just to the south in Chicago in August. Most delegates will have been awarded by the end of March. Biden has not faced serious opposition in the Democratic primary, has won every delegate at stake so far and needs to win at least 1,968 of 3,934 to secure the nomination on the first ballot of voting. On the Republican side, Trump has won every contest so far and ultimately needs 1,215 of 2,429 delegates. His top rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, is far behind Trump in the delegate race. What if a vacancy occurs after the primaries and before or during the convention? If the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would likely decide the party’s nominee on the convention floor. That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. There would be a messy political battle in every state over who would get to be a delegate (if the vacancy happened before many of those people were chosen) and then who they would ultimately support. Even people who did not run primary campaigns could ultimately be considered. You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to be on the ballot if, for some reason, Biden left the race. At the same time, given Haley’s weakness in primaries, it seems unlikely that Republicans would coalesce around her if Trump was unable to run. On the Democratic side, there would also be another group to consider: the “superdelegates,” a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can’t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they’re free to vote on subsequent ballots. Has anything like this ever happened before? The modern primary and caucus system evolved only in recent generations as voters demanded more involvement in the nominating process. The election that sparked change was in 1968, when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run after an embarrassing finish in New Hampshire’s primary. Johnson won, but just barely. When he dropped out of the presidential race, it set off a chaotic dash to replace him. One candidate who jumped in the race, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Los Angeles just after winning the California primary, creating the difficult question of who his delegates should support. The ultimate Democratic winner that year, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, amassed his delegates in states that did not conduct primaries, securing enough support to win the nomination. Violence on the streets of Chicago around the convention marred the event and helped inspire the system of primaries and caucuses we have today where voters pick presidential candidates through delegates bound to support a specific candidate. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party’s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrats – The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership. Republicans – If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth Congressional Research Service memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party’s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party’s nominee. Neither party, according to CRS, requires that the presidential candidate’s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, but that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health). The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern’s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/south-carolina-trump-haley-voters/index.html,"Pawleys Island, South Carolina CNN — Joy Rendulic was hesitant when her husband first suggested a move to South Carolina. Then she visited a small ice cream shop for sale near the spectacular coast of this barrier island town. Rendulic cashed in her 401(k) to buy it, and left Erie, Pennsylvania, behind. “God brought me here,” Rendulic told us during a break at Island Treats ice cream shop. “I thought I was doing what I was supposed to be doing for the rest of my life, and he had a different plan. We think we are in control. But we’re not.” The big move was in 2016. Nikki Haley was the governor then, and newcomer Rendulic was impressed. “Yes, she was a very good governor,” Rendulic said. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, in December 2023. Carlos Barria/Reuters/File Related article CNN Poll: Most Americans want verdict on Trump election subversion charges before 2024 vote Donald Trump won her vote for president that same year, again in 2020 and will once more when Trump and Haley square off in the South Carolina GOP presidential primary this month. “I totally believe that God has assigned him to this position,” Rendulic said of Trump.  “That is my true belief.” We ask what happened in 2020. “That was a mess,” Rendulic said. “That was so illegal. Some improper cheating happening to the voting procedures.” We mention all the recounts and court cases Trump lost, including cases decided by judges Trump appointed, that upheld now-President Joe Biden’s victory. “I think so many people hate Trump,” she said. “I just know there was a whole lot of cheating.” There is no evidence of that, but Rendulic is adamant. So we ask, if it was God’s plan for Trump to be president, why would God let that happen? The answer is halting. “What happened is what happened. And I believe Trump is coming again.” Rendulic represents an important slice of the Trump base: for Trump no matter what. These voters echo his false claims about rigged elections and bogus investigations and they stand by Trump even when he does things counter to their priorities. You find a lot of them in South Carolina, one reason Trump consistently leads the primary polls despite Haley’s home state status. Rendulic, for example, lists abortion – or the “right to life,” as she puts it – as the reason her last vote for a Democrat for president was Jimmy Carter. But she offers no criticism of Trump when we point out he has recently criticized some state abortion restrictions as too harsh and has warned it could be a losing issue for Republicans. “I haven’t thought about that too much, probably,” Rendulic said. “I want it to be right to life.” No doubt Trump gets her vote. “He’s even more ready now and very, very intelligent, cares a lot about this country,” she said. “Wants to do what is right.” Looking for a tough border ‘fix’ from Trump Billy Pierce is another piece of the Trump comeback puzzle. He has lived in Hartsville – about two hours inland from the South Carolina coast – all his 70 years except for a stint in the Navy. Pierce says he was drawn to Trump in 2016 for the same reason he backed Ross Perot in 1992. “I wanted a non-career politician in there that would do, would run it like a company,” Pierce said in an interview in the garage office where he organizes his part-time consulting work. Pierce sees Biden as too unwilling to stand up to the Democratic left and has fond memories of the pre-Covid economy during the Trump administration. “We didn’t have the high inflation,” he said. “We didn’t have the high interest rates.” Pierce is not an election denier. He does believe it was wrong that many states adopted new voting rules during the 2020 pandemic, but said Trump should have honored the results once all his challenges were exhausted. Nor is Pierce a fan of the former president’s toxic tone. “If he’d just shut up and, you know, got off Twitter and that kind of stuff, he’d have made a great president,” Pierce said. He called himself a likely Trump voter in the primary and described the choice between Trump and Haley as “the lesser of two evils.” Billy Pierce talks to John King in Hartsville, South Carolina. CNN But Pierce is very much in line with Trump on policy matters. “He’s going to fix the things I need him to fix,” Pierce said, listing the border as his top priority. “Shut it down,” is Pierce’s desire, though he agrees with Trump that congressional Republicans should not pass a border package before the November election – even if it would slow the flow of illegal border crossings. “This is a Democratic ploy” designed to help Biden, Pierce said. He offers a suggestion on what he would do at the border, based on his time in the military. “Have us put up razor wire,” Pierce said. “I have no problem with putting up two rows and mining the other. So if they come in, you tell them it is mined. You put signs out there that says it’s mined.” He balances such tough talk with a personal story about his daughter adopting two children from Guatemala. Be tough at the border now, Pierce said, and then conversations about more legal immigration would be possible. “It needs to be done the right way.” From sending a message to DC to sending a message to the next generation Craig Thomas lived in Tennessee when Trump caught his attention in 2016. Thomas describes himself as “conservative, some areas libertarian.” Trump, he thought then, was an outsider – and a vote for him would send a message to Washington. “It was like, alright, like this is good,” said Thomas. “Let’s blow some things up.” Now, Thomas lives in Charleston and is voting for Haley – to send a message to his two children. Craig Thomas talks to John King in Charleston, South Carolina. CNN He is tired of all the personal attacks and all the anger and wants a president who is also a role model. Haley, he said, “brings very similar policy positions, but definitely without the drama.” One recent MAGA conspiracy theory hit too close to home. “I don’t think there’s any sort of a crazy conspiracy between the NFL and Taylor Swift and everything else just showing up for a Biden coronation,” Thomas said. “How do I look at my daughter, who is a huge Taylor Swift fan, and this guy just attacking Taylor Swift, just because she is going to support another candidate, right.” “And other things like that. And having those conversations with them. It does matter. And it does matter who you support.” Trump as a religion Charleston is rich with both Revolutionary and Civil War history, a place where you can still ride a horse-drawn carriage down a cobblestone street. It is more affluent, more educated and less Trumpy than most of South Carolina. “But there is quite a bit of talk about Trump, even here,” Thomas said. Mark Sanford is out of politics because of that – because of the reach of the Trump Republican revolution. Sanford served in the House representing a Charleston-area district, and then was the state’s two-term Republican governor just before Haley was first elected in 2010. Sanford won his old House seat back in 2013, but then lost the Republican primary in 2018 because he was a sharp critic of then-President Trump’s fiscal policies, and sometimes of his tone. “I would say, ‘Well I’m for Trump in this area, but I’m against in these different areas.’ But people didn’t want nuance. They want: ‘Are you for or against him.’” Sanford wouldn’t directly answer when asked how he will vote in this month’s primary. But he did offer this: “I’ve never voted for Trump so far. I know that I’m not voting for him this time. I’ll let you read the tea leaves from that.” John King talks to Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman from the Charleston area. CNN Sanford agrees when Haley goes after Trump for all the “chaos,” and especially when she highlights the deficit spending of the Trump years. Yet he expects a big Trump win in South Carolina, because the GOP electorate is so different now from when he was first elected. “What has traditionally worked in GOP politics isn’t so much working these days,” he said in an interview at his home in the Charleston suburb of Mount Pleasant. “He became sort of a proxy litmus test for ‘Are you for or against the system,’” Sanford said. “I’ve seen this erosion,” Sanford said. “Sort of Perot movement to Tea Party to Trump. It’s metastasized in ever aggressive forms. And what started out as a lot of well meaning Americans saying, ‘Look, we’ve got to do something about politicians doing what they said they were going to do’ (has evolved) into something much more strident. … It is their religion. I mean, I, I don’t know how else to explain it.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/fact-check-trump-new-york-hush-money/index.html,"Washington CNN — Former President Donald Trump , now the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, made false and evidence-free claims to reporters on Thursday before and after he attended a Manhattan court hearing in the hush money criminal case against him. Here is a fact check of some of Trump’s remarks. Trump’s court attendance and campaign schedule Before entering the courtroom, Trump claimed that the hush money case against him is “election interference.” He also argued that it is literally interfering with his ability to campaign in South Carolina in advance of the February 24 Republican presidential primary there. “How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again – this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said. Trump was even more explicit in comments after leaving the courtroom later in the morning, saying, “So instead of being in South Carolina and other states, campaigning, I’m stuck here.” Facts First : Trump wasn’t “stuck” in the courthouse in New York on Thursday. In fact, he was not required to attend any part of the hearing, since Judge Juan Merchan had waived his pretrial appearances in the hush money case . Rather, Trump voluntarily chose to appear at the hearing after considering instead attending a Thursday hearing in Georgia that is related to the charges he faces there . And he had not been scheduled to be in South Carolina on Thursday even before he made the decision to attend the New York hearing; his next scheduled campaign appearance in the state is next week. His next rally after the Thursday hearing is a Saturday event in Michigan . Trump was not planning to fly to South Carolina after the New York hearing. He was planning to fly back to Florida, where he lives. Though he has appeared only occasionally at court hearings, Trump has spent little time campaigning in South Carolina so far in the 2024 campaign. His two rallies in the state in the past week were his first there in 2024 . Biden and the hush money case Before entering the courtroom, Trump claimed that President Joe Biden’s White House is running the hush money case that was brought against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg . “What it is, is election interference. It’s being run by Joe Biden’s White House. His top person was placed here in order to make sure everything goes right,” Trump said. He continued, “His top person, Colangelo, and some others have been placed into the DA’s office to make sure they do a good job of election interference.” Facts First: There is no basis for Trump’s claims. First, there is no evidence that Biden’s White House has any role in running the Manhattan district attorney’s case. Second, there is no evidence that the White House nor the Biden administration had anything to do with senior Justice Department official Matthew Colangelo’s decision to leave the department and join the district attorney’s office in 2022 as senior counsel to Bragg . Colangelo and Bragg knew each other before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney. Colangelo and Bragg previously worked at the same time in the office of New York’s state attorney general, where Colangelo investigated Trump’s charity and Trump’s financial practices and was involved in bringing various lawsuits against the Trump administration. On a minor point, Colangelo was never Biden’s very top official at the Justice Department. Colangelo served as acting associate attorney general in the first months of the Biden administration in early 2021 and then as principal deputy associate attorney general. As acting associate attorney general, he was third in command of the department. Justice Department prosecutors declined both in the middle and at the end of Trump’s presidential term to pursue federal charges against Trump over the hush money case, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig reported in a 2023 book . Honig reported that federal prosecutors in New York decided against pursuing charges in 2018 on account of longstanding Justice Department guidance that a sitting president can’t be indicted. Honig reported that in January 2021, just before Trump left office that month, federal prosecutors in New York held discussions about possibly reviving the case but again decided not to seek an indictment. Violent crime in New York Before entering the courtroom Trump denounced the hush money case against him and said, “This is not a crime. And when you look what’s going on outside [inaudible; in or on] the streets, where violent crime is at an all-time high, I think it’s a very, very – it’s a great double standard.” Trump has made similar claims about crime levels in New York City on various previous occasions while attacking the cases he faces in New York – and CNN has repeatedly debunked them. Facts First : Trump’s claim remains false. Violent crime is nowhere near a record high in either Manhattan in particular or New York City as a whole. Both Manhattan and New York City have experienced massive declines in crime since the record levels of the early 1990s. New York City publishes crime statistics on its website, so the facts are easy to find. In 1990, when the city set its all-time record for murders, there were 503 recorded murders in Manhattan, which is one of the city’s five boroughs. In 2023, Manhattan recorded 73 murders – a decline of about 85% from 1990. Manhattan is also way below record levels for other kinds of violent crime. For example, Manhattan recorded 252 rapes in 2023, down about 63% from the 689 in 1990, and 3,841 robberies in 2023, down about 86% from the 26,907 in 1990. The declines are similarly large for New York City as a whole . The city recorded 391 murders in 2023, down about 83% from the 2,262 in 1990; 1,455 rapes in 2023, down about 53% from the 3,126 in 1990; and 16,910 robberies in 2023, down about 83% from the 100,280 in 1990."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/fact-check-trump-nato/index.html,"Washington CNN — For a third straight presidential election campaign, former President Donald Trump is being serially inaccurate about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance. Trump caused a transatlantic uproar this weekend by claiming at a Saturday campaign rally that he had once told the president of a “big” NATO country that if that country didn’t pay its “bills,” he would not protect the country from a Russian invasion and would even “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want.” Trump’s incendiary remarks contained a familiar false claim. His assertion about NATO allies supposedly having failed to pay “bills” is not true, as fact-checkers at CNN and elsewhere have pointed out for years. And Trump has for years made a variety of other false claims about spending by NATO and its members. Here is a fact check of five of his repeated statements. Spending by NATO members Trump has long claimed that various NATO members have failed to pay their “ bills ,” “ dues ” or “ NATO fees ,” that they “ owe us a tremendous amount of money ” or that they “ owe NATO billions of dollars .” Facts First: All of these Trump claims are false. While a majority of NATO members do not meet the alliance’s target of each member spending a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, the 2% target is a “guideline ” that does not create bills, debts or legal obligations if it is not met. In fact, the guideline doesn’t require payments to NATO or the US at all. Rather, it simply requires each country to spend on their own defense programs. When Trump was president, the guideline was written in forgiving language that made clear that it was not a firm commitment. That version of the guideline, created at a NATO summit in Wales in 2014, said members that had yet to reach 2% would “aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade with a view to meeting their NATO Capability Targets and filling NATO’s capability shortfalls.” In other words, the members that were below 2% in 2014 didn’t even have to promise to hit the target by 2024 – simply to make an effort to do so by then. NATO does require members to make direct contributions to fund the organization’s own operations. But there is no sign that members have failed to make those contributions, which constitute a tiny fraction of the allies’ defense spending, and Trump has made clear that his talk of debts  is about the 2% guideline. Stephen Saideman , the Paterson Chair in International Affairs at Carleton University in Canada, said in a Monday email that the word “inaccurate really does not cover Trump’s protection racket/country club perception of dues owed to the US.” “The money, as you and everyone else knows, is not sent from member states to the US or NATO (although there is a common fund that pays for the buildings in Brussels and elsewhere but it is not that much money and is not the focus of the 2% discussions). The commitment is for each country to spend enough on their own militaries – 2% of GDP, 20% of defense spending on equipment – so that the alliance as a whole is capable and can credibly deter Russia and do whatever else the alliance agrees to,” Saideman said. As of 2023, 11 of 30 NATO members were meeting the 2% target, NATO estimates show . That was up from three members in 2014. Erwan Lagadec , a research professor at George Washington University’s ﻿Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, noted in a Monday email that NATO members agreed to firmer language related to the 2% target in 2023, formally declaring that “we make an enduring commitment to invest at least 2% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually on defence.” Lagadec said that “arguably for the first time the Allies HAVE made a hard commitment to reaching 2% (indeed, to reaching at least 2%) rather than merely ‘trying to get there if possible.’” He noted, though, that even this stronger declaration “doesn’t provide a deadline” to hit 2%. Regardless, it will not create actual debts to the US or NATO. NATO members’ spending before Trump took office As president, Trump claimed that NATO members’ spending had declined “every single year” until he took office in 2017. He sometimes claimed there had been 15 , 16 or 18 years of declines. Facts First : Trump’s claims that NATO members’ spending had declined every year until he took office are false. Official NATO data show that non-US members’ defense spending increased in each of the two years prior to Trump’s presidency – by 1.6% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016. The increases came after NATO members recommitted to the 2%-of-GDP guideline at the 2014 summit in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region . Non-US members’ defense spending increases in each year of the Trump era were bigger than their increases in 2015 and 2016 – the increases were 5.9% in 2017, 4.3% in 2018, 3.6% in 2019 and 4.6% in 2020 – and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg gave Trump at least partial credit . But Trump is wrong when he claims he reversed a downward trend. “If you look at the year-on-year data, the turning point away from the nadir of European defense spending happened in 2014, pre-Trump, and clearly due to Crimea,” Lagadec said. Saideman said that while it’s possible he is undervaluing Trump’s impact because he generally dislikes Trump, “Putin deserves most of the credit for defense spending increases in Europe.” He said, “Everyone was cutting their defense budgets after the 2008 economic crisis and as countries started pulling out of Afghanistan, and all that changed with the seizure of Crimea.” And he argued that any increases sparked by Trump are likely less about his efforts to cajole allies than about those allies’ concerns about the US no longer keeping its commitments given what has sounded from Trump like “genuine hostility to the alliance and to the allies.” Under President Joe Biden, non-US NATO members increased their defense spending by 2.8% in 2021 and an estimated 2.0% in 2022, then by an estimated 8.3% in 2023. That large 2023 spike was “clearly in reaction to the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine” in 2022, Lagadec said. The US share of NATO spending As president, Trump repeatedly claimed that, before him, the US was “ paying for 100% of NATO ” or “ paying close to 100% .” Facts First : Trump’s claims are false. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members – a large majority, but not “100%” or “close to 100%.” And Trump’s claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover NATO’s organizational expenses and are set based on each country’s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016 . The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 68% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany; Lagadec said the US share was reduced from 22% “to placate Trump” and is a “sweetheart deal” given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance’s total GDP . What previous presidents told NATO members As president, Trump repeatedly claimed that before he pressured NATO members to increase their defense spending, US presidents did not even ask them to do so. He singled out former President Barack Obama in his comments at the rally on Saturday. After referring to NATO members Trump said he pressured himself, he continued: “And then I hear that they like Obama better. They should like Obama better. You know why? Because he didn’t ask for anything.” Facts First : Trump’s claims are false. Both Obama and his predecessor, President George W. Bush , repeatedly pressed other NATO members to spend more on defense, though t heir public language was less confrontational than Trump’s. At a news conference in Belgium in 2014, Obama said , “ If we’ve got collective defense, it means that everybody has got to chip in. And I have had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO – not all, but many. The trend lines have been going down.” In a speech in Germany in 2016, Obama said , “Every NATO member should be contributing its full share – 2% of GDP – towards our common security, something that doesn’t always happen. And I’ll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense.” In a speech to Canada’s Parliament in 2016, he said , “As your ally and as your friend, let me say that we’ll be more secure when every NATO member, including Canada, contributes its full share to our common security.” In a speech in the Czech Republic in 2002, before a NATO summit, Bush said that every NATO member needs to make a military contribution to the alliance, and “f or some allies, this will require higher defense spending.” Bush and top administration officials continued for the rest of his presidency to push for increased spending. While visiting Romania in 2008, Bush said , “Building a strong NATO alliance also requires a strong European defense capacity. So at this summit, I will encourage our European partners to increase their defense investments to support both NATO and EU operations.” The cost of NATO’s headquarters While criticizing NATO both during and after his presidency, Trump has claimed that NATO spent $3 billion on its headquarters building in Belgium. Facts First: Trump’s $3 billion figure is not close to accurate. NATO told CNN in 2020 that the headquarters building was constructed for a sum under the approved budget of 1.178 billion euro, or about $1.27 billion at Monday exchange rates – certainly an expensive facility, but less than half what Trump has claimed."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/politics/kfile-whatley-promoted-false-election-fraud-claims/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump and his allies are pushing to replace the chair of the Republican National Committee with North Carolina’s party leader who promoted 2020 presidential election lies and supported using the courts to overturn the results. Michael Whatley, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, shared false claims that Republican observers were prevented from accessing polling locations and repeatedly said Democratic cities in swing states were engaged in “massive fraud,” a CNN KFile review of Whatley’s comments following the election found. Whatley, who has since acknowledged Joe Biden is the country’s legitimate president, currently serves as general counsel at the RNC overseeing litigation and what the organization calls its “election integrity” efforts. His elevation to RNC chair could give Trump a loyalist more willing to devote resources to pursue future voter fraud claims in court should they arise. One reason why Trump soured on Ronna McDaniel, the current chair, was his perception she should have done more to fight for his candidacy in 2020, CNN reported. Like many Republicans, Whatley publicly backed Trump’s voter fraud claims on multiple occasions following the 2020 election. “Regardless of how these lawsuits come out around the country with the presidential race we do know that there was massive fraud that took place,” Whatley said in one late November 2020 interview on local North Carolina radio. “We know that it took place in places like Milwaukee and Detroit and Philadelphia.” There is no evidence of massive fraud in any of those cities or around the country as Republican election officials and Trump-appointed former Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged . Trump and his supporters filed more than 60 cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one. Whatley, a former Senate staffer and one-time lobbyist focused on energy-related issues, said in a statement to CNN he believed pandemic related changes to voting laws weakened safeguards against voter fraud. “There is no question that changes to the 2020 election process which weakened safeguards on absentee and mail-in votes in some states led to distrust by many across the Country. I firmly believe in having proper safeguards in place to ensure that it is easy to vote and hard to cheat.“ Whatley is one of two candidates Trump and his allies are supporting to take over the RNC. The other is Drew McKissick, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. Trump turned on McDaniel over the poor finances and management of the RNC at a time when the organization is facing one of its worst fundraising years in a decade. CNN reported Tuesday that McDaniel is planning to step down at the end of the month. Despite Trump’s preferred picks, only RNC members can choose to elect the new chairman. False claims about the 2020 election In his capacity as chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party in the days following the 2020 election, Whatley parroted much of Trump’s false election claims. One day before the election was called for Biden, Whatley echoed false claims about Republican poll watchers being barred from observation. “There’s also issues [in] surrounding states like Michigan and Pennsylvania where they’re not allowing Republican observers into the polling location to watch the voting,” Whatley said. “When we have instances of voter fraud, then obviously if those are widespread enough to be able to, you know, affect the outcome, you’re gonna have litigation that’s gonna deal with those.” One week following the 2020 election, Whatley called it alarming that the results would be determined in court but said it was the strategy needed for Trump to secure victory. At the time, there were recounts occurring in major swing states – all of which would affirm Biden’s victory. “I think that what we’re seeing in Georgia, especially with the hand recount,” he said on local North Carolina radio . “What we’re seeing in Arizona where we’re gonna have a recount out there as well – And then it’s gonna basically put states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin into court. It really is kind of scary proposition to think that you’re gonna have a court overturn some of those results. But that’s really the plan.” “And I get asked every single day by a reporter, why do you keep alleging that there’s fraud out there?” he continued. “And it’s like, all you have to do is look at the stories that we’re seeing out of Philadelphia, the Detroit area, we’re seeing out of Milwaukee, egregious violations of election law. And there’s no question why it puts these elections at risk.” At the time, Trump and his allies were inundating the public with unfounded allegations of fraud in Democratic cities. They made baseless claims of excluded poll watchers, fake reports of suitcases filled with fraudulent ballots, bogus allegations of bussed-in ballots from New York to swing states and false assertions that Philadelphia had more ballots than voters. Whatley pointed to the contested 2000 presidential election recount in Florida, where he served on the Bush recount team during the legal disputes between George W. Bush and Al Gore, to argue the election was far from over. Ultimately, the Supreme Court intervened and stopped the recount, effectively deciding the election in Bush’s favor. “We’re not done in the presidential. We’re not done at all,” he added, referring to the 2020 election, in the interview. Condemned January 6th - but suggested not done by “Republican voters” In an interview on January 2, 2021, Whatley resigned himself to Biden being President – but said objections to the election were important to discuss the claims of fraud. “I think the fact that we’re likely to have the outcome be that Joe Biden is going to get certified and sworn in, does not mean that these protests are irrelevant,” he said . “It is absolutely critical that we have a national dialogue on election integrity. What we saw in places like Milwaukee and Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Phoenix is really very, very troubling.” Following the riot on January 6, 2021, Whatley condemned those who broke into the Capitol building in interviews. “The actions of these violent protestors is completely unjustified and unacceptable. There is no rationale to excuse this assault on the foundations of our Democracy,” he said in a tweet since deleted. In an interview, Whatley described himself as “appalled” by January 6th riot, but said the Republican Party as “a whole” was not “complicit” in what happened. “Most of the people that have been arrested were not necessarily Republican voters,” Whatley said in February 2021. “There’s certainly Trump supporters in there, but we’ve also seen others and we’re gonna unequivocally condemn those actions. In the aftermath of the January 6th some have sought to deflect blame for the riot by alleging Republican partisans weren’t the primarily force behind it, though subsequent investigations have shown that those arrested were mostly Trump supporters. In another interview in February 2021 , Whatley acknowledged Biden as “legitimately” elected President of the United States. “I was a member of the Electoral College, and I proudly cast my vote for President Trump. But the Electoral college voted. And a majority was for Joe Biden and he is the President of the United.” Following Biden’s inauguration, Whatley attacked the impeachment of former President Trump and in March referred to the Republican Party as “Donald Trump’s party,” at a local event."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — As the two-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, it feels like everyone has been sucked into a bizarro world. ► Two years ago, in February 2022, Tucker Carlson was a Fox News host, still adjacent to mainstream US politics. ► US support for Ukraine seemed ironclad and unflappable as Russia invaded. ► Russian President Vladimir Putin was about to be isolated worldwide as a pariah. ► Elon Musk would soon commit to helping Ukraine with his Starlink satellite internet system. ► Former President Donald Trump was still plotting his way out of the political wilderness, his presence rarely felt by most of the country. What a difference two years makes Some developments this week: ► Putin got a platform, thanks to a softball interview by Carlson, who was banished from Fox News last year and has turned to Twitter, the platform Musk bought and renamed X, to spew right-wing conspiracy theories. ► American aid for Ukraine is in real question as US politicians, led by Republicans in the House of Representatives, question the investment. Note: When Trump helped kill a bipartisan border policy bill this week, it also put Ukraine aid sought for months by President Joe Biden in jeopardy. ► Trump’s emergence from the wilderness is complete. He has all but erased any question he will be the Republican presidential nominee for the third time and is plotting his return to the White House. The Pentagon, by the way, is now paying Musk’s SpaceX for Ukraine to use Starlink. Video Ad Feedback Russia expert says this is what Putin hoped to get from Carlson interview 02:06 - Source: CNN A propaganda broadcast on X Carlson was walked on by Putin during the interview in Moscow. CNN’s Oliver Darcy called it a “propaganda victory” for Putin. From Darcy: Instead of pressing Putin on the many topics at hand, including credible accusations Russia has committed war crimes and the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Carlson allowed the autocrat a free lane to manipulate the public and tell his version of history, no matter how deceptive it may have been. At times, between the airing of grievances, Putin appeared to school Carlson on historical events as the host looked on in bewilderment. Or to put it more plainly, Carlson provided Putin a platform to spread his propaganda to a global audience with little to no scrutiny of his claims. In one notable exchange, Carlson did push back on the idea that Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia since last March, is a US spy. According to CNN’s reporting, Russia rejected an offer to exchange a large number of Russian nationals detained abroad for both Gershkovich and another American, Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since 2018. Putin told Carlson that perhaps Gershkovich could be exchanged for Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel in Russia’s domestic spying service who was convicted for murdering a former Chechen fighter in Berlin in broad daylight in 2019. CNN’s Nathan Hodge, Katharina Krebs and Helen Regan have more details . They also fact-check Carlson on his assertion that US media organizations have not tried to interview Putin. From their report: In fact, journalists have repeatedly been requesting interviews with Putin, but the Russian president had declined to grant access. And Putin not only has declined to participate in interviews with the free press, but over the past two years he has waged a war against the media, locking up journalists , fining Big Tech companies for hosting “fake” information about the Ukraine invasion, and pushing through censorship laws that clamp down on news organizations. Video Ad Feedback Amanpour pushes back on Tucker Carlson's claim about Putin interview 02:13 - Source: CNN Putin, despite the free platform from Carlson, still faces isolation in the West. The CNN reporters note the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin regarding an alleged scheme to take Ukrainian children to Russia. And there was a new call Thursday for Putin to face a war crimes inquiry for Russia’s assault on the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which killed thousands. The reporters also used the word “revanchist,” which I had to look up and which perfectly describes Putin’s warped view of history and his obsession with occupying Ukraine. From Merriam-Webster: (re·​vanch·​ist) of or relating to a policy designed to recover lost territory or status. Shakeup in Ukraine Meantime, there are major developments in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky this week replaced his top military commander, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. From CNN’s report : The president’s move follows tensions between Zelensky and his hugely popular military chief after the failure of Ukraine’s much-vaunted counteroffensive, and with Ukraine facing a renewed Russian onslaught, manpower and ammunition shortages, and US aid stalled in Congress. Major choices for Americans But among the many, concrete choices Americans face in November, assuming the presidential election is between Trump and Biden, is how the US president will approach Putin. Biden has his built his presidency around the idea of a worldwide struggle between democracies and autocracies. Trump frequently expresses admiration for autocrats and his frustration with democratic alliances like NATO. Ukraine funding has run dry The Pentagon has essentially exhausted the money Congress allocated for Ukraine over the past two years. It’s unclear when more might be on the way, particularly after the proposal to tie US border policy to Ukraine funding met its end this week. In the Senate, there is support for Ukraine aid. A bipartisan group of senators on Thursday cleared a 60-vote threshold to move toward a $95 billion aid bill for Ukraine and Israel. One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, plans to use arcane procedural tactics to stall a final vote for days . Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, pushed back against criticism from right-wing lawmakers that the money is charity for Ukraine. Most of the funds would be spent on production of military hardware in the US, he said. “This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy and demonstrating to our allies and adversaries alike that we’re serious about exercising American strength,” he said on the Senate floor on Friday. The House is a more formidable roadblock to additional Ukraine funding. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has not ruled out the idea of approving a Ukraine bill, either as a stand-alone proposition or in conjunction with aid to Israel. But he has certainly not endorsed it either. Johnson, along with other Republicans, has demanded more transparency and accountability for how the money is spent. And to get more aid passed into law, he would likely need Democratic votes – which will anger hard-line Republicans who have the power to oust him."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/senate-democrats-biden-election-analysis/index.html,"CNN — For Senate Democrats, 2024 is the year of living dangerously. In this fall’s Senate elections, Democrats will be defending more seats in precarious political terrain than in any other election during the 2020s. That list of challenging elections this year includes the final three Senate seats Democrats hold in states that voted for Donald Trump in 2020, and five more in states that President Joe Biden won by 3 percentage points or less. Meanwhile, Republicans this year are not defending any Senate seats in states that voted against Trump in 2020, or preferred him by 3 points or less. That math underlines the stakes for Democrats in Biden improving his position in the key swing states by November. One of the most powerful trends of modern Senate elections is that it has become exceedingly difficult for candidates in either party to win seats in states that usually vote the other way for president. The Senate Democrats running in difficult electoral terrain might break that trend this fall. Yet if they can’t, Biden’s fate in November could determine control of the Senate not only in 2025, but for years thereafter. A strong recovery by Biden in which he wins most of the key swing states could position Democrats to remain competitive in the battle for Senate control through the remainder of this decade, even if they narrowly lose the majority in November. But if Biden loses most of the swing states, Democrats could fall into a Senate deficit too large to realistically overcome for years — especially because the party has so few plausible opportunities to flip seats now held by the GOP. “If the bottom were to drop out for Biden, Democrats could lose the Senate for a long time,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the political newsletter “Sabato’s Crystal Ball,” which is published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. That prospect has enormous implications not only for the passage of legislation but also for the composition of the federal courts, especially the Supreme Court. Four of the Supreme Court justices will be older than 70 by 2028. Even if Biden holds the White House in 2024, and a vacancy arises, a durable Republican Senate majority might refuse to fill any of those seats — just as then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did while Barack Obama was president in 2016. “You can imagine Supreme Court seats going unfilled for years,” Kondik said. The default position for the Senate in the 21st century has been for small and fleeting majorities. In the 12 congressional sessions since 2001, one party or the other has reached 55 Senate seats only three times. By comparison, one party or the other won a majority of 55 or more Senate seats seven times in the 10 sessions from 1980 to 2000. Smaller majorities, not surprisingly, have proved more difficult to defend: In this century, control of the Senate has already flipped in the elections of 2002, 2006, 2014 and 2020. The principal reason the chamber has become so closely divided is the growing correlation between how states vote for president and how they vote for the Senate. That has limited the number of Senate seats each side can win absent unusual circumstances. Through the late 20th century, it was common for voters to split their tickets by electing senators from one party while voting for the presidential nominee of the other. After the 1984 election, for instance, Democrats still held about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for Ronald Reagan in both of his winning presidential campaigns. But now the alignment between presidential and Senate outcomes has become nearly complete. Heading into the 2024 election, Republicans hold 47 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Trump in 2020. Democrats, in turn, hold 48 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Biden last time. This surface equivalence in the two parties’ position in the Senate, though, masks a deeper divergence that largely explains the risk to Democrats this year. While Biden and Trump each won 25 states in 2020, Biden won far more of them by very narrow margins. As a result, Senate Democrats are much more dependent than Republicans on states that lean their way only slightly in the presidential contest. In 2020, Biden won three states by less than a single percentage point: Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. He won three others by less than 3 percentage points: Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan. Democrats now hold 11 of the 12 Senate seats from those six highly competitive states. (Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is the only Republican senator from these states.) President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally in Las Vegas on February 4, 2024. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images By contrast, among the 25 states that backed Trump, North Carolina — where Republicans hold both Senate seats — was the only one Trump carried by less than 3 percentage points. Even extending the net to states Trump won by less than 5 percentage points brings in only Florida, where Republicans also hold both Senate seats. This contrast creates a huge disparity between the parties. Democrats now hold 14 inherently vulnerable Senate seats: their three from the states Trump won in 2020, and their 11 in the states Biden won only narrowly. For Republicans the total is at most six: two in states that Biden won in 2020, and four in states that Trump won narrowly, even with Florida included. “When you have so many states where it is now inconceivable that they could go the other way, Democrats always have to get a straight flush,” said Michael Podhorzer , the former political director for the AFL-CIO. “They’ve got to run the table, because on the basis of what’s safe on either side in the Senate, or the Electoral College, they are at a huge disadvantage.” This year Democrats are defending five of their 11 seats in the states that Biden won by 3 points or less. That’s the biggest concentration of seats from those states Democrats must defend in any single election in this decade, from 2020 through 2028. This year’s Senate races in the narrow Biden states include Democratic incumbents Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, and Jacky Rosen in Nevada; also on the ballot is an open Democratic-held seat in Michigan (where the party is very likely to nominate Rep. Elissa Slotkin) and the Arizona seat held by Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sinema hasn’t indicated whether she will seek reelection, but Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is already running for the seat. (Democrats also face an unexpected challenge in Maryland — a state that leans much more reliably toward them in presidential elections — after GOP former Gov. Larry Hogan last week said he would run for the open seat there.) In addition, Democrats this year must defend all three of their remaining Senate seats in the states that voted for Trump in 2020. That includes incumbents Jon Tester in Montana, Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and the open seat being vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin in West Virginia. Neither of the two remaining Senate Republicans in states that Biden won last time (Susan Collins in Maine and Johnson in Wisconsin) are up this year; nor are either of the GOP senators from North Carolina, the state Trump won by his smallest margin. Both parties agree the open West Virginia seat is virtually guaranteed to flip to the GOP. Tester and Brown both have strong personal brands, but Biden is almost certain to lose their states, and possibly by substantial margins. If he does, Brown and Tester could survive only by breaking a nearly inviolate recent pattern in presidential election years. In 2016, for the first time ever, every Senate race was won by the same party that carried the presidential contest in that state. In 2020, every Senate race again followed the presidential outcome — except in Maine, where Collins won reelection despite Biden’s victory there. This pattern proved especially frustrating to Democrats, who raised enormous sums in 2020 for Senate candidates in Republican-leaning states such as Kentucky, South Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Montana and Texas. Yet when Trump comfortably carried those states in November, all of those Democratic Senate candidates lost as well. A man votes on Election Day on November 3, 2020, in Charleston, South Carolina. Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images This year, with West Virginia likely already gone, if either Brown or Tester loses, it would be very difficult for Democrats to maintain their Senate majority into 2025. The only Republican senators they might plausibly oust to offset those losses are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas. Democrats have recruited strong challengers to each of them, but both of those races clearly lean toward the GOP, especially in a presidential election year. But if Democrats can hold down their Senate losses to some (or even all) of their three seats in the states Trump won in 2020, they would emerge with a deficit small enough to overcome in upcoming elections. The real long-term risk for the party this November is losing several of their Senate seats in the states Biden narrowly carried last time. (Hogan’s bid in Maryland adds a wild card, but the probability that Biden wins Maryland will likely leave Hogan as an underdog despite his personal popularity.) If Democrats lose Senate seats in the narrow Biden states, they simply have very few places on the map to replace them, given the parties’ patterns of support. It’s that prospect that has led the Democratic data analyst David Shor to warn for years that if the party doesn’t perform well in the 2024 presidential election, the GOP could seize control of the Senate for a sustained period. Shor would not comment on the Democrats’ Senate situation, but many other analysts see a dangerous convergence: The party must defend an unusually large number of seats in terrain that is highly contested at the presidential level precisely as Biden is struggling in polls against Trump. “There is a real downside risk that if the presidential election goes poorly, the Republicans could not only win the Senate but build something of a cushion that would be hard for Democrats to cut into in the near future,” Kondik said. Gene Ulm, a Republican pollster who has worked for many Senate candidates, agrees that what happens in the narrow Biden 2020 states this fall will cast a huge shadow on control of the Senate through the decade. If Republicans capture Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, he said, the reaction in the political world would not be “gosh, shock, alert the media,” he said. “It’s one thing for Republicans to recapture those states that have been habitually red,” Ulm said, but “if all of a sudden you have Republicans winning places that are historically purple,” that creates a very different situation going forward. The best-case scenario for Democrats is that Biden recovers enough to win most or all of the five battleground states where the party is also defending Senate seats. Many on both sides agree that it will be difficult for Republicans to flip any of those Democratic-held seats if Biden wins the state — with Arizona a possible exception if Sinema creates a three-way race. Of the Democrats running in the narrow Biden states, Casey in Pennsylvania and Baldwin in Wisconsin are probably best positioned to win even the president he loses their state, many in both parties agree. Brown and Tester also have deep roots that could allow them to survive Biden defeats as well. But in this era of greater party-line voting, it won’t be easy for any candidate to overcome such an undertow: Hardly any Senate Democrats in competitive races ran even 2 percentage points ahead of Biden’s vote share in 2020. Ulm sees two keys to the Senate outcomes in the competitive swing states. One is the choices in the Senate races by voters who back third-party presidential candidates out of distaste for both Biden and Trump, assuming they face each other again; it is very difficult at this point, Ulm said, to predict how those disaffected voters will vote in Senate (and House) races. For Ulm, the other key question is what happens with the voters who are slightly negative about Biden. He is confident Republican Senate candidates will romp among voters who strongly disapprove of Biden, as they did in 2022. But one reason Democrats blunted the anticipated 2022 red wave is their congressional and gubernatorial candidates ran unusually well among voters who only “somewhat disapproved” of Biden — largely because many of those voters considered the Trump-allied GOP alternatives too extreme. Electoral workers process ballots in Easton, Pennsylvania, on November 3, 2020. Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images That risk to the GOP remains. “The soft disapprovers are going to be a much more competitive constituency, just like 2022,” Ulm said. David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, notes that in the 2022 midterm election, Democrats won Senate races in most of these same battleground states, although exit polls showed substantial discontent with the economy and Biden’s performance then, too. “Senate campaigns are candidate versus candidate battles,” Bergstein said. “We have the superior candidates, and Republicans are putting forward candidates who have big flaws, who lost races before, or are facing the prospect of damaging primaries. Certainly a presidential cycle is different than a midterm, but the laws of Senate campaigns, where candidate quality matters, are still in effect.” Gary Jacobson, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of California at San Diego who specializes in Congress, said that given the fissures opening in each party’s coalition during the Trump era, no one should rule out the possibility that either side may develop new opportunities that reconfigure the Senate’s precarious balance. “This structural disadvantage the Democrats have is a real thing and it will make it an uphill battle for them to control the Senate for the foreseeable future,” Jacobson said. “But the foreseeable future is pretty short. Political configurations are not cut in stone.” Unless and until such a new political configuration emerges, both parties can realistically target many fewer Senate seats than they could even two decades ago. But the ceiling is clearly lower for Democrats than for Republicans. It leaves Democrats, even in good years, with achingly little margin for error to build a Senate majority. And unless Biden recovers more strength, 2024 may be very far from anything Democrats would call a good year."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/house-republicans-robert-hur/index.html,"House Republicans have reached out to special counsel Robert Hur to discuss having him testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee about his report on President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Hur’s report released last week did not charge the president with a crime, but it painted a picture of a forgetful commander in chief who failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information – a depiction that could hurt Biden politically and that Republicans have seized on. Hur has retained Bill Burck, who previously represented special counsel John Durham, as his personal attorney. While there is no date on the calendar, they are looking toward the end of February, one of the sources told CNN. The Justice Department declined to comment. House Republicans leading the impeachment inquiry also asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to turn over the transcript of the special counsel’s interview with the president in a new letter on Monday. The Republican committee chairs are also asking the Department of Justice to supply Congress with “any recordings, notes, or summaries” of the special counsel’s interview with the president. Beyond that, Republicans request the Justice Department turn over classified documents related to Ukraine as they continue to attempt to draw connections between Biden’s official actions as vice president and his son’s foreign business dealings at the time. “There is concern that President Biden may have retained sensitive documents related to specific countries involving his family’s foreign business dealings” House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, Oversight Chair James Comer, and Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith wrote in the letter. The two special counsels appointed during the Trump presidency, Robert Mueller and Durham, both testified to Congress once they submitted their reports to the Justice Department. After expressing some reluctance, Mueller agreed to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees in July 2019 about his investigation, delivering halting and stilted responses that mostly stuck to his report. The negotiations for Mueller’s appearance stretched out for weeks, ultimately leading to an agreement in which he appeared after he was subpoenaed. Last June, Durham testified to the House Judiciary Committee about his investigation and report into the FBI’s probe into Trump and Russia, and he spoke behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee. Hur’s special counsel report found that Biden willfully retained classified information, including top secret documents, and knew he was in possession of some documents as far back as 2017. He also shared some of that information with the ghostwriter of his 2017 memoir. The special counsel decided not to charge the president in the case – primarily because he found that nothing proved a willful intent by Biden to illegally hold onto classified information and the president cooperated with the investigation. Yet, in a politically damaging line of reasoning, Hur wrote that one reason Biden wasn’t going to be prosecuted was because he would present to a jury as an elderly man “with a poor memory.” Biden’s lawyers objected to the description – calling it “investigative excess” and accusing Hur of flouting Justice Department rules and norms. The report is sure to become an issue in the 2024 campaign – where Biden’s likely opponent, Donald Trump, is facing criminal charges for his handling of classified material, even though Hur made clear how different the two cases were.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/joe-biden-house-ukraine/index.html,"Washington CNN — President Joe Biden on Friday criticized the House for taking a two-week break amid a heated push for additional funding for Ukraine in its war against Russia. After addressing reports of Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny’s death on Friday, Biden was asked by reporters whether there was any way to get additional ammunition to Ukraine without the passage of a supplemental funding bill by Congress. “No, but it’s about time they step up, don’t you think?” the president said. “Instead of going on a two-week vacation.” Biden raised his voice: “Two weeks, they’re walking away. Two weeks. What are they thinking? My God, this is bizarre, and it’s just reinforcing all of the concern and almost – I won’t say panic – but real concern about the United States being a reliable ally. This is outrageous.” The push comes at a crucial time for Ukraine. American officials previously warned that US aid to the war-torn country ran out last year, and the US provides more funding than any other country to Ukraine. The Senate passed a bipartisan $95 billion bill that provided the Ukraine funding, along with support for Taiwan and Israel, but House Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled he won’t bring the bill to the House floor. The House is on recess until the end of this month. Responding to Nalvany’s reported death, Johnson said that while “Congress debates the best path forward to support Ukraine, the United States, and our partners, must be using every means available to cut off Putin’s ability to fund his unprovoked war in Ukraine and aggression against the Baltic states.” Johnson and other House Republicans had demanded that any additional funding to Ukraine be tied to significant immigration-related funding and policy changes. Democrats made some concessions for the Senate bill, but prospects of a funding bill passing the House were torpedoed after former President Donald Trump pushed Republicans to oppose it. And the prospects of additional funding after the election remains in question if Trump, the GOP frontrunner who recently signaled indifference to Russia invading a NATO ally, wins in the fall. A small group of bipartisan House members have unveiled their own plan to send more money to Ukraine in an effort to put pressure on Johnson to act. But, it’s unclear whether that could get enough support in the chamber. Biden said on Friday that “failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten.” “Now, as I said before, and I mean this in a literal sense, history is watching. History is watching the House of Representatives,” the president said. Asked whether Navalny’s reported death would burgeon support for additional funding from members of Congress, Biden said “I hope to God it helps.” This story has been updated with additional reporting."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/allison-greenfield-engoron-judge/index.html,"CNN — The law clerk Donald Trump accused of “co-judging” his civil fraud trial is running for her own seat in Manhattan civil court in the upcoming November elections. Allison Greenfield was a frequent point of contention for Trump’s legal team – even costing Trump thousands in fines for violating a gag order barring him from talking about her. Trump’s lawyers complained about her presence on the bench seated next to the judge, accusing her of ‘co-judging’ as she often passed notes to Judge Arthur Engoron and whispered in his ear before he ruled. Engoron imposed a gag order in the first week of trial after Trump published negative social media posts about Greenfield accusing her of bias and made an unfounded claim about a relationship with a top senator. The judge later expanded the gag order to cover the attorneys and fined Trump twice for violating the order after continued public criticisms of Greenfield. Trump’s legal team made several unsuccessful bids to appeal the gag order, arguing that Trump’s lawyers should be able to make a record of what they say was bias against the former president. During the trial, Engoron fiercely defended his law clerk of five years during the 11-week trial, pounding his fist on the bench as he reprimanded Trump’s lawyers and at one point suggested their complaints were misogynistic. Trump attorney Alina Habba pushed back on that notion, telling Engoron she was equally offended by Greenfield’s attitude toward Trump’s defense team and “eye rolls and constant whispering.” Greenfield could soon have a bench of her own as she’s currently running unopposed, according to a source familiar with the matter. She’s running for a countywide civil court position that is a lower-level judgeship than that of her boss, who had to win another election to make the rise from county judge to the state supreme court. The Democratic candidate has received several endorsements from partisan groups in recent weeks including the Manhattan Democratic Party. The Manhattan Democratic Party’s Civil Court Independent Judicial Screening Panel named her as one of the “most highly qualified” candidates earlier this month."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/trump-january-6-civil-lawsuits/index.html,"CNN — Civil lawsuits seeking to hold Donald Trump accountable for the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack can move forward after the former president declined to ask the Supreme Court to decide whether he is shielded by presidential immunity. A federal appeals court in December cleared the way for three lawsuits brought against Trump by Democratic lawmakers and US Capitol Police officers to proceed, unanimously holding that not everything a president does or says while in office is protected from liability. Trump faced a Thursday deadline to seek the Supreme Court’s review of that decision, but his legal team declined to turn to the high court. The decision means the lawsuits will move to a fact-finding phase at the trial-level federal court in Washington, DC. Trump can continue to claim presidential immunity before that court, but it will be up to the judge overseeing the case to determine whether the conduct at issue was done in Trump’s official capacity as president or as a candidate and therefore not shielded by presidential immunity. The case could still eventually come before the Supreme Court. The decision to not turn to the justices is a departure from how Trump’s team has been handling stinging lower-court rulings as he barrels toward the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. On Monday, the former president asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block a unanimous decision issued last week by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals that rejected his claim that he’s immune from criminal election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. And last week, the justices heard oral arguments in a dispute over whether Trump should be disqualified from the ballot for his conduct on January 6, with a majority of them appearing ready to back the former president in the case. In the civil immunity matter, the plaintiffs in the three underlying lawsuits have all seized on Trump’s speech on January 6, alleging that his words led to the subsequent attack on the Capitol. The lawmakers claimed in a pair of lawsuits that they were threatened by Trump and others as part of a conspiracy to stop the congressional session that would certify the 2020 presidential election. They argue Trump should bear responsibility for directing the assaults. The police officers said in their suit that they were hit by chemical sprays and objects attendees threw at them because Trump inspired the crowd. Lower courts sided with the plaintiffs as Trump sought to have the cases dismissed based on his claims of presidential immunity. A federal judge in DC ruled in 2022 that Trump’s statements to his supporters before the riot “is the essence of civil conspiracy” because Trump spoke about himself and rallygoers working “towards a common goal” of fighting and walking down Pennsylvania Avenue. The DC Circuit later upheld that ruling , saying in December that the president “does not spend every minute of every day exercising official responsibilities.” “And when he acts outside the functions of his office, he does not continue to enjoy immunity. … When he acts in an unofficial, private capacity, he is subject to civil suits like any private citizen,” the court said in the unanimous ruling authored by Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan. The Supreme Court is still considering whether to step into Trump’s federal criminal case related to January 6. In his emergency request earlier this week, the former president asked the high court to pause the DC Circuit’s ruling so he can appeal it to the justices and, potentially, a panel consisting of all the judges on the appeals court. In the DC Circuit’s ruling last week, the judges left no question that Trump can be prosecuted by Smith, writing: “For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant.” “But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution,” the judges said. For now, Trump’s trial on federal charges that he worked to undermine the results of the 2020 election remains paused as the high court considers what to do with his emergency request.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/navalny-death-biden-trump-divide/index.html,"CNN — The announcement of Alexey Navalny’s death on Friday thrust fresh urgency into the roiling debate in Washington over how forcefully to counter Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, a question of wide-ranging consequence on which President Joe Biden and his likely opponent Donald Trump have adopted diametrically opposed positions. The disparity in how the two men reacted to the news underscored the divide. “Make no mistake: Putin is responsible for Navalny’s death. Putin is responsible. What has happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin’s brutality. Nobody should be fooled,” Biden said from the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Friday, forcefully pinning blame on “Putin and his thugs.” Trump, meanwhile, said nothing directly about the Russian opposition leader in a post that his campaign said was his official response to Navalny’s death. Instead, he spent the morning posting more than 20 times on Truth Social about his criminal cases, his election poll numbers, immigrants in the US, his GOP presidential rival Nikki Haley, the Teamsters labor union and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ testimony in Georgia. For Democrats and a minority of Republicans who are proponents of a muscular American presence in Europe within the NATO defense alliance, Navalny’s death served as yet another grim reminder of Putin’s brutality and the necessity of a US-led effort to isolate Moscow. But for skeptics in the Trump camp, it was far from clear whether even the death in a notoriously brutal prison camp of Putin’s leading critic would alter a hardening view that Russia’s aggression no longer requires robust western reprisals, and that the nearly 80-year-old US-led security architecture in Europe is outdated. The stakes could hardly be higher, and Biden warned forcefully from the White House that “history is watching” the debate unfold. “The failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten,” Biden said Friday. “It’s going to go down in the pages of history. It really is. It’s consequential. And the clock is ticking.” The decision US politicians make in the coming weeks and months on whether to continue sending assistance to Ukraine could dramatically alter the battlefield realties there and send a global signal of American willingness not only to push back on Russia but to involve itself abroad at all. Other top Biden administration officials wasted little time pinning blame on Navalny’s death directly on Putin, even as the Kremlin said it was working to determine the cause. “Whatever story they tell, let us be clear Russia is responsible and we’ll have more to say on this later,” Vice President Kamala Harris said at the start of an address at the Munich Security Conference, where American support for Ukraine and to its NATO commitments has been a central and pressing topic of conversation. A few moments earlier, Secretary of State Antony Blinken linked Navalny’s death directly to Russia’s president. “His death in a Russian prison and the fixation and fear of one man only underscores the weakness and rot at the heart of the system that Putin has built,” the US top diplomat said at the start of a meeting with Indian officials on the sidelines of the Munich gathering. Lingering just underneath those pronouncements was the reality that in the United States, the long-held consensus on the value of alliances and systems to guard against Russian aggression is fraying. Asked whether Navalny’s death might spur Congress to act in providing more Ukraine aid, Biden was hopeful. “I hope to God it helps,” he said. Trump has shattered orthodox thinking Trump, who seems to be reveling in undermining what had been a bipartisan consensus in American foreign policy for more than 70 years, has said he would encourage Russia to attack NATO allies who “didn’t pay” — a remark that sent shockwaves through the defense alliance , which had already been bracing for his potential return to office in 2025, but was hardly surprising to his followers. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and fellow Republicans have refused to consider a spending package that includes around $60 billion in new funding for Ukraine, despite administration warnings that Ukrainian troops are running out of ammunition and failing to support Kyiv would amount to a victory for Putin. Even so, Johnson said in a statement Friday that Putin “is likely directly responsible” for Navalny’s death. And Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host with a major conservative following, returned from an interview with Putin last week (which even Putin complained was too soft) proclaiming how much nicer and cleaner Moscow was than any American city. Trump has reportedly mused about selecting Carlson as a running mate. A select number of Republicans have sought to guard against the growing strain of isolationism within their party. On Friday, Trump’s sole remaining competitor for the Republican presidential nomination, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, assailed her opponent for saying he would encourage Russia to invade other nations. “Think about what that says, that Trump’s siding with a thug who kills his political opponents. By the way, he killed another one this morning,” Haley said on a South Carolina radio show. “He’s siding with Putin, who continues to try and destroy America at every turn.” For Biden and his top officials, the assault on international norms and institutions has generated both fury and concern. Biden was aghast at Trump’s remark when he learned about it last weekend and condemned it as “dumb” and “un-American” in a speech from the White House on Tuesday. A campaign issue On Friday, the Biden campaign unveiled a new digital ad blasting Trump’s comment. “Every president since Truman has been a rock-solid supporter of NATO - except for Donald Trump,” a narrator says as images of Trump with Putin flashes across the screen. “Trump wants to walk away from NATO. He’s even given Putin and Russia the greenlight to attack America’s allies.” Part of a three-week, six-figure digital ad campaign, the spot is set to run through Super Tuesday targeting voters in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The campaign said it was looking to reach more than 2.5 million Americans who identify as Estonian, Finnish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian and Polish — all NATO countries bordering Russia. In 2021, Biden emerged from his first (and, so far, only) face-to-face meeting with Putin to say he had warned his counterpart that he’d be punished if Navalny were to die in prison. “I made it clear to him that I believe the consequences of that would be devastating for Russia,” Biden said in Geneva, where the summit was held. Since then, the United States and its partners in Europe and Asia have piled sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, seeking to isolate the country from the global financial system and ratchet up costs on the perpetrators of the war. But it’s those same sanctions that have caused energy prices to rise in Europe and taken a toll on the global economy, lending grist to some Republican efforts to halt foreign funding for Ukraine’s military and urge an immediate end to the conflict. As American assistance for Ukraine wavers, defense officials have warned of the consequences on the battlefield. On Friday, an official told reporters the US is “sixteenth in the world” among the countries providing security assistance to Ukraine when considering the percentage of GDP. “At this point, the United States is — we’re not the top donor to Ukraine when it comes to security assistance, or economic assistance for that matter,” the official told reporters. “When you look at security assistance, we’re actually the sixteenth in the world when it comes to percentage of GDP. So we have a lot to appreciate from our allies and partners.” Harris, who was already preparing to provide reassurances to rattled allies during her visit to the Munich conference this week, sought to underscore American commitment to protecting democracy and freedom around the world, and took veiled aim at Trump for suggesting otherwise. “They suggest it’s in the best interest of the American people to isolate ourselves from the world, to flout common understandings among nations, to embrace dictators, and adopt the repressive tactics and abandon commitments to our allies in favor of unilateral action,” Harris said in her remarks at the yearly gathering of US and European leaders, which has traditionally acted as a citadel of transatlanticism. “Let me be clear—that worldview is dangerous, destabilizing and indeed shortsighted,” she said. Shortly after Harris left the stage, Navalny’s wife made a surprise appearance in Munich to urge the international community to fight against Putin’s “horrific” regime. “They will be brought to justice, and this day will come soon,” she said.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/alejandro-mayorkas-cnntv/index.html,"CNN — Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Friday defended his record on the border, saying his impeachment by House Republicans has no basis in fact or law and he has no plans to slow down his work. In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour at the Munich Security Conference, his first since Tuesday’s impeachment vote, Mayorkas downplayed the vote’s effects on his day-to-day job, despite becoming the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in 150 years. “I don’t let it distract me from the work – would I have preferred that correctness had prevailed? Of course,” Mayorkas told Amanpour. “So, the fact that it did not, does not, slow me down in doing the work that I’m tasked to do by the president of the United States.” The embattled homeland security secretary spoke to CNN on the sidelines of the annual security conference. In a wide-ranging interview, he also commented on the reported death of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny and defended President Joe Biden’s mental acuity in the wake of special counsel Robert Hur’s report. As a member of the administration’s delegation to the conference, Mayorkas rebuffed the idea that Tuesday’s impeachment had compromised his standing with world leaders. “They very, very well understand the politics of the moment – not only in the United States, but in their respective countries as well,” he said. “And the leaders with whom I am meeting, the great majority of which I have met before – they know me. They know me, they know the seriousness of my purpose, and the fact that I am focused on mission. The politics are an aside.” Mayorkas left the door open to defending himself during impeachment proceedings in the Senate but declined to weigh in definitively either way, telling Amanpour, “We’ll see what the process brings.” CNN reported earlier this week that the Senate is unlikely to spend much time on the impeachment trial, with sources saying that Democrats could dismiss charges on a simple majority vote before each side argues its case. Mayorkas was impeached by House Republicans over their claims that he had committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar. Tuesday’s vote was 214 to 213. Three Republicans – Ken Buck of Colorado, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Tom McClintock of California – voted with Democrats against the measure. Republicans have been investigating Mayorkas’ handling of the border since they reclaimed the House majority, but momentum to plot a swift impeachment of the secretary picked up steam last month as key swing-district Republicans expressed fresh openness to the idea amid a recent surge of migrant crossings at the southern border . In the interview Friday, Mayorkas acknowledged “unanimity” across the political spectrum “that our system in the United States – our immigration system – is broken.” But he called on Republicans in Congress to back bipartisan immigration reform. “I was very privileged and honored to sit with a bipartisan group of senators to fashion legislative fixes that are overdue now for decades,” he said. “It is in fact what the Republicans insisted upon – the bipartisan group of senators delivered, the question that everyone is asking is, was a solution actually desired, or do people want the problem as a tool for politics?” On Navalny’s reported death, Mayorkas told Amanpour in an interview on Friday that, if confirmed, it would mark “tragic news for the world.” “We are, of course, still confirming it, but it speaks to the depravity of Vladimir Putin and our need, as a world, to have resolve against authoritarianism and the invasion of another country that is just yearning for its sovereignty,” Mayorkas told Amanpour. The homeland security secretary criticized House Republicans for blocking additional aid to Ukraine, citing the administration’s efforts to present “a united front against Vladimir Putin.” “The inability to continue with emphasis that leadership on the part of the United States – the uncertainty that we are bringing – only can empower Vladimir Putin, and we have to continue our leadership,” he said. The homeland security secretary also took the opportunity to push back against last week’s special counsel report from Hur, taking issue with Hur’s characterization of Biden as an aging president beset by memory issues. “I’ve interacted with the president countless times,” Mayorkas told Amanpour. “I’ve said publicly the most difficult part about a meeting with President Biden is preparing for it, because he is probing, exacting, and quite detail-oriented and focused.” And he called Hur’s comments on Biden’s ability to recall key events “inappropriate, and a deviation from Department of Justice norms.” “The responsibility of a prosecutor, including a special counsel, is to learn the facts, determine the facts, and apply the law to those facts – that was done, and the conclusion is that no case was there, and therefore the case is closed,” Mayorkas said. “To add the fact that those gratuitous personal remarks were terribly inaccurate only makes it even more inappropriate.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/house-foreign-aid-border-bill/index.html,"CNN — A small group of bipartisan House lawmakers has unveiled their own plan to send aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and crack down on illegal crossings at the southern border, an effort to put additional pressure on Speaker Mike Johnson to act on Ukraine aid even as House lawmakers recess until the end of the month. Despite the Senate passing a bipartisan bill that provided $95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan earlier this week, Johnson has signaled he won’t bring that bill to the floor in the House as he faces pressure from his right flank not to act on Ukraine aid. It’s not clear that the new bill will break through in a chamber where there has been growing conservative resistance to voting on more aid to Ukraine and likely liberal opposition to some of the immigration provisions included in the bill. The plan, which was authored by 10 members including Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and Maine Democrat Rep. Jared Golden, would provide more than $66 billion in military assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, but would not provide the same humanitarian aid included in the Senate bill. The legislation would also restore the so-called “Remain in Mexico” policy, which requires individuals seeking asylum to return to Mexico until their case is ready for court in the US. “Securing one’s borders is necessary to preserve one’s democracy and therefore necessary to maintaining world order and world peace,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement. “But we also have an obligation to assist our allies in securing their borders, especially when they come under assault by dictators, terrorists and totalitarians.” Fitzpatrick told CNN that Republicans who authored the bill plan will discuss their legislation with Johnson in the days ahead. But defense hawks in the House and many members running in swing districts in November have warned that they don’t want House Republicans to be the reason Ukraine aid fails. “In the end, I don’t want it to be Republicans’ legacy that Ukraine fell. Period,” Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska, told CNN last week. “We’ve been playing nice talking about the border and trying to link this, but that didn’t work. Now, we are going to be more forceful and forthright that Ukraine is in our national security interest.” There are few options remaining to get Ukraine aid on the floor, something that the White House has said for months is essential to ensuring that the country doesn’t lose its battle against Russia in the months ahead. If Johnson won’t put the legislation on the floor, Democrats could try to convince a handful of Republicans to sign what is known as a discharge petition, an arcane and seldomly used device that would force a vote on Ukraine aid if a majority of the House signs on. It’s not clear that Republicans – even a handful – would be willing to buck their leadership and force that vote. The odds of getting Ukraine aid out of the House has been made even more difficult by the fact that the front-runner to win the GOP nomination for president, Donald Trump, has made clear he’s opposed to the Senate-passed bill. “WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE MONEY ANYMORE WITHOUT THE HOPE OF A PAYBACK, OR WITHOUT ‘STRINGS’ ATTACHED. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE ‘STUPID’ NO LONGER!” Trump posted Saturday on Truth Social."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/coast-guard-sexual-assault-senate-records-invs/index.html,"CNN — Records turned over to Congress this month reveal how top officials at the US Coast Guard engaged in a calculated plan to conceal the damning findings of an investigation into decades of sexual assault cases at the agency’s academy, going so far as to create a list of the pros and cons of being transparent. Coast Guard officials only told Congress about the explosive probe last year after CNN started making inquiries. Dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, the multi-year internal investigation found that rapes and other sexual abuse at the prestigious Coast Guard Academy had been ignored and often covered up by high-ranking officials. But telling Congress and the public about this scandal, leaders worried, could “risk the initiation of comprehensive Congressional investigations, hearings, and media interest,” according to 2018 internal records supplied to the Senate Homeland Security Committee’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in February. New London, Conn.(Apr. 10)--Sign on wall U.S. Coast Guard Academy facing Route 1 (Mohegan Ave.)  USCG photo by SANTOS, DAVID M. PA1 David M. Santos/U.S. Coast Guard/FILE Related article Four women to testify at Senate hearing about sexual harassment and assault at Coast Guard Academy The records, which do not carry the letterhead or signature of any identifiable author, carefully laid out multiple possible courses of action, and the option to proactively brief Congress was “NOT RECOMMENDED.” Among the concerns listed were “intense scrutiny of all past to present CGA leadership,” a potential demand for all sexual assault cases to be reviewed and “extensive media coverage and investigative journalism…and suggested malfeasance.” Public scrutiny could raise questions about why actions taken over the past decade to change the academy’s culture had not improved sexual assault reporting rates, the records stated. And in a handwritten list of pros and cons, which the Coast Guard confirmed to CNN was written by then-Vice Commandant Admiral Charles Ray, the “cons” of disclosing the investigation included “re-victimizing” and “investigations w/o end.” The “pros” were “rip bandaid off,” “proactive vs reactive” and “cultural guilt purged.” “If things are bad, they get worse with non-disclo[sure],” Ray wrote in a separate note, which appeared to list viewpoints of different Coast Guard officials. Ultimately, officials recommended in the records that information be provided to Congress or other parties only if asked. The Coast Guard did not tell CNN who authored the recommendations and noted that they were made before the investigation was officially closed. The agency emphasized that current Commandant Admiral Linda Fagan has acknowledged it was a mistake not to disclose the investigation to Congress and said it is fully cooperating with the Senate investigation – sifting through more than a million pages of documents and only making legally necessary redactions. Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan L. Noel/US Coast Guard Related article US Coast Guard leaders long concealed a critical report about racism, hazing and sexual misconduct CNN previously reported that the investigation’s concealing had gone to the top of the agency. The Commandant at the time, Admiral Karl Schultz, along with his second in command, Ray, had made the decision to keep Fouled Anchor secret after taking the helm in 2018. Ray resigned from a Coast Guard Academy leadership institute following CNN’s report on his role in withholding the information. Ray and Schultz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since the scandal came to light in June, Fagan has issued a series of unprecedented apologies to members of Congress, current and former academy cadets, and the entire Coast Guard workforce and has directed a host of reforms to how sexual assault cases are handled across the agency. “These documents are troubling and raise new questions,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, where the academy is based, and Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, wrote in a letter to Fagan on Wednesday about the new records they received. The senators are spearheading an investigation into the Coast Guard, which was launched in September in reaction to CNN’s reporting. Both senators have lambasted the Coast Guard for its lack of transparency and cooperation with the investigation, saying at a December hearing that subpoenas would be issued if necessary and that current leaders of both the academy and the agency may be called to answer for the decisions they have made. The Coast Guard said earlier this month in a news bulletin that it has already provided more than 36,000 pages of material in response to various ongoing investigations, including multiple congressional inquiries and a probe launched by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General. A House Oversight inquiry is looking beyond sexual assault, examining the Coast Guard’s handling of a variety of misconduct after CNN reported that agency leaders also suppressed a “Culture of Respect” review from April 2015 that documented racial and gender discrimination, hazing and assault across the service. So far, records provided to Congressional investigators have been missing attachments and have included redactions that prevent the subcommittee from “understanding the full scope of the Coast Guard’s decisions,” the senators wrote in Wednesday’s letter. They also requested that officials provide a list of names of anyone involved with the recently released records about the decision not to brief Congress. Blumenthal and Johnson, along with several other senators, proposed new bipartisan legislation this week that would make it safe for Coast Guard Academy cadets to report sexual assault and harassment without getting in trouble for minor infractions such as drinking or violating curfew. The Coast Guard announced a similar “safe to report” policy earlier this month, as part of yet another round of reforms enacted in the wake of CNN’s reporting. Other changes included increasing the legal experience required to become a Special Victims’ Counsel and decreasing the barriers to accessing benefits for victims of sexual assault."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/navy-federal-congressional-black-caucus/index.html,"CNN — Members of Congress pressed the CEO of the nation’s largest credit union for answers about racial disparities in its mortgage lending during a Capitol Hill meeting Thursday but said they left unsatisfied with her responses. Mary McDuffie, the CEO of Navy Federal Credit Union, met with three members of the Congressional Black Caucus who have demanded answers in the wake of CNN’s reporting on racial disparities in the lender’s mortgage approvals. She told them that an external review the credit union commissioned had preliminarily found that the disparities were mostly explained by other factors, a spokesperson said. But members of Congress said they still had concerns about the mortgage practices of Navy Federal, which has more than 13 million members and lends to military servicemembers, defense personnel, veterans and their families. “We’re trying to achieve the goal of closing the racial wealth gap in America,” said Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, after meeting with McDuffie. “You cannot do that with practices like this that deny equal opportunity to homeownership.” A CNN investigation published in December found that Navy Federal approved more than 75% of the White borrowers who applied for a new conventional home purchase mortgage in 2022 while approving less than 50% of Black borrowers who applied for the same type of loan, according to the most recent federal data available. Photo illustration. Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/Shutterstock Related article The nation’s largest credit union rejected more than half its Black conventional mortgage applicants The nearly 29-percentage-point gap in Navy Federal’s approval rates was the widest of any of the 50 lenders that originated the most mortgage loans in 2022. The disparity remained even after accounting for variables available in public mortgage data such as applicants’ income, debt-to-income ratio and property value, CNN’s review found. McDuffie met for about an hour Thursday with Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus; Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance; and Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California. McDuffie declined to answer CNN’s questions as she entered and exited the closed-door meeting. A Navy Federal spokesperson said in a statement that McDuffie shared with the House members the results of a “preliminary analysis” from an external review the credit union initiated showing that the racial disparity in approval rates “drops to around 1% when all other factors that we consider when approving home loans are incorporated, including credit score, verified income, and property information.” The spokesperson did not provide additional details or data supporting the analysis. Navy Federal has previously argued that CNN’s analysis is incomplete because it did not include applicants’ credit scores or information about their available cash deposits or relationship history with the lender – none of which is publicly available in the public federal data. The credit union has declined to provide CNN any data that would make it possible to analyze those factors. The credit union is “committed to engaging with policymakers on this important issue” and “we continue to work daily to help expand economic opportunity and access to credit for our diverse community of members,” the spokesperson said. But Cleaver told CNN after the meeting that McDuffie and other Navy Federal representatives “could not provide an answer” explaining the racial disparities in mortgage approvals, and that he hoped to hear more from them in the future. “We’re expecting to have another meeting with them, we’re expecting to get facts this time,” he said. Reps. Steven Horsford and Emanuel Cleaver speak to reporters after meeting with Navy Federal Credit Union CEO Mary McDuffie on Capitol Hill. CNN Horsford said that the members “asked very specific questions about the timeline” of Navy Federal’s external review, and found the responses from Navy Federal “inadequate.” “Time is of the essence, because every single day that they don’t change or update their protocols is a servicemember, and particularly a Black or Latino servicemember, who is facing denials,” he said. Navy Federal has also noted that a higher percentage of its mortgage loans go to Black borrowers than most other large lenders. But Horsford said Thursday that that excuse didn’t address “the issue of denials.” “More than 40% of our servicemembers, active duty, are people of color,” he said. “So yeah, they are one of the leading lenders and mortgage lenders for Black home loans – because they have a higher percentage of servicemembers who are their membership. It should be higher.” Several Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee, including Cleaver and ranking member Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, wrote a letter last week asking the committee’s Republican chair to hold a hearing on the racial disparities in Navy Federal’s mortgage lending. And ten Democratic senators have separately asked federal regulators to examine Navy Federal’s mortgage practices, citing both CNN and a separate analysis of public mortgage data by Senate banking committee staff that also found racial disparities in its lending. Navy Federal is also facing a federal class-action lawsuit from mortgage applicants who cite CNN’s reporting and allege that the credit union discriminated against them. A judge approved a motion to consolidate three separate lawsuits against the credit union into a single case last month.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/politics/kamala-harris-trump-nato/index.html,"Washington CNN — US Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday called reports Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has died in a Russian prison “terrible news,” and that “Russia is responsible.” “We’ve all just received reports that Alexey Navalny has died in Russia. This is, of course, terrible news, which we are working to confirm,” Harris said as she began her remarks. She added, “If confirmed this, would be a further sign of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s brutality. Whatever story they tell, let us be clear: Russia is responsible.” The Russian prison service said Friday morning that Navalny died. He had been serving multiple lengthy prison sentences for crimes that he had denied. He faced those charges after returning to Russia following treatment in Germany after being poisoned in August 2020. Navalny returned to Russia after that treatment concluded in 2021, and he was quickly arrested. Navalny had long been a point of contention between the US and Russia. President Joe Biden previously told reporters in 2021 that he warned Putin that the consequences would be “ devastating for Russia ,” if Navalny died in prison. Harris had been facing the fraught task of reassuring US allies on the world stage, as lawmakers struggle to pass aid for Ukraine and Israel and former President Donald Trump threatens to abandon NATO allies. It was another high-profile moment for Harris to address the Munich Security Conference Friday amid a consequential moment in US foreign policy, as ongoing conflicts overseas have roiled domestic politics. It came at a delicate time for the White House, which continues to grapple with the fallout of the special counsel report that called into question President Joe Biden’s mental acuity and has placed renewed focus on the vice president. But it suddenly became an opportunity for Harris to be the most prominent American voice to offer a reaction to the reports of Navalny’s death. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on NPR earlier Friday that the US was working to confirm Navalny’s death. “If it’s confirmed, it is a terrible tragedy, and given the Russian government’s long and sordid history of doing harm to its opponents, it raises real and obvious questions about what happened here,” Sullivan said. The administration had repeatedly called for Navalny’s immediate release, and CNN has reported Biden called for Navalny’s release in his first phone call with Putin after taking office in 2021. After her opening comment on Navalny, Harris transitioned into her prepared remarks that were meant to reassure American allies over the future of US foreign policy. Chief among the worries from the US’ top allies is Trump’s statement last weekend that he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense. After the Biden administration helped strengthen the bonds of the NATO alliance following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Trump’s statement is sparking real concern that he would not abide by the collective-defense clause at the heart of the alliance if reelected. During her speech, Harris launched a veiled attack against Trump, describing his foreign policy approach as “dangerous” and issuing a stark warning if the US cedes ground to Russia. “They suggest it’s in the best interest of the American people to isolate ourselves from the world, to flout common understandings among nations, to embrace dictators, and adopt the repressive tactics and abandon commitments to our allies in favor of unilateral action,” Harris said. “Let me be clear – that worldview is dangerous, destabilizing and indeed shortsighted,” she said. Trump had drawn immediate consternation last weekend for saying he would encourage Russia to invade countries who don’t meet their NATO obligations. The comment concerned not only the American foreign policy establishment but from American NATO allies, who have watched warily as Russia proceeds with its invasion of Ukraine . The former president on Wednesday said he wouldn’t defend NATO nations who don’t spend enough on defense but did not repeat his comment about encouraging Russia to do whatever they wante “I’ve been saying look, if they’re not going to pay, we’re not going to protect, OK. And Biden said, ‘Oh this is so bad, this is so terrible that he would say that.’ No, if they’re not paying their bills, and most of them weren’t when I got there,” Trump said at a campaign event in North Charleston, South Carolina. Harris maintained Friday that US commitment to NATO remains “ironclad” in the wake of Trump’s comments. It’s a similar message to the one that has been promoted by her boss this week. Biden took direct aim at his predecessor on Tuesday, pointedly accusing Trump of “bowing down” to Putin in some of his harshest criticism of his likely rival on foreign policy to date. Trump, Biden claimed, sent a “dangerous and shocking” signal with his comments, delivered during a weekend campaign rally. Concern is also rising over the ability of Washington to send more aid to Ukraine. For months, the White House’s national security supplemental request that includes billions in funding for Ukraine and Israel, among other priorities, has remained stalled in Congress over GOP infighting. The White House has repeatedly stressed the need to deliver additional funds to Ukraine, framing it as a matter of national security. Harris will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday. Harris called Putin’s war in Ukraine an “utter failure” and stressed the consequences of ceding any ground to Russia, reaffirming US support for Ukraine. “Imagine if America turned our back on Ukraine and abandoned our NATO allies and abandoned our treaty commitments. Imagine if we went easy on Putin. Let alone encouraged him,” Harris said. “History offers a clue. If we stand by while an aggressor invades its neighbor with impunity, they will keep going. In the case of Putin, that means all of Europe would be threatened. If we fail to impose severe consequences on Russia, other authoritarians across the globe would be emboldened,” Harris said. This story has been updated with additional developments on Friday."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/30/politics/trump-fraud-trial-verdict-what-to-watch-for/index.html,"CNN — New York state Judge Arthur Engoron has the future of Donald Trump’s business empire in his hands – and we may learn that fate Friday. After a contentious 11-week trial, Engoron is poised to rule how much money Trump and his co-defendants owe for fraud as well as whether the former president can still do business in the state . He has already ruled that Trump engaged in fraud. The civil lawsuit from New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, is seeking $370 million from Trump and the other defendants (the figure was originally $250 million). She alleges that Trump filed fraudulent financial statements that allowed him to obtain loans and insurance at more favorable rates. The trial goes to the heart of Trump’s image as a successful billionaire and includes accusations of fraud regarding his Trump Tower apartment, Mar-a-Lago estate and several golf courses, among other assets. Here’s what to know ahead of Friday’s expected verdict: What’s at stake James is asking for $370 million from Trump and the co-defendants in disgorgement – or ill-gotten gains. Engoron has already ruled that Trump has engaged in fraud and ordered the dissolution of his business empire, an action that is on hold pending Trump’s appeal. Engoron canceled business certificates for many of Trump’s entities in New York, including the Trump Organization (a sprawling entity comprised of 500 limited liability companies). Engoron also called for a receiver to oversee the dissolution of the entities, which include buildings such as Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street and the Seven Springs family compound in Westchester County, New York. His upcoming ruling will address six additional claims including conspiracy, issuing false financial statements, falsifying business records and insurance fraud. The attorney general’s office argued in its closing presentation that Trump “acted with intent” to fraudulently inflate the value of his assets in his financial statements. “The buck stopped with him,” said Andrew Amer, a lawyer for the attorney general’s office, saying that Trump was responsible for the conduct Trump Org. executives Allen Weisselberg and Jeff McConney participated in to inflate his assets. “Mr. Trump was certainly in the loop to review and approve the statements,” Amer said. “The court should infer that he acted with intent to defraud based on his extensive knowledge about these assets. How harsh will Engoron be? The back and forth between the judge, Trump and the former president’s lawyers during the trial was repeatedly heated. Trump’s social media messages and comments outside the court even led to a partial gag order and fines. Engoron was quotable during the trial and in two written rulings against Trump and has not held back in criticizing the former president. “In defendants’ world: rent-regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party’s lies,” Engoron wrote in the summary judgment ruling against Trump . “That is a fantasy world, not the real world,” the judge added. And in December, the judge wrote a scathing denial of the former president’s attempt to toss the case. In the three-page opinion rejection the motion for a directed verdict to dismiss the case, Engoron said that experts called at trial by Trump’s attorneys were not credible and that the defense’s key arguments were unconvincing. A valuation can be based on different criteria and analyzed different ways, the judge wrote, “But a lie is still a lie.” What about the kids? In addition to banning Trump from doing business in New York for life, the attorney general is asking for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, the co-CEOs of the Trump Org., to be banned from doing business in New York for five years. But during the closing presentations earlier this month, Engoron asked pointed questions to the attorney general’s office about whether Trump’s adult sons were liable for an intent to defraud and conspiracy. (He already found them guilty of fraud.) “What evidence do you have – I just haven’t seen it – that they knew that there was fraud?” Engoron asked. Ivanka Trump was originally named as a defendant, but claims against her were dismissed last year by an appeals court over the statute of limitations. Trump’s arguments Trump turned the civil trial into a series of campaign appearances, speaking to TV cameras several times each day outside of the courtroom when he was there. He has consistently framed the entire affair as a political prosecution, sought to belittle James, fought with the judge and his clerk, and accused , without proof, the attorney general and White House of colluding to keep him out of office. “This was a political witch hunt,” Trump said in a dramatic moment in court earlier this month while speaking to Engoron. “What’s happened here, sir, is a fraud on me.” Legally, Trump and his team argue that there’s no proof of an intent to defraud and that lenders were obligated to conduct their own due diligence, regardless of the valuations at the Trump Org. supplied. Furthermore, Trump says, companies like Deutsche Bank wanted to do business with Trump Org. and went into the deals with open eyes. Trump has already appealed the earlier Engoron ruling and has pledged to appeal whatever he rules here. It’s unclear how quickly any decision would be put in force as well. Gag order Trump’s demeanor in and out of the courtroom led to a remarkable gag order and fines issued by Engoron against the former president. Engoron and one of his clerks became the subject of “serious and credible” death threats – the judge was even “swatted” on the day of closing arguments this month. In early October, Trump posted on social media a baseless allegation about Engoron’s law clerk, leading to the gag order. The judge later extended the order to include Trump’s attorneys from commenting on the judge’s private communications with his law clerk. The order does not limit public criticism of Engoron, the district attorney or other parts of the case. As the trial neared an end in December, Engoron reminisced. “In a strange way, I’m gonna miss this trial,” the judge said. “It’s been an experience.” This story has been updated with the anticipated verdict timing."

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/former-fbi-informant-charged-biden-burisma/index.html,"CNN — Special counsel David Weiss charged a former FBI informant with lying about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s involvement in business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, undercutting a major aspect of Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into the president. Alexander Smirnov, 43, is facing charges in connection with lying to the FBI and creating false records. He was arrested Thursday at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, after his arrival in the US from overseas, and will make his initial appearance in federal court Thursday afternoon. CNN is working to determine whether Smirnov has an attorney. The indictment alleges that Smirnov’s story to the FBI “was a fabrication, an amalgam of otherwise unremarkable business meetings and contacts that had actually occurred but at a later date than he claimed and for the purpose of pitching Burisma on the Defendant’s services and products, not for discussing bribes to [Joe Biden] when he was in office.” Congressional Republicans have championed Smirnov’s now-discredited allegations for roughly a year, though not by name. They fought with the FBI to obtain memos about what Smirnov told investigators and publicly released the materials over the FBI’s objections. The congressional Republicans repeatedly praised Smirnov as “credible” and put his uncorroborated claims front-and-center in their impeachment inquiry into the president. While announcing the impeachment inquiry, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said “a trusted FBI informant has alleged a bribe to the Biden family.” The FBI is now using some of the same memos that congressional Republicans released as part of their indictment against Smirnov. “For months we have warned that Republicans have built their conspiracies about Hunter and his family on lies told by people with political agendas, not facts,” said Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden’s lawyer, in a statement to CNN. “We were right and the air is out of their balloon. This is just another instance of Chairmen Comer and Jordan peddling falsehoods based on dishonest, uncredible allegations and witnesses,” he added. House Oversight Chair James Comer said in a Thursday statement to CNN that his investigation into the president does not revolve around Smirnov or his claims made in the FD-1023 – a form the FBI uses to memorialize information gathered from confidential sources – that Republican legislators have cited. “To be clear, the impeachment inquiry is not reliant on the FBI’s FD-1023. It is based on a large record of evidence, including bank records and witness testimony, revealing that Joe Biden knew of and participated in his family’s business dealings,” the Kentucky Republican said. He said the FBI had previously defended Smirnov’s credibility. “When asked by the committee about their confidence in the confidential human source, the FBI told the committee the confidential human source was credible and trusted, had worked with the FBI for over a decade, and had been paid six figures,” Comer added. GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who publicly released the 1023 form last year after the FBI declined to do so, said his goal has been to make the Justice Department investigate the bribery allegations against the Bidens. “This indictment isn’t enough,” a Grassley spokesperson said in a statement. “The public has a right to see all the underlying evidence supporting the Biden Justice Department’s case. The Biden administration must show it’s work.” According to court records, Smirnov told an FBI agent that he had spoken with the owner of Burisma about the company’s efforts to buy a company in the United States. As part of his report to the FBI, the indictment alleges, Smirnov also noted that someone referred to as “Businessperson 1” was on the board of Burisma and was also the son of an individual referred to as “Public Official 1.” Though the indictment does not identify these individuals, sources identified “Public Official 1” as Joe Biden and “Businessperson 1” as Hunter Biden. During Joe Biden’s campaign for presidency, Smirnov allegedly submitted reports to the FBI about two meetings with Burisma executives from 2015 and 2016, during which the executives admitted that they hired Hunter Biden to “protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems.” Smirnov also allegedly reported that executives paid $5 million each to Joe and Hunter Biden while Joe Biden was vice president so that Hunter would “take care of all those issues through his dad,” referring to a criminal investigation being conducted by the then-Ukrainian prosecutor general into Burisma. “In truth and fact, the Defendant had contact with executives from Burisma in 2017, after the end of the Obama-Biden Administration and after the then Ukrainian Prosecutor General had been fired in February 2016, in other words, when [Joe Biden] had no ability to influence U.S. policy and when the Prosecutor General was no longer in office,” the indictment states. It continues, “In short, the Defendant transformed his routine and unextraordinary business contacts with Burisma in 2017 and later into bribery allegations against [Joe Biden], the presumptive nominee of one of the two major political parties for President, after expressing bias against [Joe Biden] and his candidacy.” This story has been updated with additional details.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/ukraine-aid-oversight-watchdog/index.html,"CNN — More than 400 personnel take part in the oversight of Ukraine aid, according to a new report from a US government watchdog, underscoring the massive effort to manage billions of dollars in US assistance. Congress has appropriated $113.4 billion in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , which has provided security, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other countries affected by the war. The money also supports an enlarged US military presence in Europe and the training of the Ukrainian military. To oversee the interagency effort, the inspectors general from the Defense Department, State Department, and United States Agency for International Development work with 20 other federal agencies and the Ukrainian government. In total, the report said there are more than 400 personnel working across the US, Germany, Ukraine and Europe to audit and evaluate US assistance to Ukraine. The report comes as some Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have demanded more oversight over Ukraine aid before they agree to any additional funding. Earlier this week, the Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid package that includes assistance to Ukraine, but the bill faces an uncertain future in the US House of Representatives, where Johnson has signaled he will not bring it for a vote. Johnson met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in December, saying afterwards that the Biden administration wanted “billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight.” The lengths to which the US has gone to provide that oversight is detailed in the first quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve (OAR), the name for the mission to bolster NATO and support Ukraine. The mission was first launched in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea, but it grew significantly following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Defense Department Office of the Inspector General alone has more than 200 staff members working on Ukraine oversight. Of those, 28 are in Europe, including two in Kyiv, with plans for more, the report said. The State Department watchdog has more than 100 staff members working on Ukraine oversight, three of whom are in Kyiv. The USAID watchdog has another 80 personnel working on Ukraine. In addition, law enforcement personnel from the different agencies work with Ukrainian authorities to investigate misconduct that could threaten US aid to Ukraine. The watchdogs have also set up the Ukraine Fraud and Corruption Investigative Working Group to root out and prevent corrupt dealings of US aid to Ukraine. Since the beginning of the war, these agencies have opened 57 investigations and closed 14 of them, resulting in two convictions, according to the report. In one case, investigators found that since November 2021 – three months before Russia invaded Ukraine – seven US soldiers and civilian contractors stole seven tons of fuel worth $2 million from a base in Romania used to assist Ukraine. As the war nears the two year mark, the report also details Russia’s growing reliance on foreign aid to fuel its war effort. Since the US warned a deal was possible last summer, North Korea has likely provided Russia with “millions of artillery rounds and other weapons” and may be preparing to provide other weapons as well. Iran has provided more than 1,000 one-way attack drones and multi-use drones to Russia, as well as other military equipment to use against Ukraine. Iran has also likely considered providing Russia with ballistic missiles, which CNN reported last month was a possibility."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/new-york-trump-hearing/index.html,"New York CNN — A date for Donald Trump’s first criminal trial has been set in the former president’s New York criminal hush money case . With Trump in attendance at the hearing in downtown Manhattan, New York state Judge Juan Merchan confirmed that the former president’s trial will begin on March 25, as originally scheduled, on charges that Trump falsified business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign. The decision helps solidify the former president’s legal calendar that is filling up at the same time that his 2024 campaign is closing in on the Republican nomination for president. The date of the New York trial had been in limbo in part because Trump’s federal trial in Washington, DC, on election subversion charges had initially been scheduled for March, too, but that is now on hold while Trump is attempting have the charges dismissed on claims of presidential immunity. He has asked the Supreme Court to step in, which could further delay the federal trial. That would likely make the New York hush money case the first of Trump’s election-year trials. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was the first to charge Trump last year, accusing him in a 34-count indictment of falsifying business records as part of a cover up to conceal hush money payments before the 2016 election to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had an affair with Trump. Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty. Here’s what to know heading into Thursday’s hearing: Trump sought to dismiss the case or various charges Merchan on Thursday rejected Trump’s long-shot motion to dismiss the entire case. Arguments that will likely be at the crux of the former president’s trial defense may also be ruled on. Trump and his lawyers have accused Bragg of resurrecting a “zombie” case six years too late to serve a political agenda to interfere with Trump’s 2024 presidential bid. Bragg has also endured negative speculation from critics who argue the case is thin and question whether it passes legal muster. Prosecutors allege Trump conspired with his former personal attorney Michael Cohen in a scheme to buy Daniels’ silence ahead of the 2016 election and falsified business records to hide reimbursements checks to Cohen who facilitated the $130,00 payment to Daniels. They allege Trump was aware of falsified invoices, reimbursement checks to Cohen and how those reimbursements were recorded in an attempt to commit or conceal several crimes, including election law, tax laws and the falsification of other business records. Trump’s lawyers have said he paid Cohen through his personal accounts — not involving business records. If he doesn’t toss the entire case, Trump lawyers have said Merchan should at least dismiss charges they argue are multiplicitous, because he currently faces more than one count for each of the 11 reimbursement payments to Cohen. The parties may also argue Thursday over who Trump can call in his defense case at trial, including campaign finance experts. Trump’s attorneys have also asked Merchan to consider holding a hearing over alleged grand jury leaks — the typically secretive judicial process was widely reported in national news ahead of the indictment. They also want the judge to compel more specific information from prosecutors about their evidence relating to Trump’s alleged intent to defraud. Trump’s lawyers have said the grand jury didn’t hear evidence that the former president knew about the scheme or intended to defraud anyone. Prosecutors told the judge the six-year delay was “justified” since there was an ongoing related federal investigation and Trump fought a subpoena for his records, which landed the case before the US Supreme Court. How we got here: The years-long investigation into Trump The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office officially launched its investigation into the alleged hush-money schemes under the previous DA, Cy Vance, in August 2018, the same day Cohen pleaded guilty to charges related to the Daniels payments across the street in a Manhattan federal courtroom. Under Vance, prosecutors shifted their investigation to focus on the Trump Organization’s finances and away from the repayment scheme. Bragg, who took office in January 2022, has accused Trump of leaning on his political power to avoid criminal responsibility for years and campaigned on a promise to prosecute the former president.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images Trump boards his airplane before flying to Iowa to campaign on March 13. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images In pictures: Trump in court for hush money case Prev Next A grand jury was eventually green-lit to hear the hush money case in December 2022, days before a jury in another state criminal trial convicted the Trump Organization on 17 counts related to tax fraud that slapped Trump’s company with $1.6 million in fines. The grand jury empaneled on January 23, 2023, ultimately returned the 34-count indictment in this case on March 30. If convicted on the 34 identical counts of falsifying business records, which are a class E felony, Trump could face up to 4 years in prison. But as a first-time offender, he would unlikely be sentenced to prison time. It would make him a convicted felon regardless of his sentence. As the conviction would be on state charges, Trump would not be able to pardon himself if reelected president. Trump’s first trial will begin next month as the primaries continue Merchan set the initial March 25 trial date last year, but he said they could “make any necessary” changes if there are any “actual conflicts” – a nod to the federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith. Indeed, district Judge Tanya Chutkan initially set a March 4 trial date for Trump’s federal election subversion trial in Washington, DC, which would have likely pushed back the New York trial. Now that trial is on hold while Trump’s immunity claims play out. Complicating the schedule further is the uncertainty of time for Trump’s appeal: The Supreme Court could decline to hear the case, putting the trial back in Chutkan’s hands to begin relatively quickly. But if the high court does take up Trump’s appeal, that trial is likely on hold for weeks, if not months, while the presidential immunity issue is decided. The New York case in many ways fell into the background last year following Trump’s arraignment last spring. Smith brought charges against Trump for his alleged mishandling of classified documents last June and again for alleged election subversion in August, and then Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis charged Trump later that month in a sprawling racketeering case involving Trump and 18 co-defendants. But now the New York trial is primed to be the first where a jury will decide Trump’s guilt or innocence. Now that the March 25 date remains in effect, it will take place as Trump is collecting delegates in presidential primaries for the Republican nomination and preparing for a potential general election rematch against President Joe Biden. It’s not clear yet whether Trump would be required to attend every day of the trial or if he can ask not to appear. His attendance for Thursday’s hearing was waived but he chose to attend, rather than going to Georgia to watch a hearing seeking to disqualify Willis from his Georgia case. Trump is only an observer at this hearing Trump on Thursday is sitting in his fourth different courtroom this year, including three for separate cases in New York. He attended closing arguments last month in his New York civil fraud trial before Judge Arthur Engoron – in which the judge is expected to rule on Friday – as well as testified and attended multiple days at the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, where a jury found Trump liable for $83.3 million in damages. Trump also sat in for oral arguments at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on his immunity claims in January, though he did not speak or have a role in that hearing. In both prior New York cases, Trump found ways to make his presence felt in the courtroom, both on the witness stand and from the defendant’s table. In the defamation case, district Judge Lewis Kaplan restricted what Trump could testify to before the jury, and at one point he warned Trump that he could be removed from the courtroom if he kept up his audible commentary during Carroll’s testimony. And in the New York civil trial, Trump’s time on the witness stand in November was a spectacle, where the former president used the opportunity to bash the trial and the charges brought by the New York attorney general. During closing arguments last month, Engoron told Trump’s lawyer he could not speak as part of the defense case – but Trump found a way to deliver a five-minute monologue, anyway. Speaking to reporters ahead of his appearance, Trump — who has similarly used other court proceedings to generate publicity for his campaign — said the case against him is politically motivated and amounts to “election interference.” “This is just a way of hurting me in the election because I’m leading by a lot,” Trump said."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/jared-kushner-trump-second-term/index.html,"CNN — Donald Trump ’s son-in-law Jared Kushner said Tuesday he does not plan on serving in a second Trump administration as he is committed to focusing on his business ventures. “Nothing in my life has gone according to the plans I’ve set, and that’s been the only consistent thing,” Kushner said at an Axios event in Miami, before emphasizing that he’s been “very clear” in his desire to focus on his private equity firm “at this phase” in his life. Kushner served as a senior adviser in his father-in-law’s administration. He transitioned to the financial sector after leaving the White House, starting a Miami-based investment firm called Affinity Partners Kushner said Tuesday that he’s enjoyed having his family “out of the spotlight” after he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, saw their White House roles end after her father left office. He also said that he was “right now” committed to “my investors, to my firm, to my employees, to my partners, and that’s what I’m planning to do.” Pressed on whether he would turn down an administration job from his father-in-law if asked directly, Kushner answered “yes.” He said Trump has had “time to really reflect” on his third presidential campaign .

During Trump’s White House tenure, Kushner’s fingerprints were on many, if not all , of the administration’s agenda items – from the border wall and immigration to relations with China, criminal justice, trade agreements between Mexico and Canada and the United States, the Middle East and, ultimately, the White House’s coronavirus response. Kushner also headed up the White House Office of American Innovation, whose goal was to modernize government technology. Prior to working in the White House, Kushner had no political experience. He served as CEO of his family’s real estate development firm, Kushner Properties. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Kate Bennett contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/new-york-redistricting-house-map/index.html,"CNN — A bipartisan redistricting commission in New York approved a new congressional map Thursday that could help Empire State Democrats make slight gains in this year’s US House elections but falls well short of an electoral windfall for the party. New York is expected to be an epicenter in the battle for the House this fall, with Republicans’ narrow majority on the line. The GOP flipped four seats in the state in the 2022 midterms, gains that helped the party win control of the chamber. The new map, approved 9-1 by the New York State Independent Redistricting Commission, now moves for final action to the Democratic-controlled state legislature, where its fate is unclear. Several Democrats on Thursday said they were still examining the commission’s work product and remained noncommittal. “The Senate Majority is eager to review the proposed map,” Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the top Democrat in the state Senate, said in a statement. “We plan to discuss and decide our subsequent actions soon.” Freshman Republican Brandon Williams – who represents parts of central New York – would see the biggest change to his district under the map approved Thursday. His new seat would include more territory favorable to Democrats – likely resulting in a Democratic pickup. But, under the compromise crafted by the commission, two Hudson Valley seats – held by Republican Marc Molinaro and Democrat Pat Ryan – each appear to have grown safer for the incumbents. And, notably, the commission’s map leaves largely undisturbed other House districts in the New York City suburbs, which have been viewed as potential battlegrounds in November. The US Capitol is seen at sunrise in Washington, DC, on October 18, 2023. Jose Luis Magana/AP Related article Redistricting fights in these states could determine which party controls the US House Ken Jenkins, the commission’s chairman and a Democrat, described Thursday’s vote as “ultimately a victory for the commission process and for small-d democratic participation in the state of New York.” The disputes over New York’s congressional districts have been closely followed in Washington, where the outcome of redistricting fights across the country could shape which party controls the House after November’s elections. The GOP’s majority in the chamber narrowed further this week when Democrat Tom Suozzi won a special election to succeed expelled former Republican Rep. George Santos in New York’s 3rd Congressional District on Long Island. The new map eased GOP fears that it could have been a major boon for Democrats, and a top New York Republican called on state lawmakers to accept the commission’s approach. “The State Legislature should adopt these district lines without change,” state GOP chairman Ed Cox said in a statement. “The voting public deserves to have continuity in district boundaries and to avoid chaos.” But Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, urged caution, saying the map would require “a thorough examination” by the legislature. If approved by the legislature, the New York map would represent a far more modest outcome than what occurred last fall in North Carolina – where the GOP-controlled legislature passed a heavily gerrymandered map that is poised to ensure Republican dominance in the state’s 14-member congressional delegation. The New York commission’s action on Thursday came after the state’s highest court tasked the panel with drawing a new map – following a protracted legal battle. A state court judge had overseen the process of drawing the map used in the 2022 elections after the redistricting commission had failed to agree on new lines after the 2020 census. Democrats in the state legislature have final say over the map, holding the power to reject the commission’s plan and take over the line-drawing themselves. But that risks triggering another round of legal fights, with Republicans likely to challenge any map they view as an overly aggressive gerrymander. In a statement, Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which supports the GOP’s redistricting efforts, said the commission’s redistricting process “should have never been reopened” and called the panel’s map “a step back.” As part of the compromise approved Thursday, the 16th Congressional District, which includes a slice of New York City and parts of Westchester County, remained virtually unchanged. Two-term Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman is facing a primary challenge from George Latimer, the Westchester County executive who previously served in the New York State Assembly.

Michael Starghill Jr. Related article Redistricting fights across South put future of Voting Rights Act in the spotlight again Latimer said Thursday he was moving forward with his bid and is confident that the state legislature would complete the process of approving the map. “Regardless of the timing or the ultimate disposition of the lines, we look forward to continuing to bring our message of progressive results that benefit the people of our area, in whatever neighborhood they live and whatever jurisdictions are ultimately assigned to CD-16,” Latimer said in a statement. New York faces a court-ordered deadline of February 28 to complete its redistricting process, but it was unclear Thursday when the state legislature would next meet to consider the map. Time is running short. State lawmakers in New York are scheduled to be on recess next week, and House candidates are slated to begin collecting signatures for petitions to run for office on February 27. That leaves little time for lawmakers to approve – and for Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to sign into law – new district lines. Approving the map would require the support of a two-thirds majority in each chamber, noted Jeffrey Wice, an expert on redistricting and an adjunct professor at New York Law School. And some legislators “don’t know what to make” of the map at the moment. “It’s still not over yet,” Wice said. This story has been updated with additional information."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/matt-rosendale-montana-senate/index.html,"CNN — Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale has ended his bid for Senate less than a week after launching his campaign, citing former President Donald Trump ’s endorsement of his Republican primary opponent. “I have long been a supporter of the President, and remain so. But I have been forced to calculate what my chances of success would be with Trump supporting my opponent,” Rosendale said in a statement Thursday. He added that with a lack of resources and the former president’s endorsement “the hill was just too steep.” Just hours after Rosendale announced his run Friday, Trump endorsed retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who has the backing of several high-profile Republicans, in the race to take on vulnerable Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. However, Trump added that he would back Rosendale should he run for reelection to his House seat in Montana’s 2nd Congressional District. The congressman did not say Thursday whether he plans to do so, and a number of prominent Montana Republicans have already filed for his deep-red seat. Politico was first to report that Rosendale was ending his Senate bid. With Rosendale’s exit, Republican will avoid what was expected to be a contentious primary. Several Republicans — including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Montana Sen. Steve Daines, who leads the Senate GOP campaign arm — have backed Sheehy as the party looks to flip the chamber in November. Montana, along with West Virginia and Ohio, is one of three Senate seats Democrats are defending in states twice won by Trump. Rosendale’s candidacy sparked concern among Republicans that if he — a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus who lost an earlier Senate bid to Tester in 2018 — emerged as the primary winner, they would be far less likely to win the seat in November. First elected to the House in 2020, Rosendale previously served in the Montana Legislature and as state auditor. He moved to Montana in 2002, and the former land developer’s Maryland roots were a frequent target of Democratic attacks in his 2018 race against Tester, which the incumbent won by less than 4 points.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/bureau-of-prisons-inspector-general-report/index.html,"Washington CNN — Chronic failures by the Bureau of Prisons contributed to the deaths of hundreds of federal prison inmates, the Department of Justice’s Inspector General said in a blistering report released Thursday. The report found that recurring failures within the Bureau of Prisons, such as inaccurate mental health screenings or prison staff missing inmate rounds, led to inmates dying in federal custody. Longstanding institutional issues also limited BOP’s ability to investigate inmate deaths and prevent similar conditions in the future, it said. For years, the embattled Bureau of Prisons has been the subject of accusations by politicians, prisoner advocacy groups for mistreating or neglecting inmates. The Justice Department itself has issued scathing rebukes against BOP, outlining serious mistakes that have led to the deaths of high-profile inmates like notorious Boston gangster and convicted murderer James “Whitey” Bulger , who was killed shortly after being transferred to a new prison, and financier Jeffrey Epstein , who died by suicide in his jail cell. But the circumstances that led to Bulger and Epstein’s deaths are emblematic of wide-ranging and recurring issues within the federal prison system that affect hundreds of inmates across the country, the DOJ’s Office of Inspector General found in its report that outlined a system in crisis failing to protect its charges. The 100-page report analyzed the circumstances of 344 inmates who died by suicide, homicide, accidents or other unknown factors between 2014 and 2021. The OIG recommended several changes to BOP procedure, including developing strategies to ensure that inmate mental health is properly evaluated, that prison staff is taught to use defibrillators and naloxone, and to develop procedures that require inmate death records to be consistently completed and collected. In response to the report, a BOP spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that BOP “acknowledges and concurs with the need for improvements” and is “dedicated to implementing these changes to ensure the safety and well-being of those in our custody.” Issues with existing BOP standards In several of the homicide and suicide cases examined by the OIG, inmates died after prison staff failed to meet standards outlined within BOPs own policies. The report pointed to correctional officers who didn’t complete their assigned duties, improperly filled out paperwork, didn’t bring life-saving equipment when responding to an emergency, gave inaccurate or unclear information on the radio to medical staff, or didn’t know how to administer overdose medication naloxone. For example, correctional staff failed to conduct the required rounds or inmate counts in restrictive housing units before the deaths of at least 86 inmates. In another 17 cases, staff failed to search or did not sufficiently search inmates cells, allowing them to possess excess medication, bed sheets or razors. Investigators pointed to Epstein, noting that before his death he was able to amass an “excessive amount of linens.” In another case, prison staff claimed to have searched an inmate’s cell three times without finding contraband. Days later, the inmate died by a drug overdose after amassing more than 1,000 pills in their cell, the report says. Some staff also allowed inmates to evade metal detectors, the report said, including in 11 homicide cases where inmates weren’t searched, were allowed to walk around metal detectors or not confronted after setting off metal detectors. The OIG also said that guidelines to help prison staff investigate deaths once they had occurred often were adhered to. BOP was “unable to produce documentation required by its own policy for 43% of the inmate deaths in our scope,” the report says, including 117 cases where the BOP failed to acquire death certificates. Prison suicide Recurring violations of BOP’s own policies and operational failures inside prisons led to a staggering amount of inmate suicides, the OIG found, accounting for more than half of the deaths analyzed in their report. Prison staff frequently did not properly evaluate inmates’ mental health, often categorizing inmates who later died by suicide with little to no mental health risks. Other inmates with documented mental health risks were isolated in a special housing unit (SHU) or did not receive the counseling they were supposed to and later died by suicide. In one example highlighted in the report, prison health services staff did not refer an inmate who had swallowed razor blades for psychological help. The inmate went on to be repeatedly placed in the SHU for engaging in violence without the knowledge of the mental health staff at the facility, where he later died by hanging. Staffing crisis A staggering lack of health care and correctional staff within the prisons has also led to a diminished quality of inmate care, the OIG found. In one particularly egregious example, the OIG described the lack of access to healthcare in the notorious Federal Correctional Institution Thomson in Illinois. When the OIG visited Thomson in 2022, according to the report, it had not had an on-side full-time physician for over a year. Additionally, nearly half of its nursing positions were vacant, the report said. These vacancies can drastically affect quality of health care, the report said, or overwhelm staff so dramatically that they quit. Staffing shortages have also forced some institutions to mandate available staff to work overtime shifts, in some cases working 16-hour days several times a week. Other staff members are asked to augment their responsibilities, at times forcing non-correctional officer staff to perform correctional duties – including one case where psychologists were assigned to correctional posts for more than two months.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/white-house-russia-anti-satellite/index.html,"Washington CNN — The White House on Thursday confirmed that the national security threat flagged by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee the previous day is related to “an anti-satellite capability that Russia is developing,” but sought to soothe concerns about the danger it presents to the United States. “This is not an active capability that’s been deployed,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. “And though Russia’s pursuit of this particular capability is troubling there was no immediate threat to anyone’s safety.” “We are not talking about a weapon that can be used to attack human beings or cause physical destruction here on Earth,” Kirby added. Kirby’s comments came a day after the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, ignited a firestorm on Capitol Hill when he issued a cryptic statement announcing that the panel had “information concerning a serious national security threat.” The lack of immediate details about the nature of the threat left many filling in their own blanks about its severity and imminence. Turner has faced withering criticism, even from members of his own party, for publicizing the committee’s knowledge in a vague post to social media, with Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida accusing him of “gaslighting the country,” and Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee demanding an investigation into Turner. Both Gaetz and Ogles said they believe Turner was motivated to make the information public to rouse support for additional funding for Ukraine in its war against Russia. The Kremlin repeated that talking point on Thursday, Reuters reported . Kirby responded to the Kremlin’s claim with one word: “Bollocks.” He later added that the US is still in the process of reaching out to Russia for conversations on Moscow’s anti-satellite capabilities. “We’ll have to see” whether public disclosure of the threat might make those conversations more difficult, he said. Turner has publicly supported continuing to fund the Ukraine war effort, even as former President Donald Trump has supported the GOP push to oppose a $60 billion aid package to support Ukraine. Other members of the Intelligence Committee came to Turner’s defense. Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw defended Turner’s decision to publicize the information. Referencing the allegations that Turner planned the release to coincide with efforts to provide additional funding, Crenshaw said the timing was a coincidence. “There was notifications from the intelligence community that made it just clearer now than before,” Crenshaw said. “This was just the time.” The post from Turner called on President Joe Biden to declassify “all information” related to the threat. Kirby said the US intelligence community had “serious concerns” about a broad declassification of intelligence related to the threat. He added that private engagement, “rather than immediately publicizing the intelligence, could be a much more effective approach.” The United States has been aware of Russia’s pursuit of anti-satellite capability going back “many, many months, if not a few years,” Kirby said, and Biden has been briefed on it since the outset of his term. He said it was only in recent weeks that the intelligence community has been “able to assess with a higher sense of confidence exactly how Russia continues to pursue it.” As to whether the intelligence should be downgraded, Kirby said the administration has been following a rigorous process, and wouldn’t be “knocked off” that by Turner’s decision to publicize the threat on Wednesday. He denied the administration provided a green light to Turner to make the information public. While Kirby said the Russian capabilities do not pose a threat to human life, an anti-satellite weapon placed in orbit around Earth would pose a significant danger to US nuclear command and control satellites, Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN on Wednesday. The US relies on such satellites – which he called “essential” – to ensure constant, seamless control over its nuclear arsenal. Russia has pursued counterspace systems designed to neutralize US military and commercial space systems for years, according to a 2022 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report on space security. Russian doctrine called for being able to target an enemy’s satellites from the ground, air, cyber and space, using attacks that range from temporary jamming to outright destruction.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/emhoff-meeting-jewish-arab-youth-gaza/index.html,"CNN — Second gentleman Doug Emhoff slipped into New York on Thursday for a small meeting with youth leaders selected from across the Jewish American, Muslim American and Palestinian American communities, marking the administration’s latest move in its evolving response to the Israel-Hamas war . The event, hosted by United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Rashad Hussain, the US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, was kept quiet by administration officials hoping to facilitate a conversation, rather than a debate or another opportunity for the protests that have followed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris across the country. But Emhoff is not involved with administration policy, so the discussion was not about a ceasefire nor negotiations over a hostage release nor the White House’s maneuvering with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Nor was it about ongoing political fallout, according to a person in the room. It focused on how the situation has affected people in America, billed as “a roundtable discussion on the sharp rise in Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate after the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel.” In January, the Anti-Defamation League recorded a 361% rise in reported antisemitic incidents in the three months after the Hamas attack began on October 7 compared to the same period in 2022. In November, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it had received an “unprecedented” rise in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents in the month following the start of the war. “These communities have felt real pain, fear, and isolation,” Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement to CNN. “In this moment in which it’s all too easy to focus on what divides us, we must carve out moments like today’s roundtable to remember what unites us: to find shared humanity, and shared purpose, in one another’s stories, and work together to create a lasting peace for all.” Though he was working on the issue before, Emhoff’s portfolio as second gentleman has increasingly been consumed with countering hate across the country since October 7. He’s had community conversations with leaders in Michigan, California and at Cornell University in New York. But Thursday’s event – coordinated by Andrew Weinstein, who was appointed by President Joe Biden in 2022 to serve as a public delegate to the United Nations – was the first structured specifically around youth leaders, and across Jewish Americans and Arab Americans at once. The event itself was kept closed to the public and press, but the person in the room described an honest conversation defined by participants talking about their own experiences over the last few months, with Emhoff, Thomas-Greenfield and Hussain mostly listening. Emhoff finished by talking about the need to keep building coalitions and executing on the national strategy to combat antisemitism and the coming strategy on combating Islamophobia, the person in the room said. An aide to the US mission to the United Nations explained that the names of the participants were kept private to protect sensitive discussions. “Obviously everyone didn’t agree on policy, but everyone agreed on the need to combat hate and to work against dehumanization,” said another person familiar with the event."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/trump-makes-final-pitch-to-supreme-court-in-fraught-immunity-case/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch Thursday to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. “There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing . “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.” Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument. The Supreme Court is expected to decide on Trump’s request within a few days. With Trump’s final brief in hand, a question of timing is now squarely before the high court. The justices could deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue or they could agree to further consider his case. A view of the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday morning January 4, 2024 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Related article Special counsel urges Supreme Court to deny Trump’s request for delay in immunity case The first outcome would clear the way for a US District court in Washington, DC, to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to resolve before the November election. The second could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months. On Monday, Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down last week that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. “Without immunity from criminal prosecution, the presidency as we know it will cease to exist,” Trump told the Supreme Court. Two days later – ahead of deadline – Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause. “The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy,” Smith wrote in a filing Wednesday. “The public interest in a prompt trial is at its zenith where, as here, a former president is charged with conspiring to subvert the electoral process so that he could remain in office.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/white-house-letter-special-counsel/index.html,"Washington CNN — The White House wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland the day before special counsel Robert Hur’s report was released, vehemently objecting to aspects of the report – including its “multiple denigrating statements” about the president’s memory. The letter was the culmination of a months-long attempt by Biden’s team to weigh in on the investigation into President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents through letters to Hur and eventually to Hur’s boss, the attorney general. Ultimately, Hur did not appear to heed calls by Biden’s lawyers to produce a narrow and concise report limited to the facts of the charging decision. Instead, the 388-page report — which declined to bring charges — sparked a political firestorm by making repeated references to Biden’s inability to recall dates and details. “We object to the multiple denigrating statements about President Biden’s memory which violate longstanding DOJ practice and policy,” Biden’s personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, and White House counsel, Edward Siskel, wrote in a three-page letter to Garland on February 7. “This report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” The lawyers wrote that “a global and pejorative judgment on the President’s powers of recollection in general is uncalled for and unfounded.” In the February 7 letter, Biden’s lawyers likened Hur’s efforts in his report to those of James Comey, the FBI director in 2016 who criticized then-candidate Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server, despite not bringing charges. The lawyers wrote Hur’s report “mirrors one of the most widely-recognized examples in recent history of inappropriate prosecutor criticism of uncharged conduct.” “The FBI and DOJ personnel’s criticism of uncharged conduct during investigations in connection with the 2016 election was found to violate ‘long-standing Department practice and protocol,’” the lawyers wrote. Politico and The New York Times published copies of the letter. The White House counsel’s office declined to comment. The letter underscores the deep anger generated by Hur’s report inside the White House and lays bare tensions between Biden’s team and Garland. CNN has previously reported that frustrations have run high inside the White House regarding some of Garland’s decisions related to the classified documents matter. The letter to Garland also objected to Hur’s characterization of Biden’s practice of retaining personal diaries, saying that even though “prior Presidents have done exactly the same thing,” the special counsel described the behavior as “totally irresponsible.” Hur’s report, which concluded that criminal charges were not warranted against Biden regarding his handling of classified documents, made numerous references to the president’s memory and recall issues that were allegedly exhibited during his multi-hour interview with Hur in October. Since the report’s release, the White House and the president’s lawyers have strenuously objected to the handling of the investigation and, in particular, the references to Biden’s memory issues as gratuitous and inappropriate. A day after Hur’s report was released publicly, a top Justice Department official responded by defending the document and its inclusion of details about Biden’s memory. “The context in which this information is used in the report makes it appropriate under Department policy and the Special Counsel regulations. The identified language is neither gratuitous nor unduly prejudicial because it is not offered to criticize or demean the President,” wrote Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer to Biden’s team. Weinsheimer, the department’s top career official, also pushed back on Biden’s lawyers’ comparison to Comey, calling it “inapt,” as Comey was an FBI director and not a special counsel. He said Hur’s report was “readily distinguishable from Director Comey’s press conference” about the Clinton email server. On February 12, four days after the Hur report was released, Bauer and Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, responded to Weinsheimer – to once again disagree with the DOJ’s assessment that Hur’s report was consistent with the department’s policy and practice. In this letter, the lawyers cited – among others – former Attorney General Eric Holder, who said that the Hur report “contains way too many gratuitous remarks and is flatly inconsistent with long standing DOJ traditions.” This story has been updated with additional information."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/mike-turner-republican-reaction/index.html,"House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner is facing sharp criticism – including from within his own party – as some GOP lawmakers are complaining that a statement the Ohio Republican made Wednesday was alarmist, “constituted poor judgement” and should be investigated. Some of Turner’s colleagues believe he was drawing attention to a Russian threat to build support for Ukraine aid and others believe it was his effort to push for his version of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act overhaul that was facing a vote later in the day. “It’s f***ing bullsh*t,” one prominent House Republican told CNN of Turner’s move. “He ought to lose his job. He did that to get his way on FISA.” Others were just as unnerved by the move. “I don’t know what his motives were it just to me, it just looks bad,” Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I have a bad feeling about this.” Another Tennessee Republican, Rep. Andy Ogles, sent a scathing letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday calling for an investigation into Turner for his vague statements, calling his disclosure “reckless” and asserting he disregarded of the consequences. “This act constituted poor judgement at a minimum and a complete breach of trust influenced by the pursuit of a political agenda at a maximum … it is with great reticence that I formally request an inquiry as to any impact the Chairman’s statements may have had on U.S. foreign and domestic policy,” Ogles wrote. CNN has reached out to Johnson for comment on the letter. Not long after Turner released his statement warning of a “serious national security threat,” Johnson arranged a last-minute news conference in the Capitol to make clear there’s “no need for public alarm” and clarifying he had already requested a briefing on the matter a month ago. Turner did not give the House speaker’s office a heads up prior to making his public statement characterizing the matter as a “serious national security threat,” according to a source familiar with the matter. Turner did, however, inform Johnson he would be requesting that the Biden administration declassify information about the threat, another source said. GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas, a member of the Intelligence Committee, defended Turner’s actions and blasted members who want him investigated. Asked about the letter from Ogles, Crenshaw said, Ogles “needs to f***ing check himself.” “He doesn’t know what he is talking about,” Crenshaw said. “It’s absurd. It’s a deeply absurd action. I am tired of people making extremely passionate, opinionated actions based on no knowledge.” Asked about some of the theories members are floating that Turner was using his position to try and drum up support for Ukraine aid and other theories as to why Turner released the statement, Crenshaw said the timing was just coincidence. “It’s coincidence,” he said. “There was notifications from the intelligence community that made it just clearer now than before. This was just the time.” Turner issued a statement defending his decision to make the national security threat available to members, but the statement does not address why Turner decided to make his statement public, which has caused backlash. Turner said he worked with the Biden administration to notify Congress about the national security threat and that the administration cleared his statement with the top Democrat on the panel before it got sent to lawmakers. The committee voted on Tuesday to release the information to lawmakers, and Turner said that vote was 23-1. Turner’s initial statement came hours before the House was scheduled to take a vote related to reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a vote that was later postponed due to opposition from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members had been pushing for amendment votes. Members of the Freedom Caucus later tanked a procedural vote on unrelated legislation Wednesday evening. Ogles tied Turner’s statement to trying to drum up support for passing the FISA package. “In hindsight, it has become clear that the intent was not to ensure the safety of our homeland and the American people, but rather to ensure additional funding for Ukraine and passage of an unreformed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).” GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz accused Turner of “gaslighting the country” about the seriousness of the security threat members were briefed on Thursday in order to promote Ukraine funding. “We put out our concern with Chairman Turner gaslighting the country on these things,” Gaetz told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I worry that the motivation to draw so much attention to this is less about intelligence and national security and more about a politician who wants to send $60 billion to Ukraine,” he said, “and wants to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that we want to see substantially curtailed because of the spying abuses.” CNN reported Wednesday that the US has new intelligence on Russian military capabilities related to its efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space, according to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence. The intelligence was briefed to Congress and key US allies, and some lawmakers say it is serious enough that it should be declassified and made public. One Democratic member with deep national security experience said Wednesday that they had never before received that kind of urgent summons over a national security matter during their time in Congress — and that the intelligence they saw when they arrived was not urgent enough to justify Turner’s comments.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/texas-immigration-law-doj/index.html,"CNN — A federal judge on Thursday expressed concern and skepticism over a controversial law that makes entering Texas illegally a state crime while hearing oral arguments over a motion for a preliminary injunction to block the law. The measure, SB4, which is set to go into effect on March 5, grants local and state law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and state judges the ability to issue orders to remove them to Mexico. The Department of Justice sued the state , arguing the federal government has exclusive authority to enforce immigration law. US District Judge David Ezra emphasized that he was sympathetic to the state’s concerns about the complicated situation at the border and the issues plaguing the country’s immigration system, making it clear that something must be done to improve the nation’s immigration laws. He also added that he’s served as a federal judge in several cities along the border, including San Diego and Del Rio. But Ezra was not shy in critiquing the bill passed by the state’s legislature last year and fully embraced by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott . Civil rights groups and immigration advocacy groups who are also part of the lawsuit have warned that the bill will separate families, lead to racial profiling and make undocumented migrants who are already in the US fearful of reporting crimes. Ezra sharply questioned several provisions within the law and flat out rejected the state’s argument that an “invasion” was taking place at the Texas-Mexico border. The state argued in the Austin courtroom that SB4 is complementary — not in conflict — with federal law and that Texas is “entitled to defend itself from an invasion,” especially from what it called a “full-scale invasion of transnational criminal cartels.” While he acknowledged the role cartels play in the border crisis, Ezra pushed back at the notion that an influx of migrants constituted an “invasion.” “I really do not see any evidence that Texas is at war,” he said, though he said the state is “definitely under pressure.” Ezra also speculated that if he were to rule that SB4 was “perfectly fine,” it could ignite a domino effect of other states creating their own interpretations of federal immigration law — a situation he described as a “nightmare.” Ryan Walters, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, pointed out that states along the border largely enforced their own immigration laws and deported migrants until the late 1800s. Ezra countered that because the states were “doing their own thing,” Congress stepped in and created a unified law over who can come into the country. Ezra said the law still needs more work, “but that doesn’t mean the law we have isn’t enforceable.” Further, he said the removal provisions in the Texas legislation would burden state judges with making decisions that typically fall within the jurisdiction of immigration judges. He worried parts of the law would confuse judges over whether to follow state or federal statutes, especially when it comes to a migrant who’s legally seeking asylum while also facing felony prosecution from the state. “It is a quandary of some proportion,” Ezra said. The state argued that arresting migrants is not unprecedented for the state, as it’s been arresting migrants for trespassing for more than two years. But the judge argued there was a difference, saying SB4 “goes far beyond that” by allowing a judge to order a migrant to be removed once prosecuted. Ezra said he would rule “as quickly as I possibly can,” assuring both parties he would give enough time for either side to file an appeal. The judge made clear he did not see this case ending quickly. “I would not be surprised at all if this case finds its way to the Supreme Court,” he said.

A Chinese green energy firm backed by Michigan's state government is tearing down trees to make way for a proposed electric vehicle (EV) battery plant designed to help the state meet its climate goals. Gotion Inc. — whose parent company is Hefei, China-based Gotion High-Tech — said it has initiated its tree-cutting process this week to make way for its controversial EV project in Mecosta County, Michigan, which has received support from Democrats and climate activists, but opposition from Republicans and national security experts. The firm said the process is legal and pushed back against concerns raised by locals. ""It’s unfortunate that some extremist groups have targeted Mecosta County area businesses that want to work with Gotion Inc. to grow and strengthen jobs in our region,"" said Chuck Thelen, Gotion’s vice president of North American operations. ""A small minority of people continue to spread misinformation and manufacture lies about Gotion Inc., which invariably leads some residents to act out and make threats,"" he continued.

Gretchen Whitmer delivers her State of the State address to a joint session of the House and Senate on January 24 in Lansing, Michigan. (AP Photo/Al Goldis) Gotion first unveiled its development plans for the project in October 2022 alongside Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer , agreeing to invest $2.4 billion in two 550,000-square-foot production plants and other supporting facilities across a large plot of land in Green Charter Township. Then, in August, the firm purchased 270 acres of land for the project, including land zoned for industrial, agricultural and residential use. However, amid increasing opposition to the project over Gotion's ties to the Chinese Communist Party , the project has faced delays even as the Whitmer administration has earmarked nearly $200 million in taxpayer funding for the development. While mass tree-cutting to make way for construction was originally slated to occur late last year, the process was delayed until this week. 120 REPUBLICANS JOIN EFFORT OPPOSING BIDEN'S 'DE FACTO EV MANDATE' Crain's Detroit Business reported earlier this week that one local logging business had been awarded the contract but ultimately backed out over the sustained local opposition, saying they didn't want to be ""tied up in a bunch of gobbledygook.""

EXCLUSIVE: House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio , cheered the news that multiple major U.S. banks and financial institutions are leaving a $68 trillion climate alliance founded at the United Nations. In a series of unexpected announcements on Thursday, JPMorgan Chase, the world's largest bank, and State Street Global Advisors, an institutional investor with $3.5 trillion in assets under management, withdrew from the so-called Climate Action 100+ investor group. At the same time, BlackRock, which has more than $10 trillion in assets under management, dramatically scaled back its involvement in the alliance. ""This is great news because you're supposed to make investment decisions based on just good common business sense, your fiduciary responsibility to your investors, not based on left-wing woke politics,"" Jordan told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""So, yeah, this is a win for America, a win for the economy, a win for Americans and investors and, more importantly, it's a win for freedom."" ""The folks who are involved in these banks are smart people, successful people. They've done well. I think deep down they know decisions should be based on the market, on principles of capitalism, not on politics,"" he added. CONSUMER GROUP REVEALS LEFT-WING GROUPS INCREASINGLY USING COURTS TO PUSH GREEN NEW DEAL Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, has led an investigation into major banks and nonprofit climate groups over their coordination on net-zero ambitions. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Under Jordan's leadership, the House Judiciary Committee launched a sprawling investigation into what he dubbed the ""climate-obsessed corporate ‘cartel’"" in December 2022 as Republicans prepared to take majority control of the chamber. The panel's main objective has been to probe whether the financial sector, aided by nonprofit activist climate groups, are violating U.S. antitrust laws. As part of the initial effort, Jordan and several fellow House Republicans penned a letter to the Steering Committee for Climate Action 100+, demanding information about the coalition’s network of influence. The letter stated that the alliance ""seems to work like a cartel to ‘ensure the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take necessary action on climate change.’"" BILLIONAIRE-FUELED ROCKEFELLER FUND COORDINATED CLIMATE LAWSUITS WITH DEM STATE AG: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS Since then, Jordan's committee has expanded the investigation, firing off inquiries into BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, in addition to nonprofits Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. And late last year he issued subpoenas to BlackRock and State Street, compelling the production of documents related to his investigation into potential antitrust violations. ""I think we've done more subpoenas and more interviews and written more letters than probably most of the rest of Congress combined,"" Jordan told Fox News Digital. ""We have been pushing for stopping this kind of coordination and collusion that we think is harmful to the economy, to freedom, to investors,"" the Judiciary Committee chair continued. ""So, you know, we're just doing our job, and we're happy to see that three huge banks — the decision they made today, and I think, as I said before, it's a win for the country."" Activists stage a protest outside BlackRock headquarters in New York City on May 25, 2022. (Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) Climate Action 100+ was formally established in December 2017 at the United Nations as a way of aligning the world's largest private sector financiers of greenhouse gas emitters . Since the association was created, it has grown to include more than 700 financial institutions that are collectively responsible for a staggering $68 trillion in assets under management. The group, which is overseen by a nongovernmental steering committee comprised of ESG activists, calls for members to engage companies on ""improving climate change governance,"" curbing carbon emissions and strengthening climate-related financial disclosure policies. Its actions have largely taken aim at investments that benefit the oil and gas industry while boosting green energy investment strategies. MEET THE LITTLE-KNOWN GROUP FUNDED BY LEFT-WING DARK MONEY THAT IS SHAPING FEDERAL CLIMATE POLICY But in June 2023, Climate Action 100+ unveiled its ""phase 2"" strategy, which calls for member investors to actively engage with companies to reduce their carbon footprint. That program, slated to be implemented in the coming months, sparked concerns from State Street and BlackRock. ""After careful review, State Street Global Advisors has concluded the enhanced Climate Action 100+ Phase 2 requirements for signatories will not be consistent with our independent approach to proxy voting and portfolio company engagement,"" State Street Global Advisors said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""As a result, we have decided to withdraw from Climate Action 100+."" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, left, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (Getty Images) BlackRock similarly said in a note Thursday that the ""phase 2"" strategy caused it to withdraw its U.S. business from Climate Action 100+ in recent weeks, instead shifting involvement in the alliance to its smaller international entity where a majority of clients are pursuing decarbonization goals. ""This new strategy will require signatories to make an overarching commitment to use client assets to pursue emissions reductions in investee companies through stewardship engagement,"" the firm stated. ""In our judgment, making this new commitment across our assets under management would raise legal considerations, particularly in the U.S."" ""The majority of the firm’s clients who are seeking investment solutions that help them meet their climate, transition and decarbonization commitments are clients of our international businesses,"" it added. ""To align with these clients and funds, we have transferred our membership in CA100+ to BlackRock International. BlackRock Inc. is no longer a member of CA100+."" UNITED NATIONS FOUNDATION IS QUIETLY FUELING CLIMATE POLICY, FUNDING STAFF IN DEM STATES And JPMorgan Chase separately explained that it quit the global investor group because of the expansion of its own in-house sustainability team and the establishment of its climate-risk framework in recent years. The most recent United Nations climate summit took place in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in late November and early December last year. The conference included various agreements from financial institutions to curb investments in the fossil fuel sector. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Climate Action 100+, in addition to other global climate alliances and investor networks, has also drawn the ire of Republican states , which have argued that their activities may infringe on government policymaking. They have also warned that such associations are harming domestic energy companies that employ thousands of Americans and ensure low consumer prices. As a result, state attorneys general, financial officers and agriculture commissioners have banded together in recent months to threaten legal action related to nonprofit climate alliances and banks' involvement in such groups. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""More than 700 investors are committed to managing climate risk and preserving shareholder value through their participation in the initiative,"" a spokesperson for Climate Action 100+ told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

A group of House Democrats is unveiling their own plan for border security and immigration reform, another sign the left is gradually growing to embrace discussions of how to solve the U.S. migrant crisis. The New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of nearly 100 lawmakers that bills itself as ""center-left,"" revealed a framework that called for increased manpower at the southern border and within immigration courts, as well as more pathways for legal residency and citizenship for workers, ""Dreamers"" and others. Among other measures, the plan would permanently authorize a program to allow international medical students studying in the U.S. to legally stay in the country after completing their degrees. It would also expand legal pathways for migrant farmworkers and establish a new non-immigrant work visa category for U.S. industries experiencing personnel shortages. It also would include a legal pathway for people who came here illegally but have been working and paying taxes for at least five years, provided they pay a fine and pass a criminal background check. REPUBLICANS PROBE DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER ROLE IN HOUSING MIGRANTS ON FEDERAL LANDS New Democrat Coalition Chair Annie Kuster unveiled her group's plan for an immigration and border security overhaul. (Getty Images) On the enforcement front, the plan called for increasing the number of border agents at ports of entry by at least 500 and increasing some Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers’ pay. The Democrat framework would also create an independent judiciary system for immigration courts and increase the number of judges to cut down on the current backlog of cases. To manage the flow of migrants coming to the U.S. to be processed for asylum, it would also create ""new regional processing centers"" in South and Central America where migrants are granted interviews and their cases begin to be taken up. They would be considered for lawful entry to ""participating nations"" like Canada and Spain, in addition to the U.S. It’s part of an overall shift among figures in the Democratic Party that’s seen top mainstream liberals concede the need to overhaul the U.S. immigration system.

George Santos, R-N.Y., after empathizing with voter concerns about the border . Both parties funneled millions of dollars into the race, but Suozzi delivered the critical victory for his party – and shrunk the House GOP majority – by running a campaign that largely shunned progressive ideals. ""Their candidate ran like a Republican. He sounded like a Republican talking about the border and immigration because everybody knows that's the top issue,"" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said of Suozzi during a Wednesday press conference.

FIRST ON FOX: Ohio U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno took aim at President Biden on Friday for his planned visit to East Palestine, Ohio, insisting his trip to the region is ""far overdue"" after a hazardous train derailment last year sent the community's residents into peril. ""Joe Biden's visit to East Palestine is far overdue. While this administration and Democrats in the Senate have been focused on giving endless aid to Ukraine while neglecting our own nation, citizens of East Palestine have paid the price,"" Moreno told Fox News Digital. ""I hope that Biden's visit will inspire him to confront challenges that Americans are dealing with every day rather than continuing to fund endless wars abroad,"" he added. Biden's visit, which was announced last month by the White House, comes more than a year after the train derailment shook the rural Ohio village , which is located in Columbiana County on the state's border with Pennsylvania.

She told reporters, ""The president will visit when it's most helpful to the community."" East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway told Fox last month that he believed the ""best time"" for Biden to travel to the village ""would be February of 2025, when he is on his book tour."" Conaway additionally told Fox, ""The president is always welcome to our town,"" adding, ""that being said, I don’t know what he would do here now."" Biden had claimed in September that he simply had not had time with his busy schedule to visit the Ohio town. Biden's lack of a visit came in contrast to former President Trump , who met with residents of East Palestine on Feb. 22, 2023, just weeks after the incident. Joining him was Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.

Bernie is Strong on the Border, Crime, Cutting Taxes, Election Integrity, the Military / Vets, and will always protect our under siege 2nd Amendment.""

Bernie Moreno is acknowledged at a rally with former President Trump at the Delaware County Fairgrounds on April 23, 2022, in Delaware, Ohio. (AP Photo/Joe Maiorana, File) In a second post, Trump went on to say, ""Bernie Moreno, a highly respected businessman from the GREAT State of Ohio, is exactly the type of MAGA fighter that we need in the United States Senate. Bernie will always stand up to the Fascist ‘nut jobs’ and the spineless RINOS in order to fight the corrupt Deep State that is destroying our Country."" ""Remember, we need a successful political outsider like Bernie to defeat Liberal career politician, Sherrod Brown, who has so poorly represented Ohio, and pretends that he’s all for the Policies of your Favorite President, Donald J. Trump, but then gets to the Senate and votes 100% for the horrendous Policies of Crooked Joe Biden, the worst President in the History of our Country,"" Trump added.

President Biden called for House Republicans to drop their impeachment inquiry against him, saying on Friday that it has been ""an outrageous effort from the beginning."" The president’s comments came after the indictment of FBI informant who alleged that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden had been paid millions of dollars in exchange for their help firing the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings. ""He is lying, and it should be dropped,"" Biden said after a reporter asked about the indicted FBI informant. House Republicans told Fox News Digital that their impeachment inquiry has much more evidence that does not rely on the indicted FBI source. FBI INFORMANT CHARGED WITH GIVING FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN IN 2020 Special Counsel David Weiss charged Alexander Smirnov, 43, with making a false statement and creating a false and fictitious record during FBI interviews. According to the indictment, Smirnov gave ""false derogatory information"" to the FBI despite ""repeated admonishments that he must provide truthful information and that he must not fabricate evidence."" The indictment says that Smirnov had told an FBI agent in March 2017 that he had had a phone call with Burisma’s owner concerning the firm potentially acquiring a U.S. company and making an initial public offering (IPO) on a U.S.-based stock exchange. In reporting this conversation to the FBI agent, Smirnov said that Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma, though that was publicly known. In June 2020, Smirnov is accused of having told the FBI, for the first time, about two meetings he had had four to five years earlier, in which executives associated with Burisma had supposedly admitted that they had hired Hunter Biden to ""protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."" President Joe Biden at the White House on December 13, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) During this meeting, the indictment alleges that Smirnov said the executives had paid $5 million to each of the Bidens while Joe Biden was still in office. The indictment alleges that Smirnov falsely claimed that the Bidens had been paid so that Hunter Biden, with his dad’s help, could take care of a criminal investigation being conducted by the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General, Viktor Shokin, into Burisma. BIDEN, NOT SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR, BROUGHT UP SON'S DEATH IN QUESTIONING The allegations were recorded on an FBI FD-1023 form, which is used by FBI agents to record unverified reporting from confidential human sources. The form is used to document information as told to an FBI agent, but recording that information does not validate or weigh it against other information known by the FBI. The FD-1023 form containing the allegations last year became a key document in the House investigation into the Biden family’s business dealings. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley were approached by a whistleblower last summer who alleged that the FBI was in possession of a document — an FD-1023 form, dated June 30, 2020 — that explicitly detailed information provided by a confidential human source alleging that Biden, while serving as vice president, had been involved in a multi-million-dollar scheme with a foreign national in exchange for influence over policy decisions.

""He is lying, and it should be dropped,"" Biden said, referring to Smirnov’s allegations and the impeachment inquiry. ""It’s just been a — it's been an outrageous effort from the beginning."" Hunter Biden’s attorney Abbe Lowell, earlier Friday, said the same: ""For months we have warned that Republicans have built their conspiracies about Hunter and his family on lies told by people with political agendas, not facts. We were right, and the air is out of their balloon,"" Lowell said in a statement. ""This is just another instance of Chairmen Comer and Jordan peddling falsehoods based on dishonest, uncredible allegations and witnesses.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle on Capitol Hill agreed that Big Tech CEOs have not enough to safeguard children on social media following Senate hearing. Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., reintroduced the Kids Online Safety Act with more than half of the Senate's backing, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, suggesting that the bill will be filibuster-proof when it comes to the floor. On Thursday, Blackburn and Blumenthal announced that the revised bill had 62 senators on board, split evenly between both parties. If passed, it would be one of the largest Big Tech crackdowns in recent years, restricting content for minors that promotes substance abuse, the promotion of suicide, sexual exploitation and alcohol abuse. It would also mandate social media companies to implement certain controls to limit screen time, ban restrictive features and limit access to potentially harmful user profiles.

It also addresses conerns raised by groups who opposed the legislation when it was first rolled out last year due to what they believed would be harmful to LGBTQ+ children. GLAAD, a nonprofit LGBTQ+ advocacy group, and the Human Rights Campaign both rescinded their previous opposition to the bill. ""The recent watershed hearing with Big Tech CEOs showcased the urgent need for reform. With new changes to strengthen the bill and growing support, we should seize this moment to take action. We must listen to the kids, parents, experts, and advocates, and finally hold Big Tech accountable by passing the Kids Online Safety Act into law,"" lawmakers said.

Ronny Jackson reiterated his calls for President Biden to prove his mental fitness for office after it was put into question by Special Counsel Robert Hur. FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans are appealing directly to President Biden demanding that he take a cognitive test to prove his mental fitness for office. Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, the former White House physician who served as chief medical adviser to former President Trump, led a letter to the president co-signed by 83 House Republicans, including House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler, arguing that the president's many public ""gaffes"" are a "" national security concern. "" ""Following the recent report from Special Counsel Robert Hur, we write to express our grave concerns with your current cognitive state and ability to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, including as Chief Executive, Head of State, and Commander in Chief,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""The President of the United States must demonstrate sound mental abilities, regardless of gender, age, or political party, which you have not."" BIDEN BLISTERED BY MAINSTREAM MEDIA AFTER ‘DISASTER’ PRESS CONFERENCE Texas GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician, left, is again calling on President Biden to take a cognitive exam. (Getty Images) It comes as Biden’s critics continue to seize on a recent report by special counsel Robert Hur regarding the president’s handling of classified documents before he took office. Hur’s 388-page report cleared President Biden of wrongdoing despite having ""willfully retained and disclosed classified materials."" Hur said Biden came off ""as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"" and that ""it would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him-by then a former president well into his eighties-of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness."" Biden and his allies have aggressively pushed back on Hur's assessment and denied his age being an issue. BIDEN LASHES OUT AT REPORTERS ASKING ABOUT AGE CONCERNS AFTER SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT The GOP lawmakers wrote to him, ""If you are too mentally impaired to stand trial, as your own Department of Justice claims, then we are concerned that your mental state is not at a competent level to serve as the leader of the free world. Therefore, we call on you to submit to a clinically validated cognitive screening assessment and make those results available to the public."" This is the fifth such request by Jackson. He said his previous four inquiries went unanswered. ""This is the fifth time we’ve sent a letter to the White House demanding Biden take a cognitive exam, however while the administration has chosen to ignore each of these requests, it is becoming clearer each day that the President is not cognitively fit,"" Jackson told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""I am proud to be joined by Conference Chairwoman Stefanik, Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler and dozens of my House colleagues in this effort."" Special counsel Robert Hur cast doubt on President Biden's memory in his 388-page report on the president's handling of classified documents. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The GOP lawmakers' letter continued, ""Over the past three years, your mental decline and forgetfulness has become even more apparent. It is a common occurrence to see you shuffling your feet, stumbling while walking, slurring your words, forgetting names, losing your train of thought, and appearing confused or asleep when making public appearances here at home and on the world stage."" They pointed out that Biden recently confused French President Emmanuel Macron with a predecessor who died decades prior, and that he also mixed up German leaders’ names and mistakenly referred to the president of Egypt as the president of Mexico. SPECIAL COUNSEL CALLS BIDEN 'SYMPATHETIC, WELL-MEANING, ELDERLY MAN WITH A POOR MEMORY,' BRINGS NO CHARGES ""While the prevalence of your ‘gaffes’ continues to increase and creates a serious national security concern, President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party continue to modernize their military at an alarming rate while showing a clear indication of an intent to invade Taiwan in the near future,"" the letter said. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Biden would not be taking a cognitive test in his upcoming physical exam. (JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) ""Unfortunately, we fear that your perceived cognitive deterioration is inviting Beijing to take this military action, as there is significant doubt surrounding your ability to execute the duties required of the President of the United States and prevent further global conflicts from arising or escalating.""

The White House sent another image of ""Dr. Nick"" when reached by Fox News Digital on Friday morning. Earlier this week, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Biden would not be taking a cognitive test as part of his regular physical exam.

EXCLUSIVE: Republican senators are urging the Biden administration to immediately reverse what they call a ""racist"" and ""anti-American"" policy for distributing CHIPS Act grants before it violates the law. The top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, Ranking Member Ted Cruz, R-Texas , and members Sens. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo, penned a letter exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo about the agency’s guidance stating it would consider the race of an applicant’s suppliers when awarding CHIPS Act funding. The senators say that policy is a clear violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution , Title VI, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The guidance requires applicants to document ""how the applicant intends to address the inclusion of … minority-owned business … through a supplier diversity plan"" with ""measurable targets,"" including how much money it plans to spend on ""minority-owned"" suppliers by 2030.

Willis was notably agitated and at points raised her voice during a raucous several hours of testimony. At one point, Willis held up a printed copy the allegations against her in both hands and turned to the judge yelling, ""it is a lie!"" Willis also called defense attorney Ashleigh Merchan's interests ""contrary to democracy."" Judge Scott McAfee presiding over the proceeding, called for a five-minute recess at one point. When court was back in session he told lawyers to stop ""talking over each other"" and cautioned Willis, saying: ""We have to listen to the questions as asked. And if this happens again and again, I'm going to have no choice but to strike your testimony."" Willis is expected back on the stand Friday for further testimony. Trump had his own courtroom drama Thursday. He appeared in a Manhattan court for a pretrial hearing in the criminal ""hush-money"" case against him, where the judge set a date for the beginning of the first trial on criminal charges. The trial is set to start March 25, a few weeks after Super Tuesday but before the end of the GOP primary. Trump said he would be campaigning in the evening after attending the trial. ""I'll be here during the day and I'll be campaigning during the night. Biden should be doing the same thing but he’ll be sleeping,"" Trump said outside the courtroom.

(Candice Ward/Getty Images) On the eve of Valentine's Day and Ash Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was impeached in a historic vote over his mishandling of the illegal immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. T hree Republican lawmakers, Reps. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., Ken Buck, R-Colo., and Tom McClintock, R-Calif., jumped the aisle to vote against the impeachment. The 214-213 vote came after the first impeachment failed earlier this month. Every House Democrat showed up to protect the cabinet secretary, including Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who temporarily left the hospital where he was recovering from surgery to cast his vote. Once Rep. Steve Scalise returned to D.C. from a cancer treatment, the GOP had the numbers to advance the articles of impeachment. House Republicans have accused Mayorkas of violating his oath to defend the U.S. by failing to secure the border and ""refusing"" to enforce immigration laws. The three Republicans who voted against impeachment on Tuesday have criticized Mayorkas' handling of the border but expressed reservations over whether it rose to the level of impeachment. McClintock warned it could set a precedent for political impeachments that could harm Republican officials in the future. This is the first time a Cabinet secretary has been impeached by the U.S. Congress since 1876. It's now up to the Senate — where Democrats run the show — to hold an impeachment trial. Reps.

George Santos’ seat. If the second attempt to impeach the Homeland Security chief had taken place a short time later, the Republicans would have failed again. Instead, they managed to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas–the first sitting Cabinet secretary to draw that sanction–by a single vote. But after a victory in George Santos’ old district, the Democrats would have had the extra vote to stop the impeachment. TRUMP’S NATO COMMENTS TRIGGER FIERCE MEDIA AND EUROPEAN OPPOSITION: HOW SERIOUS IS HE? Tom Suozzi beat Republican Mazi Pilip in Tuesday’s special election on Long Island, unleashing a tidal wave of punditry about his winning formula–openly tackling such issues as illegal migration and crime rather than avoiding them. I always caution against drawing sweeping conclusions in one-off local races, and this election in a snowstorm is no exception. Former U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi, Democratic candidate for New York's 3rd congressional district, speaks at his election night party Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2024, in Woodbury, N.Y. (AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah) The underlying factor was Santos, the outlandish, lying, fabricating lawmaker who won the seat with a made-up resume, was expelled by the House and is under indictment. Voters felt hosed by the Republican publicity hound, and maybe the Dems were more motivated to vote. Sure, Suozzi deserves credit for seizing on illegal migration and crime rather than avoiding such explosive issues – and doggedly distancing himself from President Biden. But he also has to run again in the fall. NATO CHIEF SAYS TRUMP CRITICISM 'DOES UNDERMINE THE SECURITY OF ALL OF US' Trump, for his part, blamed Pilip, ""running in a race where she didn’t endorse me and tried to ‘straddle the fence,’ when she would have easily WON if she understood anything about MODERN DAY politics in America…I STAYED OUT OF THE RACE, ‘I WANT TO BE LOVED!’"" A subtle Valentine’s Day message?

(Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)) The move against Mayorkas, the first against a Cabinet officer in 150 years, is about the politics of symbolism. Republicans know full well the Democratic-controlled Senate is not going to convict him. This was about keeping the spotlight on one of the GOP’s best issues . But if the press saddled Johnson with a humiliating defeat last week, it has to credit him with a big win now. Both episodes shed light on the fractious politics of the Hill. Just when it looked like the Senate might pass a bipartisan border security bill–which included military aid to Ukraine and Israel–Donald Trump ripped it and the package was dead. YOU DON'T NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM TO SECURE THE BORDER: MARC THIESSEN Now the Senate appears ready to pass a stand-alone military aid bill by a filibuster-proof majority. But Johnson says he won’t bring it up for a House floor vote. That would bury it, unless a handful of Republicans join with Democrats to force a vote through a discharge petition. Think about it: the United States, unable to help two major allies because of election-year politics, especially Ukraine, which remains under siege by Vladimir Putin. And that’s why Biden took the rare step of delivering a televised speech on Tuesday. His predecessor gave him an opening by saying he wouldn’t protect any NATO member who didn’t pay its fair share in military costs. And if that were the case, Putin and Russia could ""do whatever the hell they want."" WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 13: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks on the Senate's recent passage of the National Security Supplemental Bill, which provides military aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 13, 2024, in Washington, DC. During his remarks Biden urged House Republicans and U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) to move the legislation through the House of Representatives. (Anna Moneymaker) Biden, in his speech , accused Trump of siding with the Russian dictator, calling the comments ""dumb,"" ""shameful,"" ""dangerous"" and ""un-American."" Put aside whether Biden is right or Trump is trying to pressure delinquent allies. Joe Biden passed up a softball Super Bowl interview. So why is he getting in front of the cameras now? One, he’s trying to get push Congress to pass the military aid bill. Two, he’s trying to change the subject from his own questionable memory in that wake of that stinging special counsel’s report. Three, he is finally heeding the advice of those who say he needs to do more television to prove his competence and dim the focus on every gaffe or misstatement. What’s fascinating is the spin of each party when it comes to backing their candidate. Democrats are hitting the airwaves saying Biden is sharp and laser-focused in private, and counsel Robert Hur has no business airing his personal criticism of the president’s mental acuity.

Donald Trump has made some news that is reverberating around the world. It wasn’t him saying – after that incredible Super Bowl comeback by Kansas City – that he signed a law boosting earnings for musicians so Taylor Swift shouldn’t endorse Joe Biden (also ""I like her boyfriend, Travis""). It wasn’t ""we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country, we will rout the Fake News Media, we will Drain the Swamp."" It’s not that he told a South Carolina rally that "" Biden's thugs are still trying to put me in jail on fake charges for crimes that they openly admit that Crooked Joe did. He actually did these crimes"" – while adding ""I’m not looking for anything to happen to this guy."" WHY BIDEN’S ANGER AND DEFENSIVENESS INFLAMED ANXIETY ABOUT HIS MEMORY ISSUES No, it’s about NATO. Trump recalled a conversation with the president ""of a big country,"" who he says asked him if they didn’t increase their defense contribution to the North Atlantic alliance ""and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?"" Sharing his response at the rally, Trump claims he said: ""You didn’t pay. You’re delinquent… No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want."" The idea that Vladimir Putin could do ""whatever the hell they want"" set off alarm bells, not only among foreign policy officials in Europe but in much of the mainstream media here at home. One potential impact would be on Ukraine, with Trump having declined to endorse more military aid to that weakened country, which would allow Russia’s unprovoked invasion to succeed in either keeping its territorial gains along the eastern border or capturing the entire sovereign nation. And yet there is further evidence, as if any were needed, that the GOP is now Trump’s party. Some of the biggest Republican hawks, who staunchly supported NATO in the past, say they have no problem with the former president’s remarks.

Tom Cotton, another leading hawk, said in 2016 that America must ""make sure that we stand by NATO and we stand for countries like Ukraine and Georgia"" who face ""Russian aggression, and recognize Vladimir Putin as the adversary he is."" On Sunday, the senator said NATO countries not paying their full share are ""already encouraging Russian aggression, and President Trump is simply ringing the warning bell."" UKRAINE AID PACKAGE WOULD BE USED TO IMPEACH TRUMP, SEN VANCE WARNS Marco Rubio said in 2018 that Trump went too far by ""questioning the value of the alliance,"" tweeting: ""The end of #NATO would be a dream come true for #Putin."" On Sunday, the senator said he had ""zero"" concerns about Trump’s latest comments and suggested he didn’t mean them: ""We’ve already been through this. ""You would think people would’ve figured it out by now."" And here’s the kicker: Rubio and Graham pushed through a bill barring any president from withdrawing from NATO. I wonder who they might have had in mind?

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Look, I get it. This is how Trump negotiates. During his first term he regularly questioned the value of the NATO alliance as a way of getting some country to keep their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, with some success. It’s an approach he honed as a businessman when he would threaten to walk away from a deal unless certain conditions were met. But when Trump took office with little experience in foreign policy, he was talked out of any withdrawal by such retired generals as Jim Mattis and John Kelly. The New York Times reports this anecdote: ""Soon after former President Donald J. Trump took office, his staff explained how NATO’s mutual defense obligations worked. ""‘You mean, if Russia attacked Lithuania, we would go to war with Russia?’ he responded. ‘That’s crazy.’ Mr. Trump has never believed in the fundamental one-for-all-and-all-for-one concept of the Atlantic alliance."" But Trump has made clear that in a second term he would surround himself with loyalists who would not attempt to stop such decisions. Senior adviser Jason Miller says Biden has reversed Trump’s approach to NATO: ""Democrat and media pearl-clutchers seem to have forgotten that we had four years of peace and prosperity under President Trump, but Europe saw death and destruction under Obama-Biden and now more death and destruction under Biden."" FINLAND CENTER-RIGHT CANDIDATE ALEXANDER STUBB DECLARES PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY WITH NEARLY 52% OF VOTE Much of the media are leading the charge on NATO. CNN’s Christiane Amanpour called Trump’s latest comments ""insane."" It’s also true that top European officials are being quoted on the record as criticizing Trump’s language. They would be irresponsible if they didn’t start plotting a Plan B. European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 28, 2022. (REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo) The crux of the argument is that the alliance created in the wake of World War II has worked well in deterring war and doesn’t need to be fixed. I happen to be in that camp – and the only time the mutual defense pact has been invoked was when our allies aided us after the Sept. 11 attacks.
