cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/ukraine-aid-oversight-watchdog/index.html,"CNN — More than 400 personnel take part in the oversight of Ukraine aid, according to a new report from a US government watchdog, underscoring the massive effort to manage billions of dollars in US assistance. Congress has appropriated $113.4 billion in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , which has provided security, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other countries affected by the war. The money also supports an enlarged US military presence in Europe and the training of the Ukrainian military. To oversee the interagency effort, the inspectors general from the Defense Department, State Department, and United States Agency for International Development work with 20 other federal agencies and the Ukrainian government. In total, the report said there are more than 400 personnel working across the US, Germany, Ukraine and Europe to audit and evaluate US assistance to Ukraine. The report comes as some Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have demanded more oversight over Ukraine aid before they agree to any additional funding. Earlier this week, the Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid package that includes assistance to Ukraine, but the bill faces an uncertain future in the US House of Representatives, where Johnson has signaled he will not bring it for a vote. Johnson met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in December, saying afterwards that the Biden administration wanted “billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight.” The lengths to which the US has gone to provide that oversight is detailed in the first quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve (OAR), the name for the mission to bolster NATO and support Ukraine. The mission was first launched in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea, but it grew significantly following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Defense Department Office of the Inspector General alone has more than 200 staff members working on Ukraine oversight. Of those, 28 are in Europe, including two in Kyiv, with plans for more, the report said. The State Department watchdog has more than 100 staff members working on Ukraine oversight, three of whom are in Kyiv. The USAID watchdog has another 80 personnel working on Ukraine. In addition, law enforcement personnel from the different agencies work with Ukrainian authorities to investigate misconduct that could threaten US aid to Ukraine. The watchdogs have also set up the Ukraine Fraud and Corruption Investigative Working Group to root out and prevent corrupt dealings of US aid to Ukraine. Since the beginning of the war, these agencies have opened 57 investigations and closed 14 of them, resulting in two convictions, according to the report. In one case, investigators found that since November 2021 – three months before Russia invaded Ukraine – seven US soldiers and civilian contractors stole seven tons of fuel worth $2 million from a base in Romania used to assist Ukraine. As the war nears the two year mark, the report also details Russia’s growing reliance on foreign aid to fuel its war effort. Since the US warned a deal was possible last summer, North Korea has likely provided Russia with “millions of artillery rounds and other weapons” and may be preparing to provide other weapons as well. Iran has provided more than 1,000 one-way attack drones and multi-use drones to Russia, as well as other military equipment to use against Ukraine. Iran has also likely considered providing Russia with ballistic missiles, which CNN reported last month was a possibility."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/former-fbi-informant-charged-biden-burisma/index.html,"CNN — Special counsel David Weiss charged a former FBI informant with lying about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s involvement in business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, undercutting a major aspect of Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into the president. Alexander Smirnov, 43, is facing charges in connection with lying to the FBI and creating false records. He was arrested Thursday at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, after his arrival in the US from overseas, and will make his initial appearance in federal court Thursday afternoon. CNN is working to determine whether Smirnov has an attorney. The indictment alleges that Smirnov’s story to the FBI “was a fabrication, an amalgam of otherwise unremarkable business meetings and contacts that had actually occurred but at a later date than he claimed and for the purpose of pitching Burisma on the Defendant’s services and products, not for discussing bribes to [Joe Biden] when he was in office.” Congressional Republicans have championed Smirnov’s now-discredited allegations for roughly a year, though not by name. They fought with the FBI to obtain memos about what Smirnov told investigators and publicly released the materials over the FBI’s objections. The congressional Republicans repeatedly praised Smirnov as “credible” and put his uncorroborated claims front-and-center in their impeachment inquiry into the president. While announcing the impeachment inquiry, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said “a trusted FBI informant has alleged a bribe to the Biden family.” The FBI is now using some of the same memos that congressional Republicans released as part of their indictment against Smirnov. “For months we have warned that Republicans have built their conspiracies about Hunter and his family on lies told by people with political agendas, not facts,” said Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden’s lawyer, in a statement to CNN. “We were right and the air is out of their balloon. This is just another instance of Chairmen Comer and Jordan peddling falsehoods based on dishonest, uncredible allegations and witnesses,” he added. House Oversight Chair James Comer said in a Thursday statement to CNN that his investigation into the president does not revolve around Smirnov or his claims made in the FD-1023 – a form the FBI uses to memorialize information gathered from confidential sources – that Republican legislators have cited. “To be clear, the impeachment inquiry is not reliant on the FBI’s FD-1023. It is based on a large record of evidence, including bank records and witness testimony, revealing that Joe Biden knew of and participated in his family’s business dealings,” the Kentucky Republican said. He said the FBI had previously defended Smirnov’s credibility. “When asked by the committee about their confidence in the confidential human source, the FBI told the committee the confidential human source was credible and trusted, had worked with the FBI for over a decade, and had been paid six figures,” Comer added. According to court records, Smirnov told an FBI agent that he had spoken with the owner of Burisma about the company’s efforts to buy a company in the United States. As part of his report to the FBI, the indictment alleges, Smirnov also noted that someone referred to as “Businessperson 1” was on the board of Burisma and was also the son of an individual referred to as “Public Official 1.” Though the indictment does not identify these individuals, sources identified “Public Official 1” as Joe Biden and “Businessperson 1” as Hunter Biden. During Joe Biden’s campaign for presidency, Smirnov allegedly submitted reports to the FBI about two meetings with Burisma executives from 2015 and 2016, during which the executives admitted that they hired Hunter Biden to “protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems.” Smirnov also allegedly reported that executives paid $5 million each to Joe and Hunter Biden while Joe Biden was vice president so that Hunter would “take care of all those issues through his dad,” referring to a criminal investigation being conducted by the then-Ukrainian prosecutor general into Burisma. “In truth and fact, the Defendant had contact with executives from Burisma in 2017, after the end of the Obama-Biden Administration and after the then Ukrainian Prosecutor General had been fired in February 2016, in other words, when [Joe Biden] had no ability to influence U.S. policy and when the Prosecutor General was no longer in office,” the indictment states. It continues, “In short, the Defendant transformed his routine and unextraordinary business contacts with Burisma in 2017 and later into bribery allegations against [Joe Biden], the presumptive nominee of one of the two major political parties for President, after expressing bias against [Joe Biden] and his candidacy.” This story has been updated with additional details.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/new-york-trump-hearing/index.html,"New York CNN — A date for Donald Trump’s first criminal trial has been set in the former president’s New York criminal hush money case . With Trump in attendance at the hearing in downtown Manhattan, New York state Judge Juan Merchan confirmed that the former president’s trial will begin on March 25, as originally scheduled, on charges that Trump falsified business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign. The decision helps solidify the former president’s legal calendar that is filling up at the same time that his 2024 campaign is closing in on the Republican nomination for president. The date of the New York trial had been in limbo in part because Trump’s federal trial in Washington, DC, on election subversion charges had initially been scheduled for March, too, but that is now on hold while Trump is attempting have the charges dismissed on claims of presidential immunity. He has asked the Supreme Court to step in, which could further delay the federal trial. That would likely make the New York hush money case the first of Trump’s election-year trials. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was the first to charge Trump last year, accusing him in a 34-count indictment of falsifying business records as part of a cover up to conceal hush money payments before the 2016 election to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had an affair with Trump. Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty. Here’s what to know heading into Thursday’s hearing: Trump sought to dismiss the case or various charges Merchan on Thursday rejected Trump’s long-shot motion to dismiss the entire case. Arguments that will likely be at the crux of the former president’s trial defense may also be ruled on. Trump and his lawyers have accused Bragg of resurrecting a “zombie” case six years too late to serve a political agenda to interfere with Trump’s 2024 presidential bid. Bragg has also endured negative speculation from critics who argue the case is thin and question whether it passes legal muster. Prosecutors allege Trump conspired with his former personal attorney Michael Cohen in a scheme to buy Daniels’ silence ahead of the 2016 election and falsified business records to hide reimbursements checks to Cohen who facilitated the $130,00 payment to Daniels. They allege Trump was aware of falsified invoices, reimbursement checks to Cohen and how those reimbursements were recorded in an attempt to commit or conceal several crimes, including election law, tax laws and the falsification of other business records. Trump’s lawyers have said he paid Cohen through his personal accounts — not involving business records. If he doesn’t toss the entire case, Trump lawyers have said Merchan should at least dismiss charges they argue are multiplicitous, because he currently faces more than one count for each of the 11 reimbursement payments to Cohen. The parties may also argue Thursday over who Trump can call in his defense case at trial, including campaign finance experts. Trump’s attorneys have also asked Merchan to consider holding a hearing over alleged grand jury leaks — the typically secretive judicial process was widely reported in national news ahead of the indictment. They also want the judge to compel more specific information from prosecutors about their evidence relating to Trump’s alleged intent to defraud. Trump’s lawyers have said the grand jury didn’t hear evidence that the former president knew about the scheme or intended to defraud anyone. Prosecutors told the judge the six-year delay was “justified” since there was an ongoing related federal investigation and Trump fought a subpoena for his records, which landed the case before the US Supreme Court. How we got here: The years-long investigation into Trump The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office officially launched its investigation into the alleged hush-money schemes under the previous DA, Cy Vance, in August 2018, the same day Cohen pleaded guilty to charges related to the Daniels payments across the street in a Manhattan federal courtroom. Under Vance, prosecutors shifted their investigation to focus on the Trump Organization’s finances and away from the repayment scheme. Bragg, who took office in January 2022, has accused Trump of leaning on his political power to avoid criminal responsibility for years and campaigned on a promise to prosecute the former president.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images In pictures: Trump in court for hush money case Prev Next A grand jury was eventually green-lit to hear the hush money case in December 2022, days before a jury in another state criminal trial convicted the Trump Organization on 17 counts related to tax fraud that slapped Trump’s company with $1.6 million in fines. The grand jury empaneled on January 23, 2023, ultimately returned the 34-count indictment in this case on March 30. If convicted on the 34 identical counts of falsifying business records, which are a class E felony, Trump could face up to 4 years in prison. But as a first-time offender, he would unlikely be sentenced to prison time. It would make him a convicted felon regardless of his sentence. As the conviction would be on state charges, Trump would not be able to pardon himself if reelected president. Trump’s first trial will begin next month as the primaries continue Merchan set the initial March 25 trial date last year, but he said they could “make any necessary” changes if there are any “actual conflicts” – a nod to the federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith. Indeed, district Judge Tanya Chutkan initially set a March 4 trial date for Trump’s federal election subversion trial in Washington, DC, which would have likely pushed back the New York trial. Now that trial is on hold while Trump’s immunity claims play out. Complicating the schedule further is the uncertainty of time for Trump’s appeal: The Supreme Court could decline to hear the case, putting the trial back in Chutkan’s hands to begin relatively quickly. But if the high court does take up Trump’s appeal, that trial is likely on hold for weeks, if not months, while the presidential immunity issue is decided. The New York case in many ways fell into the background last year following Trump’s arraignment last spring. Smith brought charges against Trump for his alleged mishandling of classified documents last June and again for alleged election subversion in August, and then Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis charged Trump later that month in a sprawling racketeering case involving Trump and 18 co-defendants. But now the New York trial is primed to be the first where a jury will decide Trump’s guilt or innocence. Now that the March 25 date remains in effect, it will take place as Trump is collecting delegates in presidential primaries for the Republican nomination and preparing for a potential general election rematch against President Joe Biden. It’s not clear yet whether Trump would be required to attend every day of the trial or if he can ask not to appear. His attendance for Thursday’s hearing was waived but he chose to attend, rather than going to Georgia to watch a hearing seeking to disqualify Willis from his Georgia case. Trump is only an observer at this hearing Trump on Thursday is sitting in his fourth different courtroom this year, including three for separate cases in New York. He attended closing arguments last month in his New York civil fraud trial before Judge Arthur Engoron – in which the judge is expected to rule on Friday – as well as testified and attended multiple days at the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, where a jury found Trump liable for $83.3 million in damages. Trump also sat in for oral arguments at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on his immunity claims in January, though he did not speak or have a role in that hearing. In both prior New York cases, Trump found ways to make his presence felt in the courtroom, both on the witness stand and from the defendant’s table. In the defamation case, district Judge Lewis Kaplan restricted what Trump could testify to before the jury, and at one point he warned Trump that he could be removed from the courtroom if he kept up his audible commentary during Carroll’s testimony. And in the New York civil trial, Trump’s time on the witness stand in November was a spectacle, where the former president used the opportunity to bash the trial and the charges brought by the New York attorney general. During closing arguments last month, Engoron told Trump’s lawyer he could not speak as part of the defense case – but Trump found a way to deliver a five-minute monologue, anyway. Speaking to reporters ahead of his appearance, Trump — who has similarly used other court proceedings to generate publicity for his campaign — said the case against him is politically motivated and amounts to “election interference.” “This is just a way of hurting me in the election because I’m leading by a lot,” Trump said."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/jared-kushner-trump-second-term/index.html,"CNN — Donald Trump ’s son-in-law Jared Kushner said Tuesday he does not plan on serving in a second Trump administration as he is committed to focusing on his business ventures. “Nothing in my life has gone according to the plans I’ve set, and that’s been the only consistent thing,” Kushner said at an Axios event in Miami, before emphasizing that he’s been “very clear” in his desire to focus on his private equity firm “at this phase” in his life. Kushner served as a senior adviser in his father-in-law’s administration. He transitioned to the financial sector after leaving the White House, starting a Miami-based investment firm called Affinity Partners Kushner said Tuesday that he’s enjoyed having his family “out of the spotlight” after he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, saw their White House roles end after her father left office. He also said that he was “right now” committed to “my investors, to my firm, to my employees, to my partners, and that’s what I’m planning to do.” Pressed on whether he would turn down an administration job from his father-in-law if asked directly, Kushner answered “yes.” He said Trump has had “time to really reflect” on his third presidential campaign .

Scott Olson/Getty Images Related article A more disciplined Trump operation faces fresh headaches from outside allies and the candidate himself “I think that the team around him is maybe the best he’s had,” Kushner said, predicting that if Trump is elected again, he would have a “level of competence and professionalism” in his White House that would be “even more so than it was in the last administration.” Kushner said Trump’s first White House bid was a “family campaign,” in which he was an “outsider running.” But this time, he would be able “to build a really incredible team based on the people who are available.” Later, Kushner again brushed off concerns about personnel in the Trump White House, saying that people who shouldn’t have been there initially were “weeded out” and that despite the chaos surrounding some individuals, “underneath the waves … water was calm.” Kushner’s 2022 memoir provided insight into the pernicious environment inside the Trump West Wing, revealing how viciously members of his father-in-law’s team turned on one another from the earliest days of the administration, and how distrust and resentment affected every aspect of governing. During Trump’s White House tenure, Kushner’s fingerprints were on many, if not all , of the administration’s agenda items – from the border wall and immigration to relations with China, criminal justice, trade agreements between Mexico and Canada and the United States, the Middle East and, ultimately, the White House’s coronavirus response. Kushner also headed up the White House Office of American Innovation, whose goal was to modernize government technology. Prior to working in the White House, Kushner had no political experience. He served as CEO of his family’s real estate development firm, Kushner Properties. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Kate Bennett contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/new-york-redistricting-house-map/index.html,"CNN — A bipartisan redistricting commission in New York approved a new congressional map Thursday that could help Empire State Democrats make slight gains in this year’s US House elections but falls well short of an electoral windfall for the party. New York is expected to be an epicenter in the battle for the House this fall, with Republicans’ narrow majority on the line. The GOP flipped four seats in the state in the 2022 midterms, gains that helped the party win control of the chamber. The new map, approved 9-1 by the New York State Independent Redistricting Commission, now moves for final action to the Democratic-controlled state legislature, where its fate is unclear. Several Democrats on Thursday said they were still examining the commission’s work product and remained noncommittal. “The Senate Majority is eager to review the proposed map,” Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the top Democrat in the state Senate, said in a statement. “We plan to discuss and decide our subsequent actions soon.” Freshman Republican Brandon Williams – who represents parts of central New York – would see the biggest change to his district under the map approved Thursday. His new seat would include more territory favorable to Democrats – likely resulting in a Democratic pickup. But, under the compromise crafted by the commission, two Hudson Valley seats – held by Republican Marc Molinaro and Democrat Pat Ryan – each appear to have grown safer for the incumbents. And, notably, the commission’s map leaves largely undisturbed other House districts in the New York City suburbs, which have been viewed as potential battlegrounds in November. The US Capitol is seen at sunrise in Washington, DC, on October 18, 2023. Jose Luis Magana/AP Related article Redistricting fights in these states could determine which party controls the US House Ken Jenkins, the commission’s chairman and a Democrat, described Thursday’s vote as “ultimately a victory for the commission process and for small-d democratic participation in the state of New York.” The disputes over New York’s congressional districts have been closely followed in Washington, where the outcome of redistricting fights across the country could shape which party controls the House after November’s elections. The GOP’s majority in the chamber narrowed further this week when Democrat Tom Suozzi won a special election to succeed expelled former Republican Rep. George Santos in New York’s 3rd Congressional District on Long Island. The new map eased GOP fears that it could have been a major boon for Democrats, and a top New York Republican called on state lawmakers to accept the commission’s approach. “The State Legislature should adopt these district lines without change,” state GOP chairman Ed Cox said in a statement. “The voting public deserves to have continuity in district boundaries and to avoid chaos.” But Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, urged caution, saying the map would require “a thorough examination” by the legislature. If approved by the legislature, the New York map would represent a far more modest outcome than what occurred last fall in North Carolina – where the GOP-controlled legislature passed a heavily gerrymandered map that is poised to ensure Republican dominance in the state’s 14-member congressional delegation. The New York commission’s action on Thursday came after the state’s highest court tasked the panel with drawing a new map – following a protracted legal battle. A state court judge had overseen the process of drawing the map used in the 2022 elections after the redistricting commission had failed to agree on new lines after the 2020 census. Democrats in the state legislature have final say over the map, holding the power to reject the commission’s plan and take over the line-drawing themselves. But that risks triggering another round of legal fights, with Republicans likely to challenge any map they view as an overly aggressive gerrymander. In a statement, Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which supports the GOP’s redistricting efforts, said the commission’s redistricting process “should have never been reopened” and called the panel’s map “a step back.” As part of the compromise approved Thursday, the 16th Congressional District, which includes a slice of New York City and parts of Westchester County, remained virtually unchanged. Two-term Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman is facing a primary challenge from George Latimer, the Westchester County executive who previously served in the New York State Assembly. Edna Courville, here posing for a portrait in Texas City, Texas, on September 23, 2023, is a plaintiff in an ongoing redistricting case in Galveston County. Michael Starghill Jr. Related article Redistricting fights across South put future of Voting Rights Act in the spotlight again Latimer said Thursday he was moving forward with his bid and is confident that the state legislature would complete the process of approving the map. “Regardless of the timing or the ultimate disposition of the lines, we look forward to continuing to bring our message of progressive results that benefit the people of our area, in whatever neighborhood they live and whatever jurisdictions are ultimately assigned to CD-16,” Latimer said in a statement. New York faces a court-ordered deadline of February 28 to complete its redistricting process, but it was unclear Thursday when the state legislature would next meet to consider the map. Time is running short. State lawmakers in New York are scheduled to be on recess next week, and House candidates are slated to begin collecting signatures for petitions to run for office on February 27. That leaves little time for lawmakers to approve – and for Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to sign into law – new district lines. Approving the map would require the support of a two-thirds majority in each chamber, noted Jeffrey Wice, an expert on redistricting and an adjunct professor at New York Law School. And some legislators “don’t know what to make” of the map at the moment. “It’s still not over yet,” Wice said. This story has been updated with additional information."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/takeaways-fani-willis-testimony-georgia/index.html,"CNN — The Georgia election subversion case against Donald Trump and 14 of his allies took a stunning turn Thursday when two top prosecutors testified under oath about their romantic relationship at a hearing triggered by allegations of self-dealing that have the potential to derail the entire effort. The all-day hearing escalated steadily throughout the day, culminating with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis taking the witness stand for a combative brawl with defense attorneys that drew several rebukes from the judge. Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump arrives on stage for a Get Out The Vote rally at the North Charleston Convention Center on February 14, 2024 in North Charleston, South Carolina. Win McNamee/Getty Images Related article Trump’s team facing a new conundrum: How to stay on the trail during a weekslong criminal trial Judge Scott McAfee convened the hearing after some of Trump’s co-defendants surfaced allegations of a relationship between Willis and Nathan Wade, whom she hired in 2021 to join the prosecution team. Trump and his co-defendants want the judge to disqualify Willis’ team from the case – or throw out the charges – because of a possible conflict-of-interest. There was talk of cash exchanging hands from Willis to Wade, where they store their money at home, CashApp usage, and their spending habits – all to get to the question of whether Willis benefitted financially from putting him on her staff. The hearing will continue Friday with Willis still on the stand. The judge said he does not plan to issue a ruling on Friday. Here are takeaways from the hearing that was at times jaw-dropping, awkward and strikingly personal. Willis’ defiant afternoon on the stand What unfolded on Thursday is extremely rare in American courtrooms. The district attorney who has charged Trump with racketeering went under oath to defend her ethics and answer personal questions about her relationship with Wade. The risks could not be greater, and Willis’ credibility is on the line. Things quickly went off the rails. Willis didn’t act much like a traditional witness and was more like a prosecutor, arguing with the defense attorneys, raising objections, making legal arguments and even having exchanges with the judge. She even raised her voice at one point. This led to a few rebukes from McAfee, who urged her and other attorneys in the courtroom to maintain “professionalism” and to not “talk over each other.” Willis repeatedly accused some of the defense attorneys of peddling lies – before and after the judge’s admonishment. “You’ve lied in this. … I think you lied right here,” Willis said to attorney Ashleigh Merchant, pointing to copies of filings that raised accusations of self-dealing and nepotism. ‘I’m not on trial,’ Willis says Willis seized several opportunities to defend herself. The district attorney had fought efforts to make her appear, both in Wade’s ongoing divorce proceedings and in the hearing on Thursday, up until the moment she came into the room to take the stand. She said at the beginning of her testimony that she was “very anxious” to defend herself, “so I ran to the courtroom.” “You think I’m on trial,” Willis said, in her sharpest pushback of the day. “These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020,” she added, pointing toward the table of attorneys representing defendants in the criminal case. “I’m not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.” She later slammed the defense attorneys, calling them “confused” and “intrusive.” “Ms. Merchant’s interests are contrary to democracy, not to mine,” Willis said, attacking the attorney for Trump campaign attorney Michael Roman, who is accused of playing a leading role in the multi-state “fake electors” plot to subvert the Electoral College.

On the stand, Wade stuck to his earlier claim – in a sworn affidavit submitted to the court – that his romantic relationship with Willis began in early 2022 and that they split travel and vacation expenses. But Robin Bryant-Yeartie, a former friend of Willis and Fulton County employee, contradicted that claim, testifying that she had “no doubt” that the Willis-Wade affair began in late 2019. Notably, that would be before Willis hired Wade to lead the Trump probe in late 2021. Bryant-Yeartie said she observed “hugging, kissing, close affection” between Willis and Wade prior to 2022, when they claimed their romantic relationship began. She also testified that Willis had told her in 2020 and 2021 that she was dating Wade. There was some Clinton-esque parsing of words on whether Wade cheated on his ex-wife by being with Willis. Past filings from Roman’s team salaciously noted that she had been dating “a married man.” Wade testified that his previous marriage was broken since 2015, long before his relationship with Willis began, saying, “My marriage was irretrievably broken” in 2015, and “I was free to have a relationship.” Wade and Willis describe using cash for reimbursements Wade and Willis have offered a simple explanation for why there’s essentially no paper trail to back up his claims they split expenses: Willis used cash. Credit card statements submitted in Wade’s divorce proceedings show he paid for two flights for them in recent years, to San Francisco and Miami. They also took lavish trips to Belize, the Bahamas and some Caribbean cruises. When pressed on whether he paid for Willis’ travel when they vacationed together, Wade said that Willis reimbursed him for a flight “in cash.” Wade said he did not have receipts for all of the times Willis reimbursed him for trips – pushing back against the allegations from the defense side that Willis was essentially getting kickbacks from him in the form of vacations. “I did not deposit the cash in my account,” Wade replied, smirking at times. Defense attorney Craig Gillen, who represents one of the fake electors, grilled Wade on what he would do with the cash reimbursements – in at least one case, thousands of dollars. “You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash?” Gillen shot back, raising his voice slightly. “No sir,” Wade said, to which Gillen replied: “Not a single solitary one?” “Not a one,” Wade responded. Willis: ‘I don’t need anybody to foot my bills’ There was also a dispute over when the relationship ended, and whether it had any impact on the decision to seek the massive RICO indictment against Trump and others in last August. Both said the relationship ended in summer 2023. Willis implied that the physical component ended earlier in the summer, but that the two had a “tough conversation” that fully ended things afterward. Trump lawyer Steven Sadow asked Willis about the breakup, eliciting an answer that revealed sexist remarks that Wade allegedly made to Willis in the past. She said, he “is used to women that, as he told me one time, ‘the only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich.’” She explained that this was a part of their breakup – but it also was a defense to the self-dealing claims against her. “We would have brutal arguments about the fact that ‘I am your equal,’” Willis said. “I don’t need anything from a man – a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back.” Willis added, “I don’t need anybody to foot my bills.” Earlier, Sadow asked Wade during his own testimony whether the two had any “personal relationship at all” since their relationship ended, saying “and you know what I mean by that.” Wade shot back, asking if Sadow meant “if I had intercourse with the district attorney.” “We’re very good friends, probably closer than ever because of these attacks,” Wade said. “But if you’re asking me about specific intercourse, the answer is no.” Huge distraction from the charges against Trump – for now Nothing that happened Thursday undercut the factual allegations against Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, or the other GOP allies who are accused of trying to overturn the 2020 election. But the hearing shifted the conversation away from those allegation and away from Trump’s legal woes for now. Earlier in the day, a New York judge set the trial date for Trump’s historic first trial, in the hush-money criminal case, for March 25. But by the afternoon, that news was nearly washed away by the jaw-dropping testimony taking place in Atlanta and being beamed across the country on national television. (Unlike the New York case, cameras are allowed in Georgia courtrooms.) While Willis will return to the stand for cross-examination on Friday, any benefit Trump receives may be short lived. Friday, a separate New York judge is expected to issue his decision in the Trump civil fraud case that’s an existential threat to his business. State prosecutors want that judge to issue a $370 million fine against Trump, after finding that Trump and his company committed significant fraud against banks and insurers by lying about his net worth and assets. They also want Trump barred from doing business in New York.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/navy-federal-congressional-black-caucus/index.html,"CNN — Members of Congress pressed the CEO of the nation’s largest credit union for answers about racial disparities in its mortgage lending during a Capitol Hill meeting Thursday but said they left unsatisfied with her responses. Mary McDuffie, the CEO of Navy Federal Credit Union, met with three members of the Congressional Black Caucus who have demanded answers in the wake of CNN’s reporting on racial disparities in the lender’s mortgage approvals. It’s the latest example of congressional scrutiny for Navy Federal, which has more than 13 million members and lends to military servicemembers, defense personnel, veterans and their families. “We’re trying to achieve the goal of closing the racial wealth gap in America,” said Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, after meeting with McDuffie. “You cannot do that with practices like this that deny equal opportunity to homeownership.” A CNN investigation published in December found that Navy Federal approved more than 75% of the White borrowers who applied for a new conventional home purchase mortgage in 2022 while approving less than 50% of Black borrowers who applied for the same type of loan, according to the most recent federal data available. Photo illustration. Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/Shutterstock Related article The nation’s largest credit union rejected more than half its Black conventional mortgage applicants The nearly 29-percentage-point gap in Navy Federal’s approval rates was the widest of any of the 50 lenders that originated the most mortgage loans in 2022. The disparity remained even after accounting for variables such as applicants’ income, debt-to-income ratio and property value, CNN’s review found. McDuffie met for about an hour Thursday with Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus; Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance; and Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California. McDuffie declined to answer CNN’s questions as she entered and exited the closed-door meeting. Cleaver told CNN after the meeting that McDuffie and other Navy Federal representatives “could not provide an answer” explaining the racial disparities in mortgage approvals, and that he hoped to hear more from them in the future. “We’re expecting to have another meeting with them, we’re expecting to get facts this time,” he said. A Navy Federal spokesperson said in a statement that the credit union is “committed to engaging with policymakers on this important issue” and “we work daily to help expand economic opportunity and access to credit for our diverse community of members.” Reps. Steven Horsford and Emanuel Cleaver speak to reporters after meeting with Navy Federal Credit Union CEO Mary McDuffie on Capitol Hill. CNN In December, days after CNN’s story was published, Navy Federal hired a civil rights lawyer to review its mortgage practices and “make recommendations to drive further access to home ownership.” Horsford said that the members “asked very specific questions about the timeline of that review,” and found the responses from Navy Federal “inadequate.” “Time is of the essence, because every single day that they don’t change or update their protocols is a servicemember, and particularly a Black or Latino servicemember, who is facing denials,” he said. Navy Federal has previously argued that CNN’s analysis is incomplete because it did not include applicants’ credit scores or information about their available cash deposits or relationship history with the lender – none of which is publicly available in the federal data. The credit union declined to provide CNN any additional data that would make it possible to analyze those factors. Navy Federal has also noted that a higher percentage of its mortgage loans go to Black borrowers than most other large lenders. But Horsford said Thursday that that excuse didn’t address “the issue of denials.” “More than 40% of our servicemembers, active duty, are people of color,” he said. “So yeah, they are one of the leading lenders and mortgage lenders for Black home loans – because they have a higher percentage of servicemembers who are their membership. It should be higher.” Several Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee, including Cleaver and ranking member Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, wrote a letter last week asking the committee’s Republican chair to hold a hearing on the racial disparities in Navy Federal’s mortgage lending. And ten Democratic senators have separately asked federal regulators to examine Navy Federal’s mortgage practices, citing both CNN and a separate analysis of public mortgage data by Senate banking committee staff that also found racial disparities in its lending. Navy Federal is also facing a federal class-action lawsuit from mortgage applicants who cite CNN’s reporting and allege that the credit union discriminated against them. A judge approved a motion to consolidate three separate lawsuits against the credit union into a single case last month."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/matt-rosendale-montana-senate/index.html,"CNN — Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale has ended his bid for Senate less than a week after launching his campaign, citing former President Donald Trump ’s endorsement of his Republican primary opponent. “I have long been a supporter of the President, and remain so. But I have been forced to calculate what my chances of success would be with Trump supporting my opponent,” Rosendale said in a statement Thursday. He added that with a lack of resources and the former president’s endorsement “the hill was just too steep.” Just hours after Rosendale announced his run Friday, Trump endorsed retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who has the backing of several high-profile Republicans, in the race to take on vulnerable Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. However, Trump added that he would back Rosendale should he run for reelection to his House seat in Montana’s 2nd Congressional District. The congressman did not say Thursday whether he plans to do so, and a number of prominent Montana Republicans have already filed for his deep-red seat. Politico was first to report that Rosendale was ending his Senate bid. With Rosendale’s exit, Republican will avoid what was expected to be a contentious primary. Several Republicans — including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Montana Sen. Steve Daines, who leads the Senate GOP campaign arm — have backed Sheehy as the party looks to flip the chamber in November. Montana, along with West Virginia and Ohio, is one of three Senate seats Democrats are defending in states twice won by Trump. Rosendale’s candidacy sparked concern among Republicans that if he — a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus who lost an earlier Senate bid to Tester in 2018 — emerged as the primary winner, they would be far less likely to win the seat in November. First elected to the House in 2020, Rosendale previously served in the Montana Legislature and as state auditor. He moved to Montana in 2002, and the former land developer’s Maryland roots were a frequent target of Democratic attacks in his 2018 race against Tester, which the incumbent won by less than 4 points.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/trump-state-prosecutions-new-york-georgia/index.html,"CNN — Two cases that could defy Donald Trump’s capacity to thwart prosecutions and even to overturn eventual convictions against him if he returns to the White House reach critical tests on Thursday with major implications for the 2024 election. In the latest remarkable twist of his multiple legal sagas, Trump is in court in New York for a procedural hearing ahead of his trial over a hush money payment to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Over Trump’s objection, a judge confirmed that his trial will start on March 25 , when jury selection begins. It will mark the first time the fate of an ex-president and potential presidential nominee has been put to a jury in a criminal case. While Trump is in court in New York , he also is at the center of another drama in Georgia where a judge is holding an evidentiary hearing into an attempt to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and to throw out a vast racketeering case against Trump and associates over his attempt to subvert President Joe Biden ’s 2020 election win in the swing state. Judge Scott McAfee has already said that Willis could be disqualified if she benefited financially from a romantic relationship with a colleague she appointed to be a prosecutor in the case. Most of Trump’s legal filings in various cases have one thing in common: an attempt to prevent them from moving to trial and to delay accountability — at least until the next election. Trump has a particular interest in stopping the New York hush money and Georgia election interference cases because even as president with a sympathetic attorney general, he would find it difficult to interfere in ongoing prosecutions, to overturn convictions or even to pardon himself since this executive power does not cover state crimes. The high-stakes hearings nearly 900 miles apart speak to the extraordinary entanglement of the 2024 election and Trump’s legal quagmire that now spans multiple presidential elections. Thursday will not even be the first time this week that the ex-president’s legal plight is playing out in two separate cities. On Monday for instance, Trump was in court in Fort Pierce, Florida, for a hearing over his indictment related to retaining classified documents on a day when his lawyers sent a filing to the US Supreme Court in Washington based on his expansive demands for absolute presidential immunity to shield him from his actions after the 2020 election. Emphasizing his constant double duty in the courtroom and the campaign trial, the former president gave a fiery speech in South Carolina Wednesday night ahead of the state’s primary later this month – before heading to New York. “They’re weaponizing law enforcement for high level election interference — that’s what they’ve done,” he said. “I am being indicted for you, never forget,” Trump told his crowd. “I am delighted to be doing it.” Just before Trump spoke, special counsel Jack Smith sent his reply to Trump’s immunity claims to the Supreme Court, arguing that there was a vital public interest in seeing him tried — though amid the accused’s claims of political persecution, Smith didn’t specifically reference the narrowing calendar before November’s election. In yet another case, another judge in New York is expected to rule on Friday whether Trump will have to pay hundreds of millions in dollars over ill-gotten gains exposed in a civil fraud trial that targeted the ex-president, his adult sons and the Trump Organization. The ruling could remove Trump’s capacity to do business in New York — the city where he made his name. The legal and political collision that seems to become more intense with every passing week makes it all but certain the current election will sow divisive, long-term aftereffects however Trump’s legal perils end that will deepen the country’s political estrangement and further damage trust in electoral and judicial institutions. Trump is back in the city where he made his name The former president is making a habit of showing up in court and staging histrionics to express his contempt for the legal system and to frame the prosecutions he’s facing as political persecution — the dominant theme of his 2024 election campaign. Outside court in New York on Thursday, Trump offered a preview of his tactics ahead of the coming trial, accusing President Joe Biden’s White House of running “election interference.” There is, however, no basis for Trump’s claims that the White House has any role in directing the district attorney’s case. Trump’s presence has the potential to turn any sober legal hearing into a circus, and several judges have become infuriated as they struggle to keep him under control. In the New York case, Trump is facing 34 charges of falsifying business records. He allegedly did so to cover up payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public over an alleged past affair in a way that could influence voters. The ex-president, who denies the affair, has pleaded not guilty in this case, as he has to all four of his criminal indictments. Some legal experts see the New York case as the least serious of the four criminal threats facing the former president, and even if he is convicted, he is not expected to face a jail term. Others, however, see the 2016 case as the first stirrings of Trump’s attempts to mislead voters and to interfere in the conduct of US elections. As the expected first criminal trial, the New York case could still have important political implications. So far, polling evidence and the results of early Republican primary races suggest that Trump’s indictments have served to unite the party’s grass roots voters behind his campaign. But the impact of Trump’s legal problems on a wider electorate is still to be tested. Several recent polls have suggested that some voters could have second thoughts about him if he is a convicted felon by Election Day. A vital sideshow to Trump’s racketeering trial will take place in Georgia In Georgia, McAfee is holding an evidentiary hearing into allegations that Willis benefited financially from a romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade after she hired him. “The issues at point here are whether a relationship existed, whether that relationship was romantic or non-romantic in nature, when it formed and whether it continues,” McAfee said Monday. “And that’s only relevant because it’s in combination with the question of the existence and extent of any benefit conveyed as a result of their relationship.” One of Trump’s co-defendants, Michael Roman, is alleging that Willis and Wade benefited significantly from the case at the expense of taxpayers and that there is a significant conflict of interest. He is citing financial statements from Wade’s divorce proceedings to argue that he took Willis on lavish vacations after she hired him. Roman is calling both for the dismissal of Willis and for the shelving of the entire case, arguing that it has raised questions about fairness in the legal system and that the entire prosecution has been tainted by the drama. But a lawyer for the district attorney is accusing Roman of trying to divert attention from the underlying case. “The defense is not bringing you facts, the defense is not bringing you law, the defense is bringing you gossip,” attorney Anna Cross said. “The court should not condone that practice.” In an amicus brief filed with the court, a group of legal experts, former prosecutors and law professors argued that even if all the allegations against Willis are true, “they do not mandate disqualification here. Indeed they do not come close.” Willis has suggested that the allegations are motivated by race. “Is it that some will never see a Black man as qualified, no matter his achievements?” Willis said last month at Big Bethel AME Church in Atlanta, referencing Wade without specifically naming him. Speaking on CNN “This Morning” in January, Michael Moore, a former US Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said that the allegations against Willis would not be “destructive” to the vast racketeering case against Trump and his fellow defendants. At the same time, however, a change of prosecutor could substantially delay the proceedings, in a way that plays into some of Trump’s goals. At one point, CNN reported, Trump had shown an interest in attending Thursday’s hearing in Georgia rather than the one in New York, but he was convinced that since he was personally affected by the latter case it would make more sense for him to be there. In the likely event that the judge in New York rejects Trump’s dismissal motion, the ex-president is certain to claim that he is being political victimized. And if Willis is not dismissed from the case in Georgia, he is sure to use the mere existence of allegations against her to argue that justice has been tainted and that those seeking to call him to account are corrupt. This does not only have the political effect of solidifying Trump’s appeal to supporters as he claims he’s a victim of witch hunts. It also bolsters his long-term attempts to create a public narrative that any future convictions against him will be unjust."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/donald-trump-ny-defense-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — The coming months are going to provide former President Donald Trump with the reality of campaigning from outside a courtroom. He has, heretofore, chosen to attend various court dates. When his criminal trial in Manhattan gets under way in late March , he could conceivably have locked up the GOP nomination but will have to attend the anticipated six-week trial or ask the judge to be excused. We got a preview of this unprecedented criminal trial mixed with a presidential campaign on Thursday at a key hearing in the New York criminal case. This time, Trump had a choice – he might also have attended a hearing in Georgia, where District Attorney Fani Willis, who is overseeing his election interference case in the state, faces allegations of misconduct related to her relationship with a prosecutor she appointed to oversee the case, a soap opera on the side of the Trump trials. Trump routinely manipulates the media spectacle outside court by rambling on about his criminal prosecutions and his political rivals. The details vary, but the main talking points stay largely the same and are repeated on a loop: political persecution, crime-ridden cities and his strong polling. Here’s some of what Trump said Thursday in New York before heading into the courtroom, along with context. Everything that I’ve heard and read, even from legal scholars, said there’s absolutely no case here. It’s not a crime. This is not a crime. It’s not clear what legal scholars Trump is referring to, but he says he’s not guilty of crimes in all four of the criminal cases he’s facing. He will repeat variations of “this is not a crime” as a kind of mantra throughout these comments. This particular case, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg , relates to hush-money payments to squash three separate, negative stories before the 2016 election. Payments were made to a former Trump Tower doorman by the parent company of the National Enquirer, American Media Inc., to buy the doorman’s story about an alleged Trump affair and Trump-fathered child. It was a “catch and kill” effort by the Enquirer, which never published the story it had bought. The Trump Organization has denied the affair allegation. Six-figure payments were also made by AMI to “catch and kill” the story of a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with Trump. He denies it. Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen also paid $130,000 to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels through a shell company days before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels said she had an affair with Trump in 2006. Trump denies the allegation. But he compensated Cohen for the Daniels payment, and his company described the payment to Daniels as legal expenses. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payments and served time in jail. Trump was never charged by federal prosecutors, perhaps in part because the Department of Justice has a policy of not prosecuting presidents. The crime Trump is now accused of in New York is 34 counts of falsifying business records and misrepresenting the payments in order to influence the 2016 election. When you look at what’s going on outside on the streets, where violent crime is at an all-time high, I think it’s very, very – it’s a great double standard. Claiming violent crime in cites, especially those run by Democrats, is one of Trump’s favorite talking points. The idea that violent crime is at an “all-time high” is completely untrue, as CNN’s Daniel Dale wrote last October. Crime rates have fallen since then. In data released by the New York City Police Department , rates of murder, rape, assault, burglary and car theft were all down in January 2024 compared with January 2023. Robbery and grand larceny increased. Dale pointed out in his fact check that the actual violent crime rates were much higher decades ago, when these horrible records were set. It’s also worth noting that Trump is trying to compare his white-collar crimes with violent crimes, which seems like a false comparison. There are nonviolent crimes that are still crimes. Whether Trump is guilty will be up to a jury. We’re here for something that is not a crime. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. What it is is election interference. It’s being run by Joe Biden’s White House. His top person was placed here in order to make sure everything goes right. This is a terrible time for our country. This is a real dark period for our country. Trump often repeats this claim that his four, separate criminal trials are a coordinated “election interference” scheme. Not only does it flip the script on the fact that it is he who has been charged in state court in Georgia and federal court in Washington, DC, with election interference, but it also plays into his larger claim that anything opposed to him is part of a “witch hunt.” It’s false and ridiculous to think that these cases are all coordinated by the Biden administration. A special counsel, Jack Smith , appointed to be autonomous from the Justice Department, is overseeing the two federal criminal prosecutions. Bragg is overseeing this hush-money prosecution. Willis is overseeing the Georgia state election case. Anyone ranking the severity of trials against Trump would probably like to see his federal election interference trial go first on the calendar. But the judge in Manhattan has filled Trump’s calendar at the end of March, when that federal trial could theoretically have taken place. The federal trial date is on hold while the Supreme Court considers Trump’s argument that he has absolute immunity from prosecution for acts conducted while he was president. (Biden’s) top person, Colangelo, and some others have been placed into the DA’s office to make sure they do a good job of election interference. There’s never been anything like this in the history of our country. What is this? While Trump first alleged that Biden “stuffed” the Manhattan DA’s office last year before he was indicted, this new detail is a head scratcher. Dale explains that Matthew Colangelo is a former Justice Department official who is now a senior counsel to Bragg. Their relationship predates Colangelo’s time at the Department of Justice. There is also a pattern of Trump seeking to question people in the justice system. In his civil fraud trial in the case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, for instance, he seized on a clerk to the judge and alleged she was tied to Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader. The details will change, but Trump finding a person to demonize is predictable. With all of this being said, I look outside, I look at the streets. It’s so different from when I left New York. It’s so different. It’s dirty and it’s crime-ridden. And today, you walk down the street, you get mugged or you get shot. And they are doing this where literally legal experts, legal scholars said they don’t understand that there’s no crime, and there was no crime here at all. He’s looping. See above. This is just a way of hurting me in the election because I’m leading by a lot. We’re leading by numbers that nobody’s ever seen before. Trump is certainly leading, and perhaps untouchable, in the race for the Republican nomination. In many polls, he does currently have a slim lead in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But his lead is far from unprecedented. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan are Republicans who won true landslide victories, carrying nearly every state in a general election. No one is talking about that kind of victory for Trump. They figure this is their way of cheating this time. Last time, they had a different way. This time, they have something that’s really down and dirty that, no, frankly, no country does other than a third-world country, a banana republic. There is not now and there has never been evidence of systemic or widespread cheating to defeat Trump in either 2016 or 2020, although he has alleged as much for both elections. It is certainly true that political rivals in weak democracies and autocracies face political prosecutions. Look at Alexey Navalny and multiple other critics of President Vladimir Putin who have been jailed after questionable prosecutions in Russia. But to compare the US judicial system to that of a banana republic is ridiculous. Juries will determine Trump’s guilt or innocence. A Supreme Court with three Trump-appointed justices has final review of the system that is prosecuting him. So we’re going to do our process. They want to rush it because they want to get it desperately before the election. By “they,” Trump presumably means all of the distinct authorities trying to prosecute him. By “our process,” he means his strategy of delay, delay, delay. Trump’s legal strategy is to win the election. If he wins in November, the likely outcome is that his two federal cases, if unresolved, would go away. State prosecutions are different. It’s not clear that a state could not prosecute a president or a president-elect, but any prosecutions would certainly be complicated. After the election, they wouldn’t have brought, this except for the fact, no way, except for the fact I’m running for president and doing well. If I were doing poorly, they wouldn’t have brought it. Trump’s prosecutions actually seem to have helped him in the Republican nomination race. His base has rallied around him, and his rivals have been unable to gain a serious foothold. We want delays, obviously, I’m running for election. I can’t – how can you run for election if you’re sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again, this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be at a courthouse. Actually, given the choice, Trump has frequently attended court hearings over campaign events – either in his criminal cases or in his $370 million civil fraud trial, where a verdict is expected as soon as Friday. Dale writes in a fact check that, no, Trump was not stuck in court today. The former president did not need to appear for this hearing. He had no South Carolina events scheduled and plans to fly back to Florida after the hearing. When he says “other people,” he’s referring to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his last remaining serious rival for the Republican nomination. Polling suggests he has a commanding lead over Haley in her home state as the GOP primary there approaches. Virtually every legal scholar says they don’t understand it, that there’s no crime. Even if he was guilty of something, there’s no crime. So I will say that, uh, enjoy it. Here, he’s both looping and making the provocative claim that he could be guilty but not be a criminal. It’s a sad thing. It’s a sad day for New York. They really do, look, I love this city and I love this state. They have to focus on violent crime taking place outside. You have a new form of crime now. You have migrant crime. Migrants are trying to beat up our police officers. They’re trying to do things that we’ve never seen before, actually. We are going to have a problem with – I call it Biden migrant crime, because you have millions of people who came into this place, this country that has been so badly hurt and they are they are doing things that nobody’s ever seen before. So you have violent migrant crime. Trump has built his presidential campaign around two main pillars: retribution for his 2020 loss, which he still does not accept, and being tougher on border policy. Here he marries the twin pillars of his campaign with the phrase “Biden migrant crime.” In New York, officials are dealing with a crush of asylum-seeking migrants who have been bused to the city from Texas and elsewhere. New York’s mayor has complained about the strain on the city and its services. And he has also recently helped feed the notion that crime in the city is being perpetrated by migrants, who under federal rules cannot obtain a work permit until they have been in the country for six months. More than 150,000 migrants have arrived in New York City, and there have been viral videos of migrants involved in criminal activity. But as The New York Times notes , despite the rising number of migrants in the city, violent crime has dropped. And they’re after me for doing nothing wrong. You know, I paid almost $300 million in taxes over the period of time. $300 million. And they say, oh, let’s get Trump out. You have people that – it’s everything is politics in this city, including decisions and judges and everything else. It has to straighten out and they have to focus on violent crime, not made-up crime. Wait, what? Trump has persistently refused to release his tax returns so his claim that he paid $300 million in taxes “over the period of time” is unverifiable. If a person is a money-making billionaire, it’s possible that paying $300 million represents a lower tax rate than many other Americans. Is he referring to federal taxes? State taxes? We do know, because some years of his returns were leaked, that there were years in which he paid no federal income tax because he claimed massive losses from previous years. In the year he won the White House and in his first year as president, he paid $750 in federal income taxes. We also know that Trump’s general outlook on taxes is to pay as little as possible."

CNN — The immigration and border crisis is quickly morphing into the dominant issue of American politics – and Democrats are pivoting faster than Republicans at the moment. GOP lawmakers have long claimed immigration as their top issue, raising the alarm about the drastic rise of migrants and asylum-seekers at the southern border. Blaming President Joe Biden for the border crisis is the backbone of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. But after a defeat in a special election to fill a New York House seat, Republicans might be wondering if they are being outmaneuvered by Democrats who are adjusting to acknowledge the crisis and suddenly preaching bipartisanship. A drastic, new migrant policy under consideration by the Biden administration will only heap pressure on Republicans to relent and seek middle ground with the White House even as they complain about Biden’s current policy. Here’s what’s happened with immigration so far this week: Republicans, committed to casting blame, impeach Mayorkas. It took two tries, but House Republicans made their point and voted by the narrowest possible margin to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , the first impeachment of a Cabinet secretary since the 1870s. The Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, will surely acquit Mayorkas or figure out a way to dismiss the charges, but not without an unwanted spectacle. There are consequences for failing to legislate. After the failure of a bipartisan Senate compromise to revamp border policy and add funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Biden administration has drawn up a draft contingency plan to address a massive budget shortfall by cutting detention capacity and releasing thousands of immigrants. The House GOP majority shrank. It’s a good thing for the Republicans who supported the impeachment that they got it done Tuesday night, since Democrats picked up a seat in the special election to replace disgraced former Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from the House in December. Democrats are triangulating. How did the winner in New York, former Rep. Tom Suozzi , win back his old seat? He tacked to the middle specifically on the issue of immigration, hammering Republicans for refusing to work with Democrats on an immigration compromise. “Let’s send a message to our friends running the Congress these days: Stop running around for Trump, and start running the country,” Suozzi told supporters after claiming victory Tuesday night. A migrant family leaves the Row Hotel in midtown Manhattan January 10, 2024. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Immigration is a major issue in New York City. Immigration might have been the issue on which Republicans could have kept the seat despite the bad taste Santos may have left in voters’ mouths. A serial fabulist who misrepresented just about everything in his background, Santos is set to be prosecuted for, among other things, defrauding donors to his 2022 campaign. But New York is feeling the pinch of the immigration crisis. Mayor Eric Adams has complained the city can no longer cope with the thousands of migrants being shipped to the city by, among others, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Republicans say NBD. Even though Suozzi’s win shrinks the narrow House Republican majority even further and makes it more difficult for Speaker Mike Johnson to pass any legislation, Johnson told fellow GOP lawmakers not to panic during a closed-door meeting Wednesday, according to CNN’s Capitol Hill team. Later, he noted that Democrats spent more money on the race than Republicans and told reporters that Suozzi won because he “ran like a Republican.” “He sounded like a Republican, talking about the border and immigration, because everybody knows that’s the top issue,” Johnson said. Except voters concerned about immigration told CNN reporters that it was also dysfunction on Capitol Hill – Republicans rejected even the idea of a bipartisan immigration deal last week – that drove their votes. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate joined together to pass a foreign aid package this week after it was decoupled from the border compromise. But Johnson opposes allowing votes on that bill too. This is the definition of a catch-22. Without any irony after helping kill the border compromise, Johnson said he could not accept any aid for Ukraine and Israel until there is action on the border. “House Republicans were crystal clear from the very beginning of discussions that any so-called national security supplemental legislation must recognize that national security begins at our own border,” Johnson said in a statement, days after helping kill legislation to address the situation at the border. Democrats are embracing the rhetoric of bipartisanship – for now. Reacting to Suozzi’s victory, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that voters respond to people who want to solve problems. “Tom Suozzi talked about common-sense solutions. And finding bipartisan common ground. Tom Suozzi won,” Jeffries said. Fight or flight? It’s perfectly reasonable to wonder why anyone would want to work on Capitol Hill. Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin , one of three Republicans to vote against impeaching Mayorkas, was surrounded and pressured by colleagues on the House floor last week during the first impeachment effort. Days later, he announced he would not run for reelection. “Electoral politics was never supposed to be a career and, trust me, Congress is no place to grow old,” Gallagher, who had been viewed as a rising star in the party, said in a statement. Compare that with former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan , an anti-Trump Republican who recently announced he would run for a seat in the US Senate after previously saying he had no interest in working on Capitol Hill. He still isn’t exactly excited about it, Hogan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “Inside Politics” on Wednesday. “Who in their right mind would want to go in and be a part of that divisiveness and dysfunction?” Hogan asked. But he made the decision a week ago, he said, after the “debacle that took place on the Senate floor” when the bipartisan immigration deal was abandoned. Biden, he argued, has failed to secure the border. But Republicans, given the opportunity to work toward a solution, backed off. “I thought it was typical dysfunction,” he later added. “I’m frustrated with both parties down there, and that’s a perfect example – it’s an important thing that most people in America want us to solve, and it’s not getting solved because it’s just typical Washington politics.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/congress-trump-nato-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — Lawmakers from both parties last December may have been anticipating former President Donald Trump’s current NATO trash talk when they quietly slipped language limiting a president’s power to pull the US out the alliance into the annual defense policy bill , which passed with bipartisan support. Trump boasted at a weekend campaign rally that as president he told an unidentified NATO leader that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” with member countries who are in arrears on defense spending. The whole point of NATO is supposed to be that members act to defend each other if attacked. President Joe Biden seized on Trump’s recent NATO bashing, suggesting in Tuesday remarks from the White House that Trump was the first president who “bowed down” to a Russian dictator, which Biden said was “dumb,” “shameful,” “dangerous” and “un-American.” Add that criticism to a chorus of alarm from NATO and European officials after Trump’s comments and in the midst of House Republicans’ blockage of additional aid for Ukraine. Trump’s desire to pull out of NATO The post-World War II alliance of Western democracies was built around NATO, but Trump has long complained that the US is getting a raw deal with the organization, paying too much and getting too little. Trump’s ultimate goal, writes CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen , has long been to pull the US out of NATO, which was formed in 1949 to contain the threat of the Soviet Union and the spread of communism and is now organized around deterring Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN’s Jim Sciutto, in a forthcoming book , quotes a former official in both the Trump and Biden administrations who predicts a Trump election win in November would mean “the US will be out of NATO.” Sciutto also writes about how Trump nearly pulled the US from the alliance during a 2018 NATO meeting. At the same time, Trump tried to claim credit, arguing it is his tough talk and not the threat of Russian invasion that has caused NATO member countries to increase their defense budgets in recent years. What’s to stop him? If Trump wins the 2024 election and does turn on NATO, he would run into that new language from Congress, which says the president “shall not suspend, terminate, denounce, or withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty” without either a supermajority vote in the Senate or an act passed by the full Congress. When I asked the former US Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker about what Trump could do to undermine NATO as president, he first pointed out that Trump was boasting about his interaction with an unnamed world leader rather than promising future action. Kurt Volker testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on November 19, 2019, in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The Constitution, Volker noted, says the Senate must be involved with ratifying treaties but it is silent on the subject of withdrawing from a treaty. Any court battle could take years. Alternatives to withdrawal Rather than attempting to withdraw from NATO, a second Trump presidency could allow his allies to pursue a policy of making NATO “ dormant ,” an idea pushed by at least one Trump-allied think tank. Nobody knows exactly what that would look like, Volker said, but the president has immense power over how the US interacts with its allies. “There’s lots of things that you can do administratively as the commander in chief that would still be very disruptive for NATO,” Volker said. A president could reduce the number of exercises Americans take part in with NATO allies, further reduce troop presence in Europe, withhold payments to the NATO infrastructure or cut down on the US military budget. The US would still be bound, under this type of scenario, by the pledge to defend other NATO nations, but it would not be prepared. “It’s not just enough to say, yes, we will fight together,” said Volker. “You actually have to have the capabilities.” Americans lead NATO by design If Trump wins the election this year and then seeks as president to reduce American military participation, he could, in theory, recall the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower first held the job after NATO’s founding, and ever since, the top NATO commander has always been an American admiral or general. NATO’s power to deter attacks on other countries rests in large part on American nuclear weapons, and so it is appropriate that an American service member sits atop the NATO structure, according to Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. This December 1957 photo shows heads of government, including US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, attending the annual ""family portrait"" during NATO top-level meetings at the Palais de Chaillot. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Pulling American generals out of NATO might force other NATO countries to seek their own nuclear deterrents. Part of the reason Europeans have not pursued a collective European military is by American design and a result of security provided by NATO, Bergmann said. Countries are eager to be protected by Article 5 of NATO’s charter, which is the principle that an attack on one member is an attack on all of the members. Sweden and Finland have both worked hard to join after Russia invaded non-member Ukraine. Finland joined in 2023, and Sweden is inching closer to accession . That provision that Trump dislikes has only been invoked one time, after 9/11, when the US and NATO allies invaded Afghanistan after terror attacks brought down the World Trade Center and struck the Pentagon. More members hit 2% benchmark Trump frequently complains that NATO members other than the US don’t pay dues, which is a misstatement of facts . Members are supposed to spend a minimum of 2% of their GDP on defense, but it is just a guideline that doesn’t require payments to NATO or the US. Multiple NATO countries do not hit that benchmark, although spending has risen since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “That argument is weaker and weaker, because allies are indeed spending more and doing more,” Volker said. NATO’s charter is a relatively short and simple document. Its section on how a country withdraws from the alliance is further evidence of how central the US is to the organization: A country wishing to withdraw must notify the US a year before it plans to withdraw. No country, by the way, has ever withdrawn from NATO, although France did not take part in NATO’s military operations from the mid-1960s until 2009. A difficult relationship to unbreak If Trump is reelected and chooses to hollow out NATO or make US participation dormant, it would sever ties that future presidents might have trouble repairing. “It’s just like any relationship,” said Bergmann of the likelihood of permanent damage if Trump were to materially alter the NATO alliance. “This would be seen as the US basically having a massive affair and like cheating on Europe. Could the marriage be restored? Well, potentially. But it would require, I think, a lot of effort on the part of future administrations.” Marco Rubio is not worried Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was a sponsor of the new law meant to prohibit a president from leaving NATO. Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, he dismissed the threat posed by Trump. “He’s telling a story,” Rubio said, adding, “He doesn’t talk like a traditional politician, and we’ve already been through this. You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.” “I have zero concern, because he’s been president before. I know exactly what he has done and will do with the NATO alliance,” Rubio said, although he added, “But there has to be an alliance.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/new-york-special-election-biden-trump/index.html,"CNN — Democrats, when confronted with President Joe Biden ’s poor polling numbers, often counter with some form of the following: “Polls are polls, but when people vote, Democrats are doing well.” The idea being that Democrats have done well in major special and off-year elections since the 2022 midterms. The special election in New York’s 3rd Congressional District to succeed the infamous George Santos offers perhaps the best chance to test Democrats’ theory ahead of the presidential election. Does former Rep. Tom Suozzi win in yet another example of Democrats defying national polling trends? Or does Nassau County Legislator Mazi Pilip secure victory, showing how Republicans are winning pivotal races in places Biden comfortably won in 2020? Yes, we’re looking at just one election on Long Island, but it’s a fascinating one. As we enter Election Day, the race seems far too close to call. A Newsday/Siena College poll released last week put Suozzi at 48% and Pilip at 44%, a result well within the margin of error. Throw in forecasted bad weather in this Nassau County and eastern Queens district, and we really can’t be certain who will emerge victorious. The fact that the race is tight makes sense if you look at the district’s recent voting record . I mentioned that Biden carried the seat in 2020 (by 8 points), but local Republicans have been dominating since. They did well in 2023’s local races . GOP candidates for governor and US Senate won the district by margins between 4 and 12 points in 2022, as did Santos. This means that even a narrow Suozzi victory would be impressive for Democrats given how well Republicans have done in other elections in the area. Indeed, outside of Long Island, Democrats did well in last year’s big elections. They won the Kentucky gubernatorial election , maintained their majority in the Virginia Senate and flipped the Virginia House . The candidate favored by Democrats won a Wisconsin Supreme Court race , which gave the more liberal justices a majority on that court. A lot of analysts (myself included) have been skeptical about making too much of these results. Turnout in off-year elections is often low. Voters who have been showing up for these off-year races have been more Democratic-leaning than their share of all registered voters in the same states and districts     . Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at the Hyatt Hotel in Coralville, Iowa, on December 13. Scott Olson/Getty Images Related article Why Donald Trump should be hoping for high voter turnout Of course, we’re now in a presidential election year, and there are also signs that these off-year results may have been pointing at something important. Yes, the turnout may have been more Democratic than among all registered voters. But the turnout in the presidential election may be as well. Most national pollsters are gauging responses from registered voters. Not all registered voters will cast a ballot in the presidential election. When pollsters such as Ipsos and The New York Times have honed on either those certain to vote or those likely to vote this year, Biden has done significantly better against his likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump . Ipsos, for example, recently showed a 5-point lead for the former president among registered voters becoming a tie among those certain to vote. A Suozzi win would further prove the point that Democrats do well when voters are treated to an actual campaign. On the other hand, a win by Pilip would give us a different narrative. This is the only federal election since the midterms that has been remotely competitive. All the other competitive races were state elections, and voting patterns between US House and presidential elections are far more correlated than they are for state offices and presidential elections. While it would be easy to dismiss a Pilip win by saying that Long Island has swung to the right since 2020, the rest of the country may have as well. Remember that in the last high-turnout election (the 2022 midterms), Republicans won control of the US House . They did so while winning the House popular vote by 3 points. That Republican victory represented a 6-point swing from the 2020 House elections . Moreover, that 3-point Republican edge in 2022 looks a lot like Trump’s current advantage over Biden among registered voters nationally. In other words, it’s possible that the national environment hasn’t moved all that much from the last time Republicans secured an important win. So a victory by Pilip would suggest that perhaps things aren’t all that different from where we were in 2022. This would mean that we have a closely divided electorate, but one with which Republicans are favored. Either way, you can bet your last dollar that both sides will try to spin the New York special election result. What else would you expect when there’s been more than $10 million spent on ads , which I can report have been playing nonstop on local television."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/trump-appeal-scotus-delay-tactic-analysis/index.html,"Donald Trump’s filing to the Supreme Court over his claim for sweeping presidential immunity begins with a quote from Yogi Berra. “This application is déjà vu all over again,” the former president’s lawyers write, noting that special counsel Jack Smith had tried and failed to get the nine justices to decide the question on a fast-track basis in December. But another of the late and revered New York Yankees catcher’s phrases offers a better summation of Trump’s interminable delay-at-all-costs legal strategy designed to defer a reckoning until after November’s election — “It ain’t over till it’s over.” The ex-president asked the Supreme Court on Monday to step in to temporarily block a US Court of Appeals decision that last week eviscerated his claims that a president is effectively above the law while in office and shielded from prosecution afterwards. The filing is Trumpian in its audacity. In essence, it argues that it would be unfair to millions of voters if the ex-President cannot get his message out in the 2024 election because he is on trial over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The former president was less concerned about the rights of voters when he sought to thwart their choice to eject him from office in 2020. After an unprecedented effort by Trump to interrupt the cherished tradition of peaceful transfers of power three years ago, Trump’s attorneys nevertheless insist the real “stunning breach of precedent and historical norms” is that the lower court ruled that presidential immunity for official acts does not exist at all. While Trump argues he was using presidential power in a legitimate effort to bring to light electoral fraud, there is nothing in the Constitution that gives the president the right or duty to officially administer elections, count votes or contact local election officials as the ex-president is alleged to have done. The coming days could decide when the first Trump trial takes place The text of Trump’s filing to the court at times feels somewhat frivolous. In tone and depth, it contrasts to the tightly argued repudiation of his claims for immunity last week by three appeals court judges that was widely praised by legal scholars. And it reflected the extraordinarily broad and improbable vision of almost unconstrained presidential power to which Trump warmed in office and that he appears to relish regaining if he wins November’s election ahead of a term he has vowed would be devoted to retribution against his enemies. “This brief, this petition for a stay, is pretty weak,” Ty Cobb, a former counsel in Trump’s White House, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “I don’t think the Supreme Court is going to find these arguments compelling in any way.” Trump’s latest request comes at a critical moment because the steps that the Supreme Court takes in coming days will likely decide whether this case — one of the most potentially damaging of the four criminal trials that await Trump — will go to a jury before the election. This is not just a matter of seeking accountability for the ex-president’s bid to stay in power despite losing the last election to President Joe Biden. It could also sway the destiny of the White House since some polls, including a national NBC News survey this month , suggest that some Trump voters may not support him if he’s a convicted felon when they go to vote. In what is expected to be a close election, even small-scale defections from Biden could weigh on the result. Trump’s legal team has a good reason to try to run out the clock. Therefore its moves should be assessed as much for their political impact as for the quality of litigation in an election season that has merged Trump’s legal and campaign strategies. Trump asked the Supreme Court to put the entire case on hold to allow him to pursue the full extent of his rights as an appellant, potentially to include a so-called en banc appeal to a full bench of appeals court judges and then ultimately to the high court, a process that could take many weeks or months. But it is not certain that the Supreme Court, which last week heard oral arguments on another Trump case — over his expulsion from Colorado’s ballot — will even agree to take his latest request. The special counsel has until February 20 to respond to Trump’s petition, though Smith is likely to file much earlier. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the real world impact of the new petition was that it would “almost certainly dictate whether or not Donald Trump goes on trial on Jack Smith’s election case before or after the 2024 election.” First, the Supreme Court must decide whether to grant a stay, but Honig said, “The bigger question is: Will the Supreme Court ultimately take this case? If they do not take the case it’s going to go back down to the district court, and I think we are very likely looking at a trial this summer. If they do take the case and set it on something close to a normal schedule, I think in all likelihood that would push the timeline here out until after the 2024 election — that’s how big the stakes are.” Norm Eisen, another CNN legal analyst, said that the court would likely grant some kind of stay, but that even if it did decide to take the case, the court could put it on an expedited schedule. “The long-term odds for success are poor. But it’s a delay game at this point,” Eisen said. But Trump and Smith both know time is short with a trial threatening to coincide with the heat of the presidential election. “The really precarious situation that Jack Smith finds themselves in and the Justice Department find themselves in is that every day matters at this point, given the calendar and the political calendar,” Ankush Khardori, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I don’t expect them to countenance the whole delaying tactic, at least I hope that they will not, but we are now starting to cut it pretty close here.” Trump’s extraordinary collision of legal peril As is often the case, Trump had a crowded legal docket on Monday. The historic spectacle of a former president making an unprecedented request for blanket immunity — that appears to fly in the face of founding US principles of constraining unaccountable executive power — only emerged after an earlier court appearance. The former president took part in a closed hearing in Florida as his lawyers haggled with Smith’s team for access to classified material pertinent to the case over his hoarding of secret government documents at his resort home. As with Smith’s Washington case, Trump’s team is seeking to delay the trial currently scheduled for May. The former president is also expected in court on Thursday in Manhattan, in a hearing related to a hush money payment sent to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. That case is now expected to be the first of Trump’s four criminal trials to go ahead at the end of March — after the judge in the federal elections case postponed the start of her proceeding pending the ex-president’s appeals. Trump is hoping meanwhile that Fani Willis, the district attorney leading his Georgia election subversion case, could be dismissed following the disclosure of a personal relationship with a lead prosecutor. A hearing is set for Thursday after a judge presiding over the case said Willis could be disqualified if she financially benefited from the relationship. And in yet another fateful development in court his week for Trump, a New York judge is expected to issue his ruling on Friday over how much Trump will have to pay over ill-gotten gains related to a civil fraud trial targeting the former President, the Trump Organization and his adult sons. A large chunk of Trump’s fortune is at risk in the case as well as his capacity to do business in New York state. This stunning roster of cases is an oppressive load for any defendant — let alone one running for president – but it does not even complete the full extent of his legal liabilities. However, it raises the prospect of a dark period ahead for Trump if he doesn’t win the 2024 election and is not able to use presidential power to halt trials or reverse convictions in any of the federal proceedings against him. This story has been updated with additional developments."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — While the 2024 presidential race seems set in stone as a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, it’s also true that things happen. Back in November 1872, for instance, the newspaper publisher and Democratic presidential candidate Horace Greeley died after Election Day but before the casting of Electoral College votes. While it did not affect the outcome – President Ulysses S. Grant easily won reelection – Greeley’s death created the difficult question of what to do with the 66 Electoral College votes he had won. Most electors, meeting in state capitols, did not cast votes for the deceased Greeley, but rather split them among four other candidates . Congress did not count the three votes that were cast for a dead man. Pictured is American abolitionist, journalist and politician Horace Greeley, who edited the New York Tribune. MPI/Getty Images In the more than 150 years since Greeley’s death, there have been two constitutional amendments related to presidential succession, but there is still some gray area when it comes to an unforeseen event that strikes a presidential nominee or candidate. Today, polling suggests voters are worried that both Trump and Biden are too old for the job. Trump will be 78 on Election Day in November, and Biden will turn 82 later that month. Without being macabre, it’s worth knowing what would happen if, for whatever reason, either man was unable to continue with the race. Replacing either man on the ballot – not that anyone is seriously talking about it – would be a messy and chaotic process that would uncover divisions and disagreements within the political parties. No one knows for sure what would happen if a candidate died or for some reason needed to withdraw from the race. Here’s a look at the rules for Republicans and Democrats as they currently stand. What happens if a candidate cannot continue his or her campaign? The process of replacing a presidential candidate very much depends on when the vacancy occurs – during the primary process and before the party convention; during the convention or after the convention; or before or after people vote in November. What happens if a vacancy occurs during the primary process? While Trump and Biden are in total command of the respective races to be the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, that process will play out between now and June as states conduct primaries and caucuses and assign delegates based on the results. If a vacancy on either side happens before most of those primaries were to occur, it’s possible that another candidate could emerge and rack up some delegates. But since filing deadlines have already passed for many primaries, it’s unlikely any single candidate, other than Trump or Biden, could rack up enough delegates to win the nomination before party conventions this summer. It is, however, possible that states could decide to delay their primaries, according to Elaine Kamarck , a member of the Democratic National Committee rules committee and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied the issue. Republicans will hold their convention in Milwaukee in July, and Democrats will hold theirs just to the south in Chicago in August. Most delegates will have been awarded by the end of March. Biden has not faced serious opposition in the Democratic primary, has won every delegate at stake so far and needs to win at least 1,968 of 3,934 to secure the nomination on the first ballot of voting. On the Republican side, Trump has won every contest so far and ultimately needs 1,215 of 2,429 delegates. His top rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, is far behind Trump in the delegate race. What if a vacancy occurs after the primaries and before or during the convention? If the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would likely decide the party’s nominee on the convention floor. That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. There would be a messy political battle in every state over who would get to be a delegate (if the vacancy happened before many of those people were chosen) and then who they would ultimately support. Even people who did not run primary campaigns could ultimately be considered. You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to be on the ballot if, for some reason, Biden left the race. At the same time, given Haley’s weakness in primaries, it seems unlikely that Republicans would coalesce around her if Trump was unable to run. On the Democratic side, there would also be another group to consider: the “superdelegates,” a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can’t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they’re free to vote on subsequent ballots. Has anything like this ever happened before? The modern primary and caucus system evolved only in recent generations as voters demanded more involvement in the nominating process. The election that sparked change was in 1968, when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run after an embarrassing finish in New Hampshire’s primary. Johnson won, but just barely. When he dropped out of the presidential race, it set off a chaotic dash to replace him. One candidate who jumped in the race, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Los Angeles just after winning the California primary, creating the difficult question of who his delegates should support. The ultimate Democratic winner that year, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, amassed his delegates in states that did not conduct primaries, securing enough support to win the nomination. Violence on the streets of Chicago around the convention marred the event and helped inspire the system of primaries and caucuses we have today where voters pick presidential candidates through delegates bound to support a specific candidate. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party’s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrats – The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership. Republicans – If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth Congressional Research Service memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party’s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party’s nominee. Neither party, according to CRS, requires that the presidential candidate’s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, but that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health). The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern’s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-biden-election-2024/index.html,"CNN — President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are each offering a stark glimpse at the political liabilities that have many Americans wishing they had other options in 2024. Biden, 81, is angrily refuting questions about his age and memory, struggling to lay to rest anxiety among voters that he wouldn’t be capable of serving a full second term. But far from exploiting the president’s rough patch, Trump offered a stunning display of extremism at the weekend, raising fresh questions over his fitness for the Oval Office. The comparison between the likely general election opponents helps explain why polls show limited enthusiasm for both men, each of whom is unpopular outside their core constituencies. Biden would be the more conventional choice because Trump is promising one of the most tumultuous second terms in US history. But as the president’s campaign gathers pace, his troubles are complicating his effort to convince Americans that Trump would destroy American democracy and would shatter the country’s reputation abroad. Trump is giving every impression that his second term would be even more aberrant than his first, as he vows to use presidential power to exact retribution against his enemies. But he’s nevertheless closely matched with Biden in polling and has a real chance to win. While a Biden vs. Trump race would be a rematch of 2020, it would not necessarily be the same. The sitting president is four years older, and age questions are even more acute. And Trump is even more radical and unchained than when he left office. How Biden and Trump are putting their political weaknesses on display The different liabilities both would bring to the race were on display during the frantic last few days. In Trump, voters can pick an ex-president facing 91 criminal charges who has been found liable for fraud, sexual battery and defamation in court. Trump, 77, tried to stay in power after losing reelection in 2020. This weekend, Trump sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over NATO allies and mocked the military service of GOP rival Nikki Haley’s husband. This week, the ex-president faces a set of court deadlines and hearings that will renew the focus on his seemingly endless threats to the rule of law. In Biden, voters must decide whether to reelect the oldest president ever, at 81, who is angrily refuting claims of a declining memory following a damning assessment of his faculties by a special counsel. The president, who warns Trump is a danger to democracy , is visibly aging while mixing up the names of foreign leaders , and polls show overwhelming skepticism among the public about his reelection plans. The key question voters will face is not whether Biden is fit to serve as commander in chief now, but rather: Will he still be by the end of a second term, when he would be 86? Multiple polls have shown how little voters like the alternatives they will almost certainly get in the 2024 election. And while partisans may already be locked in, the comparison between the sitting president and the former one, both of whom crave a second term, will be critical in the handful of swing states where a relatively small number of voters will be decisive. The debate over Biden’s age and Trump’s fitness for office help explain why there’s a possibility that several third-party or independent candidates — for instance, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — could have an outsize impact on the destiny of the White House. But while speculation will mount about how either party might thwart a 2020 election replay, practical impediments make the idea of dumping a potential nominee an almost unthinkable scenario. Trump’s wild weekend tear Over the weekend, Trump showed how his uncontrolled stream of rhetoric and insults can often be politically counterproductive and play into the core narratives of Biden’s campaign. In a shocking remark at a rally in South Carolina on Saturday, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that didn’t meet the alliance’s guidelines for defense spending. Trump’s comments reveal his view of NATO not as the main driver of peace in Europe for half a century but as a protection racket. His comments are also dangerous, since the alliance’s credibility relies on Russia believing that members would defend an ally that was attacked, in line with Article 5 commitments. Any sense this is false could lead to miscalculations in Moscow. And this is just the latest in a long list of occasions in which the ex-president has appeared to indulge Putin’s goals instead of traditional US national interests. Biden warned in a statement that his likely opponent was unsuitable to be commander in chief. “Donald Trump’s admission that he intends to give Putin a greenlight for more war and violence, to continue his brutal assault against a free Ukraine, and to expand his aggression to the people of Poland and the Baltic States are appalling and dangerous,” Biden said. Trump’s defenders insist his comments are merely a ruse to get NATO members — some of whom are still short of their targets — to spend more on defense. Defense spending rose in some cases following Trump’s pressure in his first term — although his ranting about NATO members not paying their “bills” was not the only factor. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who was a conventional hawkish conservative when he ran against Trump in 2016, defended the ex-president Sunday. “Donald Trump is not a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,” Rubio said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “He doesn’t talk like a traditional politician, and we’ve already been through this. You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.” Still, Trump caused alarm in Europe. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, called his remarks “reckless.” And Trump’s statement will refuel speculation about the odd nature of his relationship with Putin, who is accused of war crimes and has directly targeted civilians in Ukraine. It will also renew fears that Trump would try to pull the US out of NATO if he’s reelected, which would delight Russia. Trump’s comments also come as his GOP allies, especially in the House, are trying to thwart Biden’s new aid package for Ukraine, a sovereign democracy invaded by the Russian autocrat in the widest European land war since World War II. And the sympathetic interview of Putin last week by Tucker Carlson, the far-right populist broadcaster, only underscores the Trump GOP’s embrace of Putinism. Former President Donald Trump speaks in Conway, South Carolina, on February 10, 2024. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Trump’s contempt for those who serve in the military — was also highlighted in his South Carolina speech. He asked of Haley’s husband, Michael: “Where is he? He’s gone,” apparently arguing that his rival’s spouse knew her campaign would not do well. Michael Haley is on a yearlong deployment in Africa. Nikki Haley targeted Trump on X, saying: “Michael is deployed serving our country, something you know nothing about. Someone who continually disrespects the sacrifices of military families has no business being commander in chief.” This is far from the first time that Trump has disparaged the military service of political opponents. He’s still attacking the late Arizona Sen. John McCain after mocking his incarceration and the injuries he sustained when his plane went down and he was tortured during the Vietnam War. Trump’s conduct was not just typical of the way he has crushed every tradition of presidential decorum. It also offered a potential roadmap to the substance and character of his possible second term. At the same time, Trump’s weekend eruptions also show why he may be a compromised general-election candidate. They played directly into Biden’s claims that he’s too extreme and too morally challenged to be president again. And Trump’s latest outbursts are politically self-defeating: They took attention away from Biden’s frantic attempts at damage control following special counsel Robert Hur’s devastating assessment of Biden as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Much has been written about the new, disciplined Trump campaign. But the ex-president is reminding voters of his volatile first term, which included two impeachments. Biden struggles to parry increasing worries about his age The White House and Biden’s allies spent the weekend fighting back following a late Thursday news conference at which the president vented about Hur’s findings. The event may have exacerbated Biden’s political problems since he mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico, following several similar occasions last week when he referred to long-dead European leaders with whom he interacted in the 1980s rather their more recent successors. The acute political problem Biden faces was underscored by a new ABC News/Ipsos poll published Sunday in which 86% of Americans said Biden was too old to serve another term. The figure includes 59% of Americans who think both he and Trump are too old and 27% who think only Biden is too old. President Joe Biden speaks at the White House on February 8, 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Here’s Biden’s problem: It’s politically corrosive when a critical narrative takes hold about a president and subsequent events appear to validate it. Every flub or mistake the president makes — after a lifetime of verbal slips and gaffes — now plays into the perception that he’s losing his grip mentally. And his age is a political problem that can’t be fixed. The danger is that voters who see him onstage begin to find it impossible to get past and therefore don’t judge him on his successes as president, his program for a second term or the comparison between him and Trump. Multiple Democrats have attested to Biden’s mental acuity since Thursday. “I have seen the president twice in the last two weeks,” Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” The California lawmaker added: “I have had a conversation with him. He’s completely mentally sharp when we were discussing the Middle East.” But when Biden’s allies are forced to talk about his age, they inevitably draw attention back to the biggest liability for a president who polls show is struggling to create enthusiasm among grassroots Democrats and who may have trouble in reunifying his 2020 coalition, especially when it comes to younger and minority voters. Many Democrats also believe Trump is getting a pass when it comes to age and mental sharpness. While Biden’s missteps get great attention, Trump’s speeches often degenerate into nonsensical reflections. He recently mixed up Haley and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And while his manic presentation style may look energetic and disguise his age in comparison with Biden’s, he’d also be an octogenarian in the White House if he wins a second term. Why the 2020 election lineup may be locked in The renewed focus on Biden’s age is likely to open another round of speculation about whether he could be replaced on the Democratic ticket. But barring some unforeseen health event or a late decision by Biden to fold his campaign, this is highly unlikely. For all the focus on the president’s liabilities, no younger Democrat, with the exception of his long-shot primary rival Rep. Dean Phillips , has emerged to challenge Biden, perhaps to avoid damaging their own political futures. Could the Democratic Party pick an alternative candidate at its summer convention? It’s unlikely. Biden controls the infrastructure of the party — his rejigging of the primary calendar to insulate himself from challenges is proof of that. There’s no sign any major party figure is willing to tell him to step aside or to organize any attempt to topple him. Any convention maneuvering would also follow months of primaries in which Democratic voters are likely to massively endorse Biden, so any attempt to topple him would fly in the face of the democratic principles that Democrats say they are trying to preserve. Had Vice President Kamala Harris been a striking success, there would be more pressure on Biden to yield to a younger successor. But her approval ratings are very low. Haley, for instance, sees Harris as such a political liability that she warns voters they could vote for Biden and get Harris as president. The time for moving on from Trump has also passed. Despite his four indictments, the ex-president’s dominance over Haley and other rivals in early nominating contests has crushed the notion that if only he faced a one-on-one fight, he’d be defeated by anti-Trump forces in the party. So it’s hard to see any way out of the choice America appears not to want. While there are are stark policy differences between Biden and Trump, the 2024 election could still come down to voters picking between Biden’s perceived declining capabilities and Trump’s wild, anti-democratic and autocratic instincts."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/senate-democrats-biden-election-analysis/index.html,"CNN — For Senate Democrats, 2024 is the year of living dangerously. In this fall’s Senate elections, Democrats will be defending more seats in precarious political terrain than in any other election during the 2020s. That list of challenging elections this year includes the final three Senate seats Democrats hold in states that voted for Donald Trump in 2020, and five more in states that President Joe Biden won by 3 percentage points or less. Meanwhile, Republicans this year are not defending any Senate seats in states that voted against Trump in 2020, or preferred him by 3 points or less. That math underlines the stakes for Democrats in Biden improving his position in the key swing states by November. One of the most powerful trends of modern Senate elections is that it has become exceedingly difficult for candidates in either party to win seats in states that usually vote the other way for president. The Senate Democrats running in difficult electoral terrain might break that trend this fall. Yet if they can’t, Biden’s fate in November could determine control of the Senate not only in 2025, but for years thereafter. A strong recovery by Biden in which he wins most of the key swing states could position Democrats to remain competitive in the battle for Senate control through the remainder of this decade, even if they narrowly lose the majority in November. But if Biden loses most of the swing states, Democrats could fall into a Senate deficit too large to realistically overcome for years — especially because the party has so few plausible opportunities to flip seats now held by the GOP. “If the bottom were to drop out for Biden, Democrats could lose the Senate for a long time,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the political newsletter “Sabato’s Crystal Ball,” which is published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. That prospect has enormous implications not only for the passage of legislation but also for the composition of the federal courts, especially the Supreme Court. Four of the Supreme Court justices will be older than 70 by 2028. Even if Biden holds the White House in 2024, and a vacancy arises, a durable Republican Senate majority might refuse to fill any of those seats — just as then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did while Barack Obama was president in 2016. “You can imagine Supreme Court seats going unfilled for years,” Kondik said. The default position for the Senate in the 21st century has been for small and fleeting majorities. In the 12 congressional sessions since 2001, one party or the other has reached 55 Senate seats only three times. By comparison, one party or the other won a majority of 55 or more Senate seats seven times in the 10 sessions from 1980 to 2000. Smaller majorities, not surprisingly, have proved more difficult to defend: In this century, control of the Senate has already flipped in the elections of 2002, 2006, 2014 and 2020. The principal reason the chamber has become so closely divided is the growing correlation between how states vote for president and how they vote for the Senate. That has limited the number of Senate seats each side can win absent unusual circumstances. Through the late 20th century, it was common for voters to split their tickets by electing senators from one party while voting for the presidential nominee of the other. After the 1984 election, for instance, Democrats still held about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for Ronald Reagan in both of his winning presidential campaigns. But now the alignment between presidential and Senate outcomes has become nearly complete. Heading into the 2024 election, Republicans hold 47 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Trump in 2020. Democrats, in turn, hold 48 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Biden last time. This surface equivalence in the two parties’ position in the Senate, though, masks a deeper divergence that largely explains the risk to Democrats this year. While Biden and Trump each won 25 states in 2020, Biden won far more of them by very narrow margins. As a result, Senate Democrats are much more dependent than Republicans on states that lean their way only slightly in the presidential contest. In 2020, Biden won three states by less than a single percentage point: Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. He won three others by less than 3 percentage points: Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan. Democrats now hold 11 of the 12 Senate seats from those six highly competitive states. (Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is the only Republican senator from these states.) President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally in Las Vegas on February 4, 2024. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images By contrast, among the 25 states that backed Trump, North Carolina — where Republicans hold both Senate seats — was the only one Trump carried by less than 3 percentage points. Even extending the net to states Trump won by less than 5 percentage points brings in only Florida, where Republicans also hold both Senate seats. This contrast creates a huge disparity between the parties. Democrats now hold 14 inherently vulnerable Senate seats: their three from the states Trump won in 2020, and their 11 in the states Biden won only narrowly. For Republicans the total is at most six: two in states that Biden won in 2020, and four in states that Trump won narrowly, even with Florida included. “When you have so many states where it is now inconceivable that they could go the other way, Democrats always have to get a straight flush,” said Michael Podhorzer , the former political director for the AFL-CIO. “They’ve got to run the table, because on the basis of what’s safe on either side in the Senate, or the Electoral College, they are at a huge disadvantage.” This year Democrats are defending five of their 11 seats in the states that Biden won by 3 points or less. That’s the biggest concentration of seats from those states Democrats must defend in any single election in this decade, from 2020 through 2028. This year’s Senate races in the narrow Biden states include Democratic incumbents Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, and Jacky Rosen in Nevada; also on the ballot is an open Democratic-held seat in Michigan (where the party is very likely to nominate Rep. Elissa Slotkin) and the Arizona seat held by Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sinema hasn’t indicated whether she will seek reelection, but Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is already running for the seat. (Democrats also face an unexpected challenge in Maryland — a state that leans much more reliably toward them in presidential elections — after GOP former Gov. Larry Hogan last week said he would run for the open seat there.) In addition, Democrats this year must defend all three of their remaining Senate seats in the states that voted for Trump in 2020. That includes incumbents Jon Tester in Montana, Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and the open seat being vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin in West Virginia. Neither of the two remaining Senate Republicans in states that Biden won last time (Susan Collins in Maine and Johnson in Wisconsin) are up this year; nor are either of the GOP senators from North Carolina, the state Trump won by his smallest margin. Both parties agree the open West Virginia seat is virtually guaranteed to flip to the GOP. Tester and Brown both have strong personal brands, but Biden is almost certain to lose their states, and possibly by substantial margins. If he does, Brown and Tester could survive only by breaking a nearly inviolate recent pattern in presidential election years. In 2016, for the first time ever, every Senate race was won by the same party that carried the presidential contest in that state. In 2020, every Senate race again followed the presidential outcome — except in Maine, where Collins won reelection despite Biden’s victory there. This pattern proved especially frustrating to Democrats, who raised enormous sums in 2020 for Senate candidates in Republican-leaning states such as Kentucky, South Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Montana and Texas. Yet when Trump comfortably carried those states in November, all of those Democratic Senate candidates lost as well. A man votes on Election Day on November 3, 2020, in Charleston, South Carolina. Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images This year, with West Virginia likely already gone, if either Brown or Tester loses, it would be very difficult for Democrats to maintain their Senate majority into 2025. The only Republican senators they might plausibly oust to offset those losses are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas. Democrats have recruited strong challengers to each of them, but both of those races clearly lean toward the GOP, especially in a presidential election year. But if Democrats can hold down their Senate losses to some (or even all) of their three seats in the states Trump won in 2020, they would emerge with a deficit small enough to overcome in upcoming elections. The real long-term risk for the party this November is losing several of their Senate seats in the states Biden narrowly carried last time. (Hogan’s bid in Maryland adds a wild card, but the probability that Biden wins Maryland will likely leave Hogan as an underdog despite his personal popularity.) If Democrats lose Senate seats in the narrow Biden states, they simply have very few places on the map to replace them, given the parties’ patterns of support. It’s that prospect that has led the Democratic data analyst David Shor to warn for years that if the party doesn’t perform well in the 2024 presidential election, the GOP could seize control of the Senate for a sustained period. Shor would not comment on the Democrats’ Senate situation, but many other analysts see a dangerous convergence: The party must defend an unusually large number of seats in terrain that is highly contested at the presidential level precisely as Biden is struggling in polls against Trump. “There is a real downside risk that if the presidential election goes poorly, the Republicans could not only win the Senate but build something of a cushion that would be hard for Democrats to cut into in the near future,” Kondik said. Gene Ulm, a Republican pollster who has worked for many Senate candidates, agrees that what happens in the narrow Biden 2020 states this fall will cast a huge shadow on control of the Senate through the decade. If Republicans capture Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, he said, the reaction in the political world would not be “gosh, shock, alert the media,” he said. “It’s one thing for Republicans to recapture those states that have been habitually red,” Ulm said, but “if all of a sudden you have Republicans winning places that are historically purple,” that creates a very different situation going forward. The best-case scenario for Democrats is that Biden recovers enough to win most or all of the five battleground states where the party is also defending Senate seats. Many on both sides agree that it will be difficult for Republicans to flip any of those Democratic-held seats if Biden wins the state — with Arizona a possible exception if Sinema creates a three-way race. Of the Democrats running in the narrow Biden states, Casey in Pennsylvania and Baldwin in Wisconsin are probably best positioned to win even the president he loses their state, many in both parties agree. Brown and Tester also have deep roots that could allow them to survive Biden defeats as well. But in this era of greater party-line voting, it won’t be easy for any candidate to overcome such an undertow: Hardly any Senate Democrats in competitive races ran even 2 percentage points ahead of Biden’s vote share in 2020. Ulm sees two keys to the Senate outcomes in the competitive swing states. One is the choices in the Senate races by voters who back third-party presidential candidates out of distaste for both Biden and Trump, assuming they face each other again; it is very difficult at this point, Ulm said, to predict how those disaffected voters will vote in Senate (and House) races. For Ulm, the other key question is what happens with the voters who are slightly negative about Biden. He is confident Republican Senate candidates will romp among voters who strongly disapprove of Biden, as they did in 2022. But one reason Democrats blunted the anticipated 2022 red wave is their congressional and gubernatorial candidates ran unusually well among voters who only “somewhat disapproved” of Biden — largely because many of those voters considered the Trump-allied GOP alternatives too extreme. Electoral workers process ballots in Easton, Pennsylvania, on November 3, 2020. Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images That risk to the GOP remains. “The soft disapprovers are going to be a much more competitive constituency, just like 2022,” Ulm said. David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, notes that in the 2022 midterm election, Democrats won Senate races in most of these same battleground states, although exit polls showed substantial discontent with the economy and Biden’s performance then, too. “Senate campaigns are candidate versus candidate battles,” Bergstein said. “We have the superior candidates, and Republicans are putting forward candidates who have big flaws, who lost races before, or are facing the prospect of damaging primaries. Certainly a presidential cycle is different than a midterm, but the laws of Senate campaigns, where candidate quality matters, are still in effect.” Gary Jacobson, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of California at San Diego who specializes in Congress, said that given the fissures opening in each party’s coalition during the Trump era, no one should rule out the possibility that either side may develop new opportunities that reconfigure the Senate’s precarious balance. “This structural disadvantage the Democrats have is a real thing and it will make it an uphill battle for them to control the Senate for the foreseeable future,” Jacobson said. “But the foreseeable future is pretty short. Political configurations are not cut in stone.” Unless and until such a new political configuration emerges, both parties can realistically target many fewer Senate seats than they could even two decades ago. But the ceiling is clearly lower for Democrats than for Republicans. It leaves Democrats, even in good years, with achingly little margin for error to build a Senate majority. And unless Biden recovers more strength, 2024 may be very far from anything Democrats would call a good year."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/south-carolina-trump-haley-voters/index.html,"Pawleys Island, South Carolina CNN — Joy Rendulic was hesitant when her husband first suggested a move to South Carolina. Then she visited a small ice cream shop for sale near the spectacular coast of this barrier island town. Rendulic cashed in her 401(k) to buy it, and left Erie, Pennsylvania, behind. “God brought me here,” Rendulic told us during a break at Island Treats ice cream shop. “I thought I was doing what I was supposed to be doing for the rest of my life, and he had a different plan. We think we are in control. But we’re not.” The big move was in 2016. Nikki Haley was the governor then, and newcomer Rendulic was impressed. “Yes, she was a very good governor,” Rendulic said. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, in December 2023. Carlos Barria/Reuters/File Related article CNN Poll: Most Americans want verdict on Trump election subversion charges before 2024 vote Donald Trump won her vote for president that same year, again in 2020 and will once more when Trump and Haley square off in the South Carolina GOP presidential primary this month. “I totally believe that God has assigned him to this position,” Rendulic said of Trump.  “That is my true belief.” We ask what happened in 2020. “That was a mess,” Rendulic said. “That was so illegal. Some improper cheating happening to the voting procedures.” We mention all the recounts and court cases Trump lost, including cases decided by judges Trump appointed, that upheld now-President Joe Biden’s victory. “I think so many people hate Trump,” she said. “I just know there was a whole lot of cheating.” There is no evidence of that, but Rendulic is adamant. So we ask, if it was God’s plan for Trump to be president, why would God let that happen? The answer is halting. “What happened is what happened. And I believe Trump is coming again.” Rendulic represents an important slice of the Trump base: for Trump no matter what. These voters echo his false claims about rigged elections and bogus investigations and they stand by Trump even when he does things counter to their priorities. You find a lot of them in South Carolina, one reason Trump consistently leads the primary polls despite Haley’s home state status. Rendulic, for example, lists abortion – or the “right to life,” as she puts it – as the reason her last vote for a Democrat for president was Jimmy Carter. But she offers no criticism of Trump when we point out he has recently criticized some state abortion restrictions as too harsh and has warned it could be a losing issue for Republicans. “I haven’t thought about that too much, probably,” Rendulic said. “I want it to be right to life.” No doubt Trump gets her vote. “He’s even more ready now and very, very intelligent, cares a lot about this country,” she said. “Wants to do what is right.” Looking for a tough border ‘fix’ from Trump Billy Pierce is another piece of the Trump comeback puzzle. He has lived in Hartsville – about two hours inland from the South Carolina coast – all his 70 years except for a stint in the Navy. Pierce says he was drawn to Trump in 2016 for the same reason he backed Ross Perot in 1992. “I wanted a non-career politician in there that would do, would run it like a company,” Pierce said in an interview in the garage office where he organizes his part-time consulting work. Pierce sees Biden as too unwilling to stand up to the Democratic left and has fond memories of the pre-Covid economy during the Trump administration. “We didn’t have the high inflation,” he said. “We didn’t have the high interest rates.” Pierce is not an election denier. He does believe it was wrong that many states adopted new voting rules during the 2020 pandemic, but said Trump should have honored the results once all his challenges were exhausted. Nor is Pierce a fan of the former president’s toxic tone. “If he’d just shut up and, you know, got off Twitter and that kind of stuff, he’d have made a great president,” Pierce said. He called himself a likely Trump voter in the primary and described the choice between Trump and Haley as “the lesser of two evils.” Billy Pierce talks to John King in Hartsville, South Carolina. CNN But Pierce is very much in line with Trump on policy matters. “He’s going to fix the things I need him to fix,” Pierce said, listing the border as his top priority. “Shut it down,” is Pierce’s desire, though he agrees with Trump that congressional Republicans should not pass a border package before the November election – even if it would slow the flow of illegal border crossings. “This is a Democratic ploy” designed to help Biden, Pierce said. He offers a suggestion on what he would do at the border, based on his time in the military. “Have us put up razor wire,” Pierce said. “I have no problem with putting up two rows and mining the other. So if they come in, you tell them it is mined. You put signs out there that says it’s mined.” He balances such tough talk with a personal story about his daughter adopting two children from Guatemala. Be tough at the border now, Pierce said, and then conversations about more legal immigration would be possible. “It needs to be done the right way.” From sending a message to DC to sending a message to the next generation Craig Thomas lived in Tennessee when Trump caught his attention in 2016. Thomas describes himself as “conservative, some areas libertarian.” Trump, he thought then, was an outsider – and a vote for him would send a message to Washington. “It was like, alright, like this is good,” said Thomas. “Let’s blow some things up.” Now, Thomas lives in Charleston and is voting for Haley – to send a message to his two children. Craig Thomas talks to John King in Charleston, South Carolina. CNN He is tired of all the personal attacks and all the anger and wants a president who is also a role model. Haley, he said, “brings very similar policy positions, but definitely without the drama.” One recent MAGA conspiracy theory hit too close to home. “I don’t think there’s any sort of a crazy conspiracy between the NFL and Taylor Swift and everything else just showing up for a Biden coronation,” Thomas said. “How do I look at my daughter, who is a huge Taylor Swift fan, and this guy just attacking Taylor Swift, just because she is going to support another candidate, right.” “And other things like that. And having those conversations with them. It does matter. And it does matter who you support.” Trump as a religion Charleston is rich with both Revolutionary and Civil War history, a place where you can still ride a horse-drawn carriage down a cobblestone street. It is more affluent, more educated and less Trumpy than most of South Carolina. “But there is quite a bit of talk about Trump, even here,” Thomas said. Mark Sanford is out of politics because of that – because of the reach of the Trump Republican revolution. Sanford served in the House representing a Charleston-area district, and then was the state’s two-term Republican governor just before Haley was first elected in 2010. Sanford won his old House seat back in 2013, but then lost the Republican primary in 2018 because he was a sharp critic of then-President Trump’s fiscal policies, and sometimes of his tone. “I would say, ‘Well I’m for Trump in this area, but I’m against in these different areas.’ But people didn’t want nuance. They want: ‘Are you for or against him.’” Sanford wouldn’t directly answer when asked how he will vote in this month’s primary. But he did offer this: “I’ve never voted for Trump so far. I know that I’m not voting for him this time. I’ll let you read the tea leaves from that.” John King talks to Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman from the Charleston area. CNN Sanford agrees when Haley goes after Trump for all the “chaos,” and especially when she highlights the deficit spending of the Trump years. Yet he expects a big Trump win in South Carolina, because the GOP electorate is so different now from when he was first elected. “What has traditionally worked in GOP politics isn’t so much working these days,” he said in an interview at his home in the Charleston suburb of Mount Pleasant. “He became sort of a proxy litmus test for ‘Are you for or against the system,’” Sanford said. “I’ve seen this erosion,” Sanford said. “Sort of Perot movement to Tea Party to Trump. It’s metastasized in ever aggressive forms. And what started out as a lot of well meaning Americans saying, ‘Look, we’ve got to do something about politicians doing what they said they were going to do’ (has evolved) into something much more strident. … It is their religion. I mean, I, I don’t know how else to explain it.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/fact-check-trump-new-york-hush-money/index.html,"Washington CNN — Former President Donald Trump , now the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, made false and evidence-free claims to reporters on Thursday before and after he attended a Manhattan court hearing in the hush money criminal case against him. Here is a fact check of some of Trump’s remarks. Trump’s court attendance and campaign schedule Before entering the courtroom, Trump claimed that the hush money case against him is “election interference.” He also argued that it is literally interfering with his ability to campaign in South Carolina in advance of the February 24 Republican presidential primary there. “How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again – this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said. Trump was even more explicit in comments after leaving the courtroom later in the morning, saying, “So instead of being in South Carolina and other states, campaigning, I’m stuck here.” Facts First : Trump wasn’t “stuck” in the courthouse in New York on Thursday. In fact, he was not required to attend any part of the hearing, since Judge Juan Merchan had waived his pretrial appearances in the hush money case . Rather, Trump voluntarily chose to appear at the hearing after considering instead attending a Thursday hearing in Georgia that is related to the charges he faces there . And he had not been scheduled to be in South Carolina on Thursday even before he made the decision to attend the New York hearing; his next scheduled campaign appearance in the state is next week. His next rally after the Thursday hearing is a Saturday event in Michigan . Trump was not planning to fly to South Carolina after the New York hearing. He was planning to fly back to Florida, where he lives. Though he has appeared only occasionally at court hearings, Trump has spent little time campaigning in South Carolina so far in the 2024 campaign. His two rallies in the state in the past week were his first there in 2024 . Biden and the hush money case Before entering the courtroom, Trump claimed that President Joe Biden’s White House is running the hush money case that was brought against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg . “What it is, is election interference. It’s being run by Joe Biden’s White House. His top person was placed here in order to make sure everything goes right,” Trump said. He continued, “His top person, Colangelo, and some others have been placed into the DA’s office to make sure they do a good job of election interference.” Facts First: There is no basis for Trump’s claims. First, there is no evidence that Biden’s White House has any role in running the Manhattan district attorney’s case. Second, there is no evidence that the White House nor the Biden administration had anything to do with senior Justice Department official Matthew Colangelo’s decision to leave the department and join the district attorney’s office in 2022 as senior counsel to Bragg . Colangelo and Bragg knew each other before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney. Colangelo and Bragg previously worked at the same time in the office of New York’s state attorney general, where Colangelo investigated Trump’s charity and Trump’s financial practices and was involved in bringing various lawsuits against the Trump administration. On a minor point, Colangelo was never Biden’s very top official at the Justice Department. Colangelo served as acting associate attorney general in the first months of the Biden administration in early 2021 and then as principal deputy associate attorney general. As acting associate attorney general, he was third in command of the department. Justice Department prosecutors declined both in the middle and at the end of Trump’s presidential term to pursue federal charges against Trump over the hush money case, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig reported in a 2023 book . Honig reported that federal prosecutors in New York decided against pursuing charges in 2018 on account of longstanding Justice Department guidance that a sitting president can’t be indicted. Honig reported that in January 2021, just before Trump left office that month, federal prosecutors in New York held discussions about possibly reviving the case but again decided not to seek an indictment. Violent crime in New York Before entering the courtroom Trump denounced the hush money case against him and said, “This is not a crime. And when you look what’s going on outside [inaudible; in or on] the streets, where violent crime is at an all-time high, I think it’s a very, very – it’s a great double standard.” Trump has made similar claims about crime levels in New York City on various previous occasions while attacking the cases he faces in New York – and CNN has repeatedly debunked them. Facts First : Trump’s claim remains false. Violent crime is nowhere near a record high in either Manhattan in particular or New York City as a whole. Both Manhattan and New York City have experienced massive declines in crime since the record levels of the early 1990s. New York City publishes crime statistics on its website, so the facts are easy to find. In 1990, when the city set its all-time record for murders, there were 503 recorded murders in Manhattan, which is one of the city’s five boroughs. In 2023, Manhattan recorded 73 murders – a decline of about 85% from 1990. Manhattan is also way below record levels for other kinds of violent crime. For example, Manhattan recorded 252 rapes in 2023, down about 63% from the 689 in 1990, and 3,841 robberies in 2023, down about 86% from the 26,907 in 1990. The declines are similarly large for New York City as a whole . The city recorded 391 murders in 2023, down about 83% from the 2,262 in 1990; 1,455 rapes in 2023, down about 53% from the 3,126 in 1990; and 16,910 robberies in 2023, down about 83% from the 100,280 in 1990."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/fact-check-trump-nato/index.html,"Washington CNN — For a third straight presidential election campaign, former President Donald Trump is being serially inaccurate about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance. Trump caused a transatlantic uproar this weekend by claiming at a Saturday campaign rally that he had once told the president of a “big” NATO country that if that country didn’t pay its “bills,” he would not protect the country from a Russian invasion and would even “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want.” Trump’s incendiary remarks contained a familiar false claim. His assertion about NATO allies supposedly having failed to pay “bills” is not true, as fact-checkers at CNN and elsewhere have pointed out for years. And Trump has for years made a variety of other false claims about spending by NATO and its members. Here is a fact check of five of his repeated statements. Spending by NATO members Trump has long claimed that various NATO members have failed to pay their “ bills ,” “ dues ” or “ NATO fees ,” that they “ owe us a tremendous amount of money ” or that they “ owe NATO billions of dollars .” Facts First: All of these Trump claims are false. While a majority of NATO members do not meet the alliance’s target of each member spending a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, the 2% target is a “guideline ” that does not create bills, debts or legal obligations if it is not met. In fact, the guideline doesn’t require payments to NATO or the US at all. Rather, it simply requires each country to spend on their own defense programs. When Trump was president, the guideline was written in forgiving language that made clear that it was not a firm commitment. That version of the guideline, created at a NATO summit in Wales in 2014, said members that had yet to reach 2% would “aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade with a view to meeting their NATO Capability Targets and filling NATO’s capability shortfalls.” In other words, the members that were below 2% in 2014 didn’t even have to promise to hit the target by 2024 – simply to make an effort to do so by then. NATO does require members to make direct contributions to fund the organization’s own operations. But there is no sign that members have failed to make those contributions, which constitute a tiny fraction of the allies’ defense spending, and Trump has made clear that his talk of debts  is about the 2% guideline. Stephen Saideman , the Paterson Chair in International Affairs at Carleton University in Canada, said in a Monday email that the word “inaccurate really does not cover Trump’s protection racket/country club perception of dues owed to the US.” “The money, as you and everyone else knows, is not sent from member states to the US or NATO (although there is a common fund that pays for the buildings in Brussels and elsewhere but it is not that much money and is not the focus of the 2% discussions). The commitment is for each country to spend enough on their own militaries – 2% of GDP, 20% of defense spending on equipment – so that the alliance as a whole is capable and can credibly deter Russia and do whatever else the alliance agrees to,” Saideman said. As of 2023, 11 of 30 NATO members were meeting the 2% target, NATO estimates show . That was up from three members in 2014. Erwan Lagadec , a research professor at George Washington University’s ﻿Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, noted in a Monday email that NATO members agreed to firmer language related to the 2% target in 2023, formally declaring that “we make an enduring commitment to invest at least 2% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually on defence.” Lagadec said that “arguably for the first time the Allies HAVE made a hard commitment to reaching 2% (indeed, to reaching at least 2%) rather than merely ‘trying to get there if possible.’” He noted, though, that even this stronger declaration “doesn’t provide a deadline” to hit 2%. Regardless, it will not create actual debts to the US or NATO. NATO members’ spending before Trump took office As president, Trump claimed that NATO members’ spending had declined “every single year” until he took office in 2017. He sometimes claimed there had been 15 , 16 or 18 years of declines. Facts First : Trump’s claims that NATO members’ spending had declined every year until he took office are false. Official NATO data show that non-US members’ defense spending increased in each of the two years prior to Trump’s presidency – by 1.6% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016. The increases came after NATO members recommitted to the 2%-of-GDP guideline at the 2014 summit in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region . Non-US members’ defense spending increases in each year of the Trump era were bigger than their increases in 2015 and 2016 – the increases were 5.9% in 2017, 4.3% in 2018, 3.6% in 2019 and 4.6% in 2020 – and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg gave Trump at least partial credit . But Trump is wrong when he claims he reversed a downward trend. “If you look at the year-on-year data, the turning point away from the nadir of European defense spending happened in 2014, pre-Trump, and clearly due to Crimea,” Lagadec said. Saideman said that while it’s possible he is undervaluing Trump’s impact because he generally dislikes Trump, “Putin deserves most of the credit for defense spending increases in Europe.” He said, “Everyone was cutting their defense budgets after the 2008 economic crisis and as countries started pulling out of Afghanistan, and all that changed with the seizure of Crimea.” And he argued that any increases sparked by Trump are likely less about his efforts to cajole allies than about those allies’ concerns about the US no longer keeping its commitments given what has sounded from Trump like “genuine hostility to the alliance and to the allies.” Under President Joe Biden, non-US NATO members increased their defense spending by 2.8% in 2021 and an estimated 2.0% in 2022, then by an estimated 8.3% in 2023. That large 2023 spike was “clearly in reaction to the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine” in 2022, Lagadec said. The US share of NATO spending As president, Trump repeatedly claimed that, before him, the US was “ paying for 100% of NATO ” or “ paying close to 100% .” Facts First : Trump’s claims are false. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members – a large majority, but not “100%” or “close to 100%.” And Trump’s claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover NATO’s organizational expenses and are set based on each country’s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016 . The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 68% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany; Lagadec said the US share was reduced from 22% “to placate Trump” and is a “sweetheart deal” given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance’s total GDP . What previous presidents told NATO members As president, Trump repeatedly claimed that before he pressured NATO members to increase their defense spending, US presidents did not even ask them to do so. He singled out former President Barack Obama in his comments at the rally on Saturday. After referring to NATO members Trump said he pressured himself, he continued: “And then I hear that they like Obama better. They should like Obama better. You know why? Because he didn’t ask for anything.” Facts First : Trump’s claims are false. Both Obama and his predecessor, President George W. Bush , repeatedly pressed other NATO members to spend more on defense, though t heir public language was less confrontational than Trump’s. At a news conference in Belgium in 2014, Obama said , “ If we’ve got collective defense, it means that everybody has got to chip in. And I have had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO – not all, but many. The trend lines have been going down.” In a speech in Germany in 2016, Obama said , “Every NATO member should be contributing its full share – 2% of GDP – towards our common security, something that doesn’t always happen. And I’ll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense.” In a speech to Canada’s Parliament in 2016, he said , “As your ally and as your friend, let me say that we’ll be more secure when every NATO member, including Canada, contributes its full share to our common security.” In a speech in the Czech Republic in 2002, before a NATO summit, Bush said that every NATO member needs to make a military contribution to the alliance, and “f or some allies, this will require higher defense spending.” Bush and top administration officials continued for the rest of his presidency to push for increased spending. While visiting Romania in 2008, Bush said , “Building a strong NATO alliance also requires a strong European defense capacity. So at this summit, I will encourage our European partners to increase their defense investments to support both NATO and EU operations.” The cost of NATO’s headquarters While criticizing NATO both during and after his presidency, Trump has claimed that NATO spent $3 billion on its headquarters building in Belgium. Facts First: Trump’s $3 billion figure is not close to accurate. NATO told CNN in 2020 that the headquarters building was constructed for a sum under the approved budget of 1.178 billion euro, or about $1.27 billion at Monday exchange rates – certainly an expensive facility, but less than half what Trump has claimed."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/politics/kfile-whatley-promoted-false-election-fraud-claims/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump and his allies are pushing to replace the chair of the Republican National Committee with North Carolina’s party leader who promoted 2020 presidential election lies and supported using the courts to overturn the results. Michael Whatley, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, shared false claims that Republican observers were prevented from accessing polling locations and repeatedly said Democratic cities in swing states were engaged in “massive fraud,” a CNN KFile review of Whatley’s comments following the election found. Whatley, who has since acknowledged Joe Biden is the country’s legitimate president, currently serves as general counsel at the RNC overseeing litigation and what the organization calls its “election integrity” efforts. His elevation to RNC chair could give Trump a loyalist more willing to devote resources to pursue future voter fraud claims in court should they arise. One reason why Trump soured on Ronna McDaniel, the current chair, was his perception she should have done more to fight for his candidacy in 2020, CNN reported. Like many Republicans, Whatley publicly backed Trump’s voter fraud claims on multiple occasions following the 2020 election. “Regardless of how these lawsuits come out around the country with the presidential race we do know that there was massive fraud that took place,” Whatley said in one late November 2020 interview on local North Carolina radio. “We know that it took place in places like Milwaukee and Detroit and Philadelphia.” There is no evidence of massive fraud in any of those cities or around the country as Republican election officials and Trump-appointed former Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged . Trump and his supporters filed more than 60 cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one. Whatley, a former Senate staffer and one-time lobbyist focused on energy-related issues, said in a statement to CNN he believed pandemic related changes to voting laws weakened safeguards against voter fraud. “There is no question that changes to the 2020 election process which weakened safeguards on absentee and mail-in votes in some states led to distrust by many across the Country. I firmly believe in having proper safeguards in place to ensure that it is easy to vote and hard to cheat.“ Whatley is one of two candidates Trump and his allies are supporting to take over the RNC. The other is Drew McKissick, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. Trump turned on McDaniel over the poor finances and management of the RNC at a time when the organization is facing one of its worst fundraising years in a decade. CNN reported Tuesday that McDaniel is planning to step down at the end of the month. Despite Trump’s preferred picks, only RNC members can choose to elect the new chairman. False claims about the 2020 election In his capacity as chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party in the days following the 2020 election, Whatley parroted much of Trump’s false election claims. One day before the election was called for Biden, Whatley echoed false claims about Republican poll watchers being barred from observation. “There’s also issues [in] surrounding states like Michigan and Pennsylvania where they’re not allowing Republican observers into the polling location to watch the voting,” Whatley said. “When we have instances of voter fraud, then obviously if those are widespread enough to be able to, you know, affect the outcome, you’re gonna have litigation that’s gonna deal with those.” One week following the 2020 election, Whatley called it alarming that the results would be determined in court but said it was the strategy needed for Trump to secure victory. At the time, there were recounts occurring in major swing states – all of which would affirm Biden’s victory. “I think that what we’re seeing in Georgia, especially with the hand recount,” he said on local North Carolina radio . “What we’re seeing in Arizona where we’re gonna have a recount out there as well – And then it’s gonna basically put states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin into court. It really is kind of scary proposition to think that you’re gonna have a court overturn some of those results. But that’s really the plan.” “And I get asked every single day by a reporter, why do you keep alleging that there’s fraud out there?” he continued. “And it’s like, all you have to do is look at the stories that we’re seeing out of Philadelphia, the Detroit area, we’re seeing out of Milwaukee, egregious violations of election law. And there’s no question why it puts these elections at risk.” At the time, Trump and his allies were inundating the public with unfounded allegations of fraud in Democratic cities. They made baseless claims of excluded poll watchers, fake reports of suitcases filled with fraudulent ballots, bogus allegations of bussed-in ballots from New York to swing states and false assertions that Philadelphia had more ballots than voters. Whatley pointed to the contested 2000 presidential election recount in Florida, where he served on the Bush recount team during the legal disputes between George W. Bush and Al Gore, to argue the election was far from over. Ultimately, the Supreme Court intervened and stopped the recount, effectively deciding the election in Bush’s favor. “We’re not done in the presidential. We’re not done at all,” he added, referring to the 2020 election, in the interview. Condemned January 6th - but suggested not done by “Republican voters” In an interview on January 2, 2021, Whatley resigned himself to Biden being President – but said objections to the election were important to discuss the claims of fraud. “I think the fact that we’re likely to have the outcome be that Joe Biden is going to get certified and sworn in, does not mean that these protests are irrelevant,” he said . “It is absolutely critical that we have a national dialogue on election integrity. What we saw in places like Milwaukee and Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Phoenix is really very, very troubling.” Following the riot on January 6, 2021, Whatley condemned those who broke into the Capitol building in interviews. “The actions of these violent protestors is completely unjustified and unacceptable. There is no rationale to excuse this assault on the foundations of our Democracy,” he said in a tweet since deleted. In an interview, Whatley described himself as “appalled” by January 6th riot, but said the Republican Party as “a whole” was not “complicit” in what happened. “Most of the people that have been arrested were not necessarily Republican voters,” Whatley said in February 2021. “There’s certainly Trump supporters in there, but we’ve also seen others and we’re gonna unequivocally condemn those actions. In the aftermath of the January 6th some have sought to deflect blame for the riot by alleging Republican partisans weren’t the primarily force behind it, though subsequent investigations have shown that those arrested were mostly Trump supporters. In another interview in February 2021 , Whatley acknowledged Biden as “legitimately” elected President of the United States. “I was a member of the Electoral College, and I proudly cast my vote for President Trump. But the Electoral college voted. And a majority was for Joe Biden and he is the President of the United.” Following Biden’s inauguration, Whatley attacked the impeachment of former President Trump and in March referred to the Republican Party as “Donald Trump’s party,” at a local event."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — As the two-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, it feels like everyone has been sucked into a bizarro world. ► Two years ago, in February 2022, Tucker Carlson was a Fox News host, still adjacent to mainstream US politics. ► US support for Ukraine seemed ironclad and unflappable as Russia invaded. ► Russian President Vladimir Putin was about to be isolated worldwide as a pariah. ► Elon Musk would soon commit to helping Ukraine with his Starlink satellite internet system. ► Former President Donald Trump was still plotting his way out of the political wilderness, his presence rarely felt by most of the country. What a difference two years makes Some developments this week: ► Putin got a platform, thanks to a softball interview by Carlson, who was banished from Fox News last year and has turned to Twitter, the platform Musk bought and renamed X, to spew right-wing conspiracy theories. ► American aid for Ukraine is in real question as US politicians, led by Republicans in the House of Representatives, question the investment. Note: When Trump helped kill a bipartisan border policy bill this week, it also put Ukraine aid sought for months by President Joe Biden in jeopardy. ► Trump’s emergence from the wilderness is complete. He has all but erased any question he will be the Republican presidential nominee for the third time and is plotting his return to the White House. The Pentagon, by the way, is now paying Musk’s SpaceX for Ukraine to use Starlink. Video Ad Feedback Russia expert says this is what Putin hoped to get from Carlson interview 02:06 - Source: CNN A propaganda broadcast on X Carlson was walked on by Putin during the interview in Moscow. CNN’s Oliver Darcy called it a “propaganda victory” for Putin. From Darcy: Instead of pressing Putin on the many topics at hand, including credible accusations Russia has committed war crimes and the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Carlson allowed the autocrat a free lane to manipulate the public and tell his version of history, no matter how deceptive it may have been. At times, between the airing of grievances, Putin appeared to school Carlson on historical events as the host looked on in bewilderment. Or to put it more plainly, Carlson provided Putin a platform to spread his propaganda to a global audience with little to no scrutiny of his claims. In one notable exchange, Carlson did push back on the idea that Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia since last March, is a US spy. According to CNN’s reporting, Russia rejected an offer to exchange a large number of Russian nationals detained abroad for both Gershkovich and another American, Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since 2018. Putin told Carlson that perhaps Gershkovich could be exchanged for Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel in Russia’s domestic spying service who was convicted for murdering a former Chechen fighter in Berlin in broad daylight in 2019. CNN’s Nathan Hodge, Katharina Krebs and Helen Regan have more details . They also fact-check Carlson on his assertion that US media organizations have not tried to interview Putin. From their report: In fact, journalists have repeatedly been requesting interviews with Putin, but the Russian president had declined to grant access. And Putin not only has declined to participate in interviews with the free press, but over the past two years he has waged a war against the media, locking up journalists , fining Big Tech companies for hosting “fake” information about the Ukraine invasion, and pushing through censorship laws that clamp down on news organizations. Video Ad Feedback Amanpour pushes back on Tucker Carlson's claim about Putin interview 02:13 - Source: CNN Putin, despite the free platform from Carlson, still faces isolation in the West. The CNN reporters note the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin regarding an alleged scheme to take Ukrainian children to Russia. And there was a new call Thursday for Putin to face a war crimes inquiry for Russia’s assault on the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which killed thousands. The reporters also used the word “revanchist,” which I had to look up and which perfectly describes Putin’s warped view of history and his obsession with occupying Ukraine. From Merriam-Webster: (re·​vanch·​ist) of or relating to a policy designed to recover lost territory or status. Shakeup in Ukraine Meantime, there are major developments in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky this week replaced his top military commander, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. From CNN’s report : The president’s move follows tensions between Zelensky and his hugely popular military chief after the failure of Ukraine’s much-vaunted counteroffensive, and with Ukraine facing a renewed Russian onslaught, manpower and ammunition shortages, and US aid stalled in Congress. Major choices for Americans But among the many, concrete choices Americans face in November, assuming the presidential election is between Trump and Biden, is how the US president will approach Putin. Biden has his built his presidency around the idea of a worldwide struggle between democracies and autocracies. Trump frequently expresses admiration for autocrats and his frustration with democratic alliances like NATO. Ukraine funding has run dry The Pentagon has essentially exhausted the money Congress allocated for Ukraine over the past two years. It’s unclear when more might be on the way, particularly after the proposal to tie US border policy to Ukraine funding met its end this week. In the Senate, there is support for Ukraine aid. A bipartisan group of senators on Thursday cleared a 60-vote threshold to move toward a $95 billion aid bill for Ukraine and Israel. One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, plans to use arcane procedural tactics to stall a final vote for days . Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, pushed back against criticism from right-wing lawmakers that the money is charity for Ukraine. Most of the funds would be spent on production of military hardware in the US, he said. “This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy and demonstrating to our allies and adversaries alike that we’re serious about exercising American strength,” he said on the Senate floor on Friday. The House is a more formidable roadblock to additional Ukraine funding. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has not ruled out the idea of approving a Ukraine bill, either as a stand-alone proposition or in conjunction with aid to Israel. But he has certainly not endorsed it either. Johnson, along with other Republicans, has demanded more transparency and accountability for how the money is spent. And to get more aid passed into law, he would likely need Democratic votes – which will anger hard-line Republicans who have the power to oust him."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/haley-voters-trump-gop-biden-analysis/index.html,"CNN — As the South Carolina Republican primary approaches, the evidence is growing that Nikki Haley’s coalition is almost certainly not large enough to deny Donald Trump the GOP presidential nomination. But evidence is also accumulating that her coalition is more than large enough to deny Trump the White House in a general election if her voters remain as alienated from him as they now say they are. Story highlights Haley is exposing fault lines in the GOP coalition Her coalition doesn't appear to be enough to stop Trump from winning the nomination But her supporters present an opportunity for Biden to peel off crossover voters in a possible rematch with Trump The support for Haley in the early GOP contests has mapped, probably more precisely than ever before, the segments of the Republican electorate most deeply disaffected with Trump. In a possible rematch with Trump this fall, President Joe Biden will likely need to attract crossover support from a significant share of those ordinarily Republican-leaning voters to overcome the towering discontent evident in polls about his own performance. So far, most polls show Biden making only very limited inroads in a general election against Trump with the kind of GOP primary voters displaying the most support for Haley – a universe centered on college-educated, ideologically centrist, and Republican-leaning independent voters. But surveys of voters participating in the Iowa and New Hampshire nominating contests show that most Haley supporters express deeply negative views about Trump. That could provide Biden an opening for greater gains in the months ahead – if he can resolve, or even temper, more of those voters’ doubts about his own record, age and strength. “If there’s anything that should be sending warning flares up in the sky for the Trump people, this is it,” said Ace Smith, a California-based Democratic strategist, referring to the large number of Haley voters expressing negative views of the former president in polls. Long-time GOP strategist Michael Madrid, who advised the anti-Trump Lincoln Project in 2020, said the evidence of the early Republican results, and polls of GOP voters nationwide about the Trump-Haley contest, are sending the party a clear, but dual, message. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, in December 2023. Carlos Barria/Reuters/File Related article CNN Poll: Most Americans want verdict on Trump election subversion charges before 2024 vote On the one hand, Madrid said, all of these signals show “there’s not a lane for anyone else to get the nomination: This is Trump’s party.” But the same evidence, Madrid said, shows “Trump is entering this race significantly weaker with the Republican base than at any time since he secured the nomination in 2016.” The first stages of the battle for the 2024 GOP nomination have largely confirmed the party’s divided attitudes about Trump, which have been seen in national surveys over the past several years. Depending on the question, somewhere between one-fifth and one-third of self-identified GOP partisans have consistently expressed negative views in polls about Trump, particularly regarding his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection and his broader effort to overturn the 2020 election result. For instance, in a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland national survey , between 19% to 23% of Republicans and independents who lean toward the party agreed that Trump bore significant responsibility for the January 6 riot; that Trump “threatened democracy” when he told his supporters to march on the Capitol that day; that he was likely guilty of the criminal charges against him for attempting to overturn the 2020 election; and that the January 6 assault “was an attack on democracy that should never be forgotten.” Likewise, in a recent CBS poll released on the third anniversary of January 6 , about one-fourth of Republicans said they would describe the attack on the Capitol as an insurrection and an attempt to overthrow the US government. Roughly 3-in-10 Republicans said Biden had legitimately won the 2020 election and about one-third opposed pardons for the January 6 rioters, which Trump has signaled he will offer if elected to another term. More broadly, in the latest CNN national poll conducted by SSRS , just under one-fourth of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents said they viewed Trump unfavorably. Almost exactly the same share said the party would have a better chance to win in November with a nominee other than Trump . In a national NBC News poll released Sunday , 22% of GOP primary voters agreed that “the Republican Party needs a new leader with better personal behavior and a different approach” than Trump, while another 14% said “Donald Trump was a good president, but it is time to consider other leaders.” Across all of these questions, the share of Republican-leaning voters expressing negative views about Trump does not nearly approach a majority of the party. That explains why Haley faces such a steep uphill climb against him for the nomination, even though she has finally achieved the one-on-one race against Trump that his Republican critics have sought since 2016. Yet through Iowa and New Hampshire, despite not winning those contests, the former South Carolina governor has demonstrated that the minority of the party that has long expressed anti-Trump views in polls can be mobilized into a coherent coalition of resistance to him at the ballot box. And at a time when the nation is divided so closely between Republicans and Democrats, defection from even such a minority faction in his own camp could be difficult for Trump to overcome in a general election should he advance that far.

In Iowa, the voters resisting Trump split between Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has since dropped out; in New Hampshire they consolidated around Haley as the sole remaining alternative. But in each case, the GOP voters rejecting Trump have displayed similar demographic and ideological characteristics, according to the entrance and exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. In each state, Trump showed significantly less strength among voters with a college degree than those without one and much less strength among independents who voted than partisan Republicans. He also lagged among voters who identify as somewhat conservative or moderate compared to those who called themselves “very conservative” and did not run as well among those who do not identify as evangelical Christians as those who do. “This is not a casual vote, it’s a really thought-out vote,” said Celinda Lake, a long-time Democratic pollster who advised Biden’s 2020 campaign. “It has a whole schema around it – views about policy, views about temperament, about the criminal cases. It’s a very integrated view [about Trump].” In the two kick-off contests, Haley voters in particular expressed strikingly negative views about Trump and his assertions about the 2020 election. In the entrance poll conducted of GOP caucusgoers in Iowa, almost exactly 4-in-5 Haley voters said Trump would not be fit to serve as president again if convicted of a crime, according to results provided by CNN’s polling unit; likewise 4-in-5 Haley Iowa voters said Biden had legitimately won the 2020 election. In New Hampshire, more than 4-in-5 Haley voters said Trump would not be fit to serve again if convicted and that Biden had legitimately won. Fully 85% of Haley supporters said they would be dissatisfied if Trump were the nominee. The AP/NORC VoteCast poll offered similar warning signs for Trump. In that poll, two-thirds of Haley voters in Iowa said they would not vote for Trump in a general election; that number soared past three-fourths of her voters in New Hampshire. The Washington Post/Monmouth University poll of GOP voters in South Carolina released last week showed Trump opening a resounding 26 percentage point lead over Haley in her home state, which will hold its critical GOP primary on February 24. Yet the survey also raised the same general election red flags for Trump as the Edison surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Morry Gash/Pool/Getty Images/File Related article A Biden-Trump rematch would be mostly about Trump In the South Carolina poll, roughly three-fourths of those voting for Haley said they viewed Trump unfavorably; over three-fourths said Biden legitimately won in 2020; nearly three-fifths said Trump committed a crime in his response to that result; and less than one-in-five said they planned to vote for Trump in November. Smith said that the resistance to Trump surfacing in these early GOP primary polls will be “a huge, huge problem” for him in the general election. Two factors largely explain it, he believes: hostility to Trump’s role in overturning the nationwide legal right to abortion, which the US Supreme Court did in 2022, “plus people just not wanting the craziness and the chaos.” Madrid said the cumulative evidence from the early election results and these surveys indicates that the component of the GOP coalition dubious of Trump is larger than most people have thought – and likely larger than at any point since he first emerged as the party’s nominee in 2016. The Republicans critical of Trump were so isolated that “we used to be on one group chat and now we are running out of muskets to hand out to be in the conflict,” Madrid said. “I think everybody you talk to will all say the same thing: something has shifted. [Haley] is becoming the rallying cry for something different and something bigger, and that tells me that the swamp fever has broken with a wide part of the Republican Party.” Madrid estimates that the share of ordinarily Republican-leaning voters fundamentally disaffected with Trump has grown from around 6%-8% in 2020 to as much as nearly 20% now. Still, experts in both parties agree that many of the Haley primary voters now saying they would not support Trump in November would eventually fall into line behind him if he becomes the nominee. Haley herself, of course, has said that if she loses the nomination she would vote for Trump over Biden “any day of the week.” Jennifer Horn, a former New Hampshire Republican party chair who has become a fierce Trump critic, said, “I don’t think that whole 30%” or so of GOP voters coalescing behind Haley in the early states “goes to Biden because amongst that 30% are folks that are very loyal Republicans. They might not be loyal MAGA … but we know there are people out there who simply won’t vote for a Democrat.” The key “question for Biden,” she added, “is how many of the others can he win over?” Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump’s 2024 campaign, said that Trump would suffer minimal defections in the GOP coalition in a rematch with Biden because Republican voters believe Trump’s presidency produced far better results on the issues they care about than the current administration. “As long as they think Joe Biden is a really bad president, [Trump] will still keep those” voters now flocking to Haley, McLaughlin said. “They will be voting their self-interest. They are voting their pocketbooks, the border, crime and safety. They are voting war and peace. We always say the presidential race is decided by the two p’s: peace and prosperity. And on those ‘two p’s’ they look at Donald Trump and say, he did a better job.” The CNN national poll released last week suggests that many of the Republicans skeptical of Trump are indeed making that calculation. In a hypothetical matchup against the former president, the survey found Biden winning just 6% of GOP partisans and independents who leaned toward the party – far fewer than the 23% of those voters who expressed an unfavorable view of Trump. One key reason: fully 93% of all GOP-leaning voters said they disapproved of Biden’s performance as president. Similarly, in the new national NBC poll, just 8% of all GOP primary voters said they plan to vote for Biden in the general election – far fewer than the more than one-third in the survey who said they wanted the party to move beyond Trump. “I just don’t think there’s some significant possibility of [the] people telling AP VoteCast or the Exit Poll they are Republican not voting for Trump,” despite what they say now, veteran GOP pollster Bill McInturff – whose firm conducts the NBC survey with a Democratic partner – said in an email. Lake agrees the Republican disaffection surfacing in the primaries is so far translating more into hesitance about Trump than support for Biden. But she sees opportunities for Biden to flip more of those conflicted voters in the months ahead. Trump’s vehement personal attacks on Haley – as well as his vituperative comments about E. Jean Carroll and his supporters’ fervid denunciations of Taylor Swift ­– will alienate more GOP-leaning women, Lake believes. And the fact that so many independents have made the effort to participate in a Republican primary to vote against Trump, she said, shows they remain within reach for Biden, even if they are down on his performance now. In addition, Lake noted, the Haley coalition revolves heavily around college-educated voters who are the most likely to express growing optimism about the economy, particularly with the stock market surging. Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster who advised the super PAC supporting DeSantis during his presidential run, takes a position somewhere in between McInturff and Lake. Wilson believes many of the voters flocking to Haley are lost to a Trump-led GOP, but that Trump can win a general election without them. He can offset any defections, Wilson wrote in an email, “by winning votes from groups that would have voted for Democrats prior to the last few elections.” “We can see in some of the recent national polls what his 2024 path to victory might look like,” Wilson added, “and it’s through the White and Hispanic working class rather than by winning over all the Haley voters.” Madrid counters that the primary results so far show Trump faces the risk that his losses among upscale voters compared to 2020 will exceed his gains in blue-collar and non-White communities. Madrid believes Biden’s record on immigration is the biggest obstacle to him harvesting support among the Republicans uneasy about Trump. Discontent over illegal immigration, Madrid argues, is the most powerful weapon Trump will have in a general election to win back Republican-leaning women who both dislike his behavior and support abortion rights. For Biden, who has endorsed a tough bipartisan Senate immigration bill, “the best way he can guarantee his reelection is to crash hard into the center on that issue, and go hard on the border,” Madrid said. Lake doesn’t agree that any single issue is critical for Biden with the kind of GOP voters who have rallied to Haley. Instead, she believes the GOP primaries are again showing that Trump’s biggest weakness are doubts about his character, demeanor and priorities. “We know that they [the Republicans resistant to Trump] are worried about how strong and effective Biden can be,” Lake said. “But the reality is their vote is going to be about Trump; it’s not going to be about Biden. Biden has to be the mirror to show you what Trump really is. Where Trump is chaos, he is steady. Where Trump is about revenge, he is about solutions.” The widespread dissatisfaction with Biden’s performance has generated ominous splits in the Democratic coalition, particularly among younger voters and minority men. Finding ways to exploit the divisions in the GOP coalition that Haley has exposed may be Biden’s best hope of overcoming the cracks in his own electoral foundation."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/bureau-of-prisons-inspector-general-report/index.html,"Washington CNN — Chronic failures by the Bureau of Prisons contributed to the deaths of hundreds of federal prison inmates, the Department of Justice’s Inspector General said in a blistering report released Thursday. The report found that recurring failures within the Bureau of Prisons, such as inaccurate mental health screenings or prison staff missing inmate rounds, led to inmates dying in federal custody. Longstanding institutional issues also limited BOP’s ability to investigate inmate deaths and prevent similar conditions in the future, it said. For years, the embattled Bureau of Prisons has been the subject of accusations by politicians, prisoner advocacy groups for mistreating or neglecting inmates. The Justice Department itself has issued scathing rebukes against BOP, outlining serious mistakes that have led to the deaths of high-profile inmates like notorious Boston gangster and convicted murderer James “Whitey” Bulger , who was killed shortly after being transferred to a new prison, and financier Jeffrey Epstein , who died by suicide in his jail cell. But the circumstances that led to Bulger and Epstein’s deaths are emblematic of wide-ranging and recurring issues within the federal prison system that affect hundreds of inmates across the country, the DOJ’s Office of Inspector General found in its report that outlined a system in crisis failing to protect its charges. The 100-page report analyzed the circumstances of 344 inmates who died by suicide, homicide, accidents or other unknown factors between 2014 and 2021. The OIG recommended several changes to BOP procedure, including developing strategies to ensure that inmate mental health is properly evaluated, that prison staff is taught to use defibrillators and naloxone, and to develop procedures that require inmate death records to be consistently completed and collected. In response to the report, a BOP spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that BOP “acknowledges and concurs with the need for improvements” and is “dedicated to implementing these changes to ensure the safety and well-being of those in our custody.” Issues with existing BOP standards In several of the homicide and suicide cases examined by the OIG, inmates died after prison staff failed to meet standards outlined within BOPs own policies. The report pointed to correctional officers who didn’t complete their assigned duties, improperly filled out paperwork, didn’t bring life-saving equipment when responding to an emergency, gave inaccurate or unclear information on the radio to medical staff, or didn’t know how to administer overdose medication naloxone. For example, correctional staff failed to conduct the required rounds or inmate counts in restrictive housing units before the deaths of at least 86 inmates. In another 17 cases, staff failed to search or did not sufficiently search inmates cells, allowing them to possess excess medication, bed sheets or razors. Investigators pointed to Epstein, noting that before his death he was able to amass an “excessive amount of linens.” In another case, prison staff claimed to have searched an inmate’s cell three times without finding contraband. Days later, the inmate died by a drug overdose after amassing more than 1,000 pills in their cell, the report says. Some staff also allowed inmates to evade metal detectors, the report said, including in 11 homicide cases where inmates weren’t searched, were allowed to walk around metal detectors or not confronted after setting off metal detectors. The OIG also said that guidelines to help prison staff investigate deaths once they had occurred often were adhered to. BOP was “unable to produce documentation required by its own policy for 43% of the inmate deaths in our scope,” the report says, including 117 cases where the BOP failed to acquire death certificates. Prison suicide Recurring violations of BOP’s own policies and operational failures inside prisons led to a staggering amount of inmate suicides, the OIG found, accounting for more than half of the deaths analyzed in their report. Prison staff frequently did not properly evaluate inmates’ mental health, often categorizing inmates who later died by suicide with little to no mental health risks. Other inmates with documented mental health risks were isolated in a special housing unit (SHU) or did not receive the counseling they were supposed to and later died by suicide. In one example highlighted in the report, prison health services staff did not refer an inmate who had swallowed razor blades for psychological help. The inmate went on to be repeatedly placed in the SHU for engaging in violence without the knowledge of the mental health staff at the facility, where he later died by hanging. Staffing crisis A staggering lack of health care and correctional staff within the prisons has also led to a diminished quality of inmate care, the OIG found. In one particularly egregious example, the OIG described the lack of access to healthcare in the notorious Federal Correctional Institution Thomson in Illinois. When the OIG visited Thomson in 2022, according to the report, it had not had an on-side full-time physician for over a year. Additionally, nearly half of its nursing positions were vacant, the report said. These vacancies can drastically affect quality of health care, the report said, or overwhelm staff so dramatically that they quit. Staffing shortages have also forced some institutions to mandate available staff to work overtime shifts, in some cases working 16-hour days several times a week. Other staff members are asked to augment their responsibilities, at times forcing non-correctional officer staff to perform correctional duties – including one case where psychologists were assigned to correctional posts for more than two months.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/white-house-russia-anti-satellite/index.html,"Washington CNN — The White House on Thursday confirmed that the national security threat flagged by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee the previous day is related to “an anti-satellite capability that Russia is developing,” but sought to soothe concerns about the danger it presents to the United States. “This is not an active capability that’s been deployed,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. “And though Russia’s pursuit of this particular capability is troubling there was no immediate threat to anyone’s safety.” “We are not talking about a weapon that can be used to attack human beings or cause physical destruction here on Earth,” Kirby added. Kirby’s comments came a day after the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, ignited a firestorm on Capitol Hill when he issued a cryptic statement announcing that the panel had “information concerning a serious national security threat.” The lack of immediate details about the nature of the threat left many filling in their own blanks about its severity and imminence. Turner has faced withering criticism, even from members of his own party, for publicizing the committee’s knowledge in a vague post to social media, with Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida accusing him of “gaslighting the country,” and Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee demanding an investigation into Turner. Both Gaetz and Ogles said they believe Turner was motivated to make the information public to rouse support for additional funding for Ukraine in its war against Russia. The Kremlin repeated that talking point on Thursday, Reuters reported . Kirby responded to the Kremlin’s claim with one word: “Bollocks.” He later added that the US is still in the process of reaching out to Russia for conversations on Moscow’s anti-satellite capabilities. “We’ll have to see” whether public disclosure of the threat might make those conversations more difficult, he said. Turner has publicly supported continuing to fund the Ukraine war effort, even as former President Donald Trump has supported the GOP push to oppose a $60 billion aid package to support Ukraine. Other members of the Intelligence Committee came to Turner’s defense. Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw defended Turner’s decision to publicize the information. Referencing the allegations that Turner planned the release to coincide with efforts to provide additional funding, Crenshaw said the timing was a coincidence. “There was notifications from the intelligence community that made it just clearer now than before,” Crenshaw said. “This was just the time.” The post from Turner called on President Joe Biden to declassify “all information” related to the threat. Kirby said the US intelligence community had “serious concerns” about a broad declassification of intelligence related to the threat. He added that private engagement, “rather than immediately publicizing the intelligence, could be a much more effective approach.” The United States has been aware of Russia’s pursuit of anti-satellite capability going back “many, many months, if not a few years,” Kirby said, and Biden has been briefed on it since the outset of his term. He said it was only in recent weeks that the intelligence community has been “able to assess with a higher sense of confidence exactly how Russia continues to pursue it.” As to whether the intelligence should be downgraded, Kirby said the administration has been following a rigorous process, and wouldn’t be “knocked off” that by Turner’s decision to publicize the threat on Wednesday. He denied the administration provided a green light to Turner to make the information public. While Kirby said the Russian capabilities do not pose a threat to human life, an anti-satellite weapon placed in orbit around Earth would pose a significant danger to US nuclear command and control satellites, Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN on Wednesday. The US relies on such satellites – which he called “essential” – to ensure constant, seamless control over its nuclear arsenal. Russia has pursued counterspace systems designed to neutralize US military and commercial space systems for years, according to a 2022 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report on space security. Russian doctrine called for being able to target an enemy’s satellites from the ground, air, cyber and space, using attacks that range from temporary jamming to outright destruction.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/emhoff-meeting-jewish-arab-youth-gaza/index.html,"CNN — Second gentleman Doug Emhoff slipped into New York on Thursday for a small meeting with youth leaders selected from across the Jewish American, Muslim American and Palestinian American communities, marking the administration’s latest move in its evolving response to the Israel-Hamas war . The event, hosted by United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Rashad Hussain, the US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, was kept quiet by administration officials hoping to facilitate a conversation, rather than a debate or another opportunity for the protests that have followed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris across the country. But Emhoff is not involved with administration policy, so the discussion was not about a ceasefire nor negotiations over a hostage release nor the White House’s maneuvering with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Nor was it about ongoing political fallout, according to a person in the room. It focused on how the situation has affected people in America, billed as “a roundtable discussion on the sharp rise in Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate after the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel.” In January, the Anti-Defamation League recorded a 361% rise in reported antisemitic incidents in the three months after the Hamas attack began on October 7 compared to the same period in 2022. In November, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it had received an “unprecedented” rise in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents in the month following the start of the war. “These communities have felt real pain, fear, and isolation,” Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement to CNN. “In this moment in which it’s all too easy to focus on what divides us, we must carve out moments like today’s roundtable to remember what unites us: to find shared humanity, and shared purpose, in one another’s stories, and work together to create a lasting peace for all.” Though he was working on the issue before, Emhoff’s portfolio as second gentleman has increasingly been consumed with countering hate across the country since October 7. He’s had community conversations with leaders in Michigan, California and at Cornell University in New York. But Thursday’s event – coordinated by Andrew Weinstein, who was appointed by President Joe Biden in 2022 to serve as a public delegate to the United Nations – was the first structured specifically around youth leaders, and across Jewish Americans and Arab Americans at once. The event itself was kept closed to the public and press, but the person in the room described an honest conversation defined by participants talking about their own experiences over the last few months, with Emhoff, Thomas-Greenfield and Hussain mostly listening. Emhoff finished by talking about the need to keep building coalitions and executing on the national strategy to combat antisemitism and the coming strategy on combating Islamophobia, the person in the room said. An aide to the US mission to the United Nations explained that the names of the participants were kept private to protect sensitive discussions. “Obviously everyone didn’t agree on policy, but everyone agreed on the need to combat hate and to work against dehumanization,” said another person familiar with the event."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/trump-makes-final-pitch-to-supreme-court-in-fraught-immunity-case/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch Thursday to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. “There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing . “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.” Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument. The Supreme Court is expected to decide on Trump’s request within a few days. With Trump’s final brief in hand, a question of timing is now squarely before the high court. The justices could deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue or they could agree to further consider his case. A view of the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday morning January 4, 2024 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Related article Special counsel urges Supreme Court to deny Trump’s request for delay in immunity case The first outcome would clear the way for a US District court in Washington, DC, to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to resolve before the November election. The second could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months. On Monday, Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down last week that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. “Without immunity from criminal prosecution, the presidency as we know it will cease to exist,” Trump told the Supreme Court. Two days later – ahead of deadline – Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause. “The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy,” Smith wrote in a filing Wednesday. “The public interest in a prompt trial is at its zenith where, as here, a former president is charged with conspiring to subvert the electoral process so that he could remain in office.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/white-house-letter-special-counsel/index.html,"Washington CNN — The White House wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland the day before special counsel Robert Hur’s report was released, vehemently objecting to aspects of the report – including its “multiple denigrating statements” about the president’s memory. The letter was the culmination of a months-long attempt by Biden’s team to weigh in on the investigation into President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents through letters to Hur and eventually to Hur’s boss, the attorney general. Ultimately, Hur did not appear to heed calls by Biden’s lawyers to produce a narrow and concise report limited to the facts of the charging decision. Instead, the 388-page report — which declined to bring charges — sparked a political firestorm by making repeated references to Biden’s inability to recall dates and details. “We object to the multiple denigrating statements about President Biden’s memory which violate longstanding DOJ practice and policy,” Biden’s personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, and White House counsel, Edward Siskel, wrote in a three-page letter to Garland on February 7. “This report goes further to include allegations that the President has a failing memory in a general sense, an allegation that has no law enforcement purpose.” The lawyers wrote that “a global and pejorative judgment on the President’s powers of recollection in general is uncalled for and unfounded.” In the February 7 letter, Biden’s lawyers likened Hur’s efforts in his report to those of James Comey, the FBI director in 2016 who criticized then-candidate Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server, despite not bringing charges. The lawyers wrote Hur’s report “mirrors one of the most widely-recognized examples in recent history of inappropriate prosecutor criticism of uncharged conduct.” “The FBI and DOJ personnel’s criticism of uncharged conduct during investigations in connection with the 2016 election was found to violate ‘long-standing Department practice and protocol,’” the lawyers wrote. Politico and The New York Times published copies of the letter. The White House counsel’s office declined to comment. The letter underscores the deep anger generated by Hur’s report inside the White House and lays bare tensions between Biden’s team and Garland. CNN has previously reported that frustrations have run high inside the White House regarding some of Garland’s decisions related to the classified documents matter. The letter to Garland also objected to Hur’s characterization of Biden’s practice of retaining personal diaries, saying that even though “prior Presidents have done exactly the same thing,” the special counsel described the behavior as “totally irresponsible.” Hur’s report, which concluded that criminal charges were not warranted against Biden regarding his handling of classified documents, made numerous references to the president’s memory and recall issues that were allegedly exhibited during his multi-hour interview with Hur in October. Since the report’s release, the White House and the president’s lawyers have strenuously objected to the handling of the investigation and, in particular, the references to Biden’s memory issues as gratuitous and inappropriate. A day after Hur’s report was released publicly, a top Justice Department official responded by defending the document and its inclusion of details about Biden’s memory. “The context in which this information is used in the report makes it appropriate under Department policy and the Special Counsel regulations. The identified language is neither gratuitous nor unduly prejudicial because it is not offered to criticize or demean the President,” wrote Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer to Biden’s team. Weinsheimer, the department’s top career official, also pushed back on Biden’s lawyers’ comparison to Comey, calling it “inapt,” as Comey was an FBI director and not a special counsel. He said Hur’s report was “readily distinguishable from Director Comey’s press conference” about the Clinton email server. On February 12, four days after the Hur report was released, Bauer and Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, responded to Weinsheimer – to once again disagree with the DOJ’s assessment that Hur’s report was consistent with the department’s policy and practice. In this letter, the lawyers cited – among others – former Attorney General Eric Holder, who said that the Hur report “contains way too many gratuitous remarks and is flatly inconsistent with long standing DOJ traditions.” This story has been updated with additional information."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/mike-turner-republican-reaction/index.html,"House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner is facing sharp criticism – including from within his own party – as some GOP lawmakers are complaining that a statement the Ohio Republican made Wednesday was alarmist, “constituted poor judgement” and should be investigated. Some of Turner’s colleagues believe he was drawing attention to a Russian threat to build support for Ukraine aid and others believe it was his effort to push for his version of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act overhaul that was facing a vote later in the day. “It’s f***ing bullsh*t,” one prominent House Republican told CNN of Turner’s move. “He ought to lose his job. He did that to get his way on FISA.” Others were just as unnerved by the move. “I don’t know what his motives were it just to me, it just looks bad,” Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I have a bad feeling about this.” Another Tennessee Republican, Rep. Andy Ogles, sent a scathing letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday calling for an investigation into Turner for his vague statements, calling his disclosure “reckless” and asserting he disregarded of the consequences. “This act constituted poor judgement at a minimum and a complete breach of trust influenced by the pursuit of a political agenda at a maximum … it is with great reticence that I formally request an inquiry as to any impact the Chairman’s statements may have had on U.S. foreign and domestic policy,” Ogles wrote. CNN has reached out to Johnson for comment on the letter. Not long after Turner released his statement warning of a “serious national security threat,” Johnson arranged a last-minute news conference in the Capitol to make clear there’s “no need for public alarm” and clarifying he had already requested a briefing on the matter a month ago. Turner did not give the House speaker’s office a heads up prior to making his public statement characterizing the matter as a “serious national security threat,” according to a source familiar with the matter. Turner did, however, inform Johnson he would be requesting that the Biden administration declassify information about the threat, another source said. GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas, a member of the Intelligence Committee, defended Turner’s actions and blasted members who want him investigated. Asked about the letter from Ogles, Crenshaw said, Ogles “needs to f***ing check himself.” “He doesn’t know what he is talking about,” Crenshaw said. “It’s absurd. It’s a deeply absurd action. I am tired of people making extremely passionate, opinionated actions based on no knowledge.” Asked about some of the theories members are floating that Turner was using his position to try and drum up support for Ukraine aid and other theories as to why Turner released the statement, Crenshaw said the timing was just coincidence. “It’s coincidence,” he said. “There was notifications from the intelligence community that made it just clearer now than before. This was just the time.” Turner issued a statement defending his decision to make the national security threat available to members, but the statement does not address why Turner decided to make his statement public, which has caused backlash. Turner said he worked with the Biden administration to notify Congress about the national security threat and that the administration cleared his statement with the top Democrat on the panel before it got sent to lawmakers. The committee voted on Tuesday to release the information to lawmakers, and Turner said that vote was 23-1. Turner’s initial statement came hours before the House was scheduled to take a vote related to reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a vote that was later postponed due to opposition from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members had been pushing for amendment votes. Members of the Freedom Caucus later tanked a procedural vote on unrelated legislation Wednesday evening. Ogles tied Turner’s statement to trying to drum up support for passing the FISA package. “In hindsight, it has become clear that the intent was not to ensure the safety of our homeland and the American people, but rather to ensure additional funding for Ukraine and passage of an unreformed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).” GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz accused Turner of “gaslighting the country” about the seriousness of the security threat members were briefed on Thursday in order to promote Ukraine funding. “We put out our concern with Chairman Turner gaslighting the country on these things,” Gaetz told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I worry that the motivation to draw so much attention to this is less about intelligence and national security and more about a politician who wants to send $60 billion to Ukraine,” he said, “and wants to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that we want to see substantially curtailed because of the spying abuses.” CNN reported Wednesday that the US has new intelligence on Russian military capabilities related to its efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space, according to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence. The intelligence was briefed to Congress and key US allies, and some lawmakers say it is serious enough that it should be declassified and made public. One Democratic member with deep national security experience said Wednesday that they had never before received that kind of urgent summons over a national security matter during their time in Congress — and that the intelligence they saw when they arrived was not urgent enough to justify Turner’s comments.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/texas-immigration-law-doj/index.html,"CNN — A federal judge on Thursday expressed concern and skepticism over a controversial law that makes entering Texas illegally a state crime while hearing oral arguments over a motion for a preliminary injunction to block the law. The measure, SB4, which is set to go into effect on March 5, grants local and state law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and state judges the ability to issue orders to remove them to Mexico. The Department of Justice sued the state , arguing the federal government has exclusive authority to enforce immigration law. US District Judge David Ezra emphasized that he was sympathetic to the state’s concerns about the complicated situation at the border and the issues plaguing the country’s immigration system, making it clear that something must be done to improve the nation’s immigration laws. He also added that he’s served as a federal judge in several cities along the border, including San Diego and Del Rio. But Ezra was not shy in critiquing the bill passed by the state’s legislature last year and fully embraced by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott . Civil rights groups and immigration advocacy groups who are also part of the lawsuit have warned that the bill will separate families, lead to racial profiling and make undocumented migrants who are already in the US fearful of reporting crimes. Ezra sharply questioned several provisions within the law and flat out rejected the state’s argument that an “invasion” was taking place at the Texas-Mexico border. The state argued in the Austin courtroom that SB4 is complementary — not in conflict — with federal law and that Texas is “entitled to defend itself from an invasion,” especially from what it called a “full-scale invasion of transnational criminal cartels.” While he acknowledged the role cartels play in the border crisis, Ezra pushed back at the notion that an influx of migrants constituted an “invasion.” “I really do not see any evidence that Texas is at war,” he said, though he said the state is “definitely under pressure.” Ezra also speculated that if he were to rule that SB4 was “perfectly fine,” it could ignite a domino effect of other states creating their own interpretations of federal immigration law — a situation he described as a “nightmare.” Ryan Walters, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, pointed out that states along the border largely enforced their own immigration laws and deported migrants until the late 1800s. Ezra countered that because the states were “doing their own thing,” Congress stepped in and created a unified law over who can come into the country. Ezra said the law still needs more work, “but that doesn’t mean the law we have isn’t enforceable.” Further, he said the removal provisions in the Texas legislation would burden state judges with making decisions that typically fall within the jurisdiction of immigration judges. He worried parts of the law would confuse judges over whether to follow state or federal statutes, especially when it comes to a migrant who’s legally seeking asylum while also facing felony prosecution from the state. “It is a quandary of some proportion,” Ezra said. The state argued that arresting migrants is not unprecedented for the state, as it’s been arresting migrants for trespassing for more than two years. But the judge argued there was a difference, saying SB4 “goes far beyond that” by allowing a judge to order a migrant to be removed once prosecuted. Ezra said he would rule “as quickly as I possibly can,” assuring both parties he would give enough time for either side to file an appeal. The judge made clear he did not see this case ending quickly. “I would not be surprised at all if this case finds its way to the Supreme Court,” he said.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/donald-trump-campaign-trial/index.html,"New York City CNN — One of Donald Trump’s longstanding complaints will become a reality on March 25: His legal peril will force him off the campaign trail – at least during the day. The trial date, set Thursday by a judge in New York, is just a week after Trump’s campaign expects him to reach the delegate threshold to become the presumptive Republican nominee – and roughly seven months before voters will head to ballot box to cast their votes in the 2024 presidential election. While Trump has spent the last year bouncing in and out of court houses in his various legal cases, almost all of these appearances have been voluntary other than his arraignments. The former president often opts to treat the courtroom as a campaign stop, speaking to cameras and ranting against what he has called “political persecution.” Come March, Trump will no longer have a choice – he will be required to sit in the New York courtroom four days a week as he faces 34 criminal charges brought by District Attorney Alvin Bragg in an alleged hush-money scheme. The trial is expected to last for roughly six weeks, with court in session every weekday but Wednesdays, severely limiting Trump’s ability to campaign for president during that time. And the New York trial may not be the last that keeps Trump off the campaign trail before the election, with two federal trials still possible this year, along with a case in Georgia that is still pending despite the trouble now facing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. While Trump may effectively bring an end to the GOP nominating fight before the criminal trial begins, the proceedings could disrupt the former president’s pivot to a general election matchup with President Joe Biden – dividing his attention between his legal battles and his political campaign. During this primary season, the former president was far outpaced on the trail by his GOP rivals, often choosing to spend time at his Mar-a-Lago home or in a courtroom instead of visiting early voting states. Part of this, his advisers insist, was the enormous lead Trump held over his Republican opponents, a large lead that disappears in a potential rematch against Biden. Trump has painted the cases brought against him as “election interference,” linking the unrelated impending trials as one unfounded conspiracy brought by Democrats and Biden to keep Trump from another term in the White House. Trump’s attorney Todd Blanche even echoed Trump’s rhetoric about election interference Thursday as he objected to the start date, but the judge made clear he was not going to delay – not just because of the election but because Trump has another three potential trials still looming in other jurisdictions. ‘Campaigning during the night’ While this rhetoric has served as a rallying cry for Republicans in the primary season, Trump’s team is grappling with how his criminal trials will play in a general election in which the former president will have to court independent voters to claim the White House, multiple people close to the former president told CNN. “The big question mark that remains is, will seeing Trump in court – and the witnesses who will be paraded in – hurt him in the general (election),” a person close to Trump told CNN. “I think it’ll be less of a problem in the Bragg trial, but it’s still an issue they’ve yet to figure out.” Some of Trump’s advisers, meanwhile, insist they remain confident that his legal troubles will continue to help his campaign – not just with primary voters, but with general election voters as well. Despite having some concerns immediately following his four indictments that the boost his campaign saw in fundraising in polling would only be short-lived, Trump has continued to enjoy some positive effects from his legal battles. They also point to how many legal experts argue that the criminal hush money case is the weakest and believe having this trial go first will help solidify Trump’s support with voters who think he is facing what they are argue are too many criminal charges. In private, however, Trump’s team recognizes that the necessities of court will likely affect the campaign, and provide further ammunition for Biden’s reelection efforts, people close to Trump said. Trump claimed Thursday that he would still be able to campaign while attending the trial by doing so “in the evening.” “I’ll be here during the day, and I’ll be campaigning during the night,” Trump said, suggesting Biden should do the same. One senior adviser, however, hesitated at that proposal, calling such a schedule “unsustainable” and “exhausting” for the former president. The New York criminal trial also presents another problem for Trump’s ability to create a media circus – cameras are not allowed in the courtroom. Thursday’s hearing likely previewed how the spring months in the courthouse will play out, with Trump finding his way to the camera in the hallway outside before and after the hearing to argue his case in the court of public opinion. ‘He has to be there’ Unlike Trump’s past visits to courtrooms – most of which were voluntary – the former president’s team anticipates that his attendance will be mandatory at most, if not all, of his trial in Manhattan, his advisers said. “I think he has to be there. It’s a criminal trial, we expect it will be mandatory,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN. At a pretrial hearing Thursday, Judge Juan Merchan said that he expected the trial to go on for six weeks. With Trump sitting at his side looking on, Blanche tried to object to Merchan’s decision to begin the trial on March 25, arguing both that Trump had other three other criminal trials his lawyers had to prepare for and that keeping Trump in the courtroom would impede his presidential campaign. Blanche said that the trial date was “unconstitutional,” pointing to the upcoming GOP primaries. “President Trump says it all the time, and the media makes fun of him, but it’s election interference” to make Trump sit here in this courtroom, Blanche argued. But the judge shut down the arguments, saying he’d already heard them and had made his ruling. The judge responded saying Trump would not be required to sit for two criminal trials at the same time. “Certainly, I don’t want to violate his constitutional rights nor does anybody else,” Merchan said. Blanche tried one more time at the very end of the hearing to make his case to the judge – and perhaps to Trump. “We strenuously object to what is happening in this courtroom,” he said. “The fact that President Trump is going to now spend the next two months working on this trial instead of out on the campaign trail running for president, is something that should not happen in this country,” he said. “What’s your legal argument?” Merchan asked. “That’s my legal argument,” he responded. “That’s not a legal argument,” Merchan said, ending the hearing and telling the lawyers – and the former president – he’d see them all on March 25. Trump team sees NY case as weakest While neither Trump nor his campaign want to face trial, many allies would rather see the New York hush money case go to trial than the other three criminal cases, with a belief that the case from Bragg, a Democrat, is the weakest and easiest to paint as politically motivated. The campaign plans to use the trial to set the stage for its core political argument that these trials are purely political and designed to hurt Trump’s chances in a general election – an argument it has and will continue to use in all of the former president’s criminal and civil cases. As Trump has demonstrated over the course of his campaign, he sees those fights as part of one larger conflict and has used his court challenges to rally support in the GOP primary. “I think we’ve done a good job of managing the political schedule with the legal schedule,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN. “He’s been able to turn the legal stuff into a political positive.” Trump’s advisers expect the former president to have enough delegates by March 19, following primary contests in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio, to be considered the presumptive Republican nominee. The general election could pose a different test for Trump, particularly if he is found guilty of a crime. Despite his dominant wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, 31% of Republican caucus-goers and 42% of GOP primary voters in the Granite State said Trump would not be fit for the presidency if convicted of a crime. Those findings underscore the importance of Trump’s strategy of delaying the criminal cases he is facing for as long as possible. Before Trump entered the courtroom Thursday morning, he stopped at the camera in the hallway outside to speak. The former president complained that he was there – and not in South Carolina campaigning. “How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again – this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said. Of course, Trump did not have to be in the courtroom on Thursday. Merchan waived his appearance at his lawyer’s request for the pretrial hearing – though that was because Trump was considering attending a hearing in Georgia instead, where Willis is facing scrutiny. In six weeks, however, Trump won’t have the same luxury of choosing where he wants to be four days a week. CNN’s Terence Burlij contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/robert-hur-hearing-march-12/index.html,"Special counsel Robert Hur is expected to testify at a public hearing in front of the House Judiciary Committee on March 12, sources familiar with the plans told CNN. Hur investigated President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents but ultimately declined to bring criminal charges and said the facts stopped short of finding he willfully retained classified material. But in doing so, Hur offered a deeply damaging portrait of an aging president beset by memory issues, who had trouble recalling dates and details during his five-hour interview with the special counsel. House Republicans had reached out to Hur to discuss having him testify in front of the Judiciary Committee about his report, CNN reported earlier this week . House Republicans leading the impeachment inquiry into Biden also asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to turn over the transcript of the special counsel’s interview with the president in a new letter on Monday. Republican committee chairs are also asking the Department of Justice to supply Congress with “any recordings, notes, or summaries” of the special counsel’s interview with the president."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/blinken-americans-west-bank-investigation/index.html,"CNN — US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday offered his “deepest condolences” to the families of two Palestinian-American teenagers “who reportedly were killed” in the West Bank and said that there must be an investigation into their deaths. “We’ve made clear that with regard to the incidents you’ve alluded to, there needs to be an investigation. We need to get the facts. And if appropriate, there needs to be accountability,” Blinken said at a press conference in Albania in response to a question from CNN’s Alex Marquardt. Two 17-year-old Palestinian-Americans were reportedly killed in the West Bank by Israeli forces in less than a month. 17-year-old Mohammad Ahmed Mohammad Khdour was shot in the head by Israeli forces on Saturday while traveling by car in the town of Biddu, according to the organization “Defense for Children – Palestine.” CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces about the reported shooting. The US Office of Palestinian Affairs said in a post on X that it was “devastated by the killing.” Last month, another American, 17-year-old Tawfic Abdel, was fatally shot in the head, according to Palestinian news agency WAFA. The IDF and Israeli police told CNN that they had opened an investigation into the incident. A number of American citizens have also been detained by Israeli forces in recent weeks. Blinken would not give details on their cases, citing privacy laws. “I can just say in general, without reference to specific cases, we insist that people be treated fairly, that they be treated with due process, and that they be treated humanely,” he said. “That’s something that, regardless of where an American citizen might be detained, we insist on. And we’ll continue to insist on.” Two Americans, Hashem Alagha, 20, and Borak Alagha, 18, were detained by Israeli forces during a raid of a home in Gaza last week, according to a family member in the United States. An American woman, Samaher Esmail , was taken from her home in the West Bank and detained more than a week ago by Israeli forces. Her family alleges that she was beaten and denied medication in custody. A spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service told CNN that she is “being held in accordance with the law” and “given medical treatment for medical problems that arose even before her arrest.” In a statement to CNN Tuesday, the IDF said Esmail was arrested during “a battalion operation that took place in the area of the village of Silwad to arrest terror suspects” on February 5. “All those arrested in the operation were transferred to the security forces for further treatment,” the IDF said. The IDF did not address the family’s claims about Esmail’s mistreatment in custody and referred further questions to the Israel Prison Service, to whom CNN has reached out. The IDF response also did not provide further details about the alleged “incitement on social media.” According to the family, Esmail was detained because of “10-year-old Facebook posts and political cartoons she shared.” Posts from Esmail’s Facebook seen by CNN show cartoons favorably depicting Hamas and two photos of her holding a gun. Family spokesperson Jonathan Franks said the gun is in Louisiana, where Esmail also resides and legally owns the firearm. “Ms. Esmail’s opinions may be disfavored in Israel proper, but the inescapable reality is they were protected speech which no rational person could consider an incitement to violence,” the statement released by Franks on behalf of the family said."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/nikki-haley-secret-service-protection/index.html,"CNN — A congressional advisory committee has voted in favor of granting Nikki Haley US Secret Service protection, according to a source familiar with the matter, after the GOP presidential candidate requested the enhanced security citing threats she is facing. The recommendation now heads to the desk of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , who will make the final decision based on multiple factors, the source said. Mayorkas, who earlier this week became the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in 150 years, is currently traveling in Germany for the Munich Security Conference. The protective detail is expected to be approved and Haley would get a protective detail as soon as next week, a second source familiar with the matter told CNN. The Secret Service has multiple protection teams ready to be dispatched, and one of those teams would be sent to protect the former South Carolina governor on the same day that it is authorized to do so, the first source said. The congressional advisory committee that makes the determination whether it believes a presidential candidate should qualify for protection includes the House speaker, House minority whip, Senate majority and minority leaders, and one additional member chosen by the panel. But the advisory committee’s finding is only one of multiple factors that Mayorkas will consider when making the final decision on granting the Secret Service protection to Haley. The other factors include, but are not limited to: an assessment conducted by the Secret Service of threats directed toward the candidate; whether the candidate is polling nationally at 15% or more for 30 consecutive days; and whether the candidate is the formal or de facto nominee of a major party for president or vice president. Haley is currently the last remaining major challenger to former President Donald Trump in the Republican primary. Her campaign requested Secret Service protection earlier this month over threats faced by the candidate. There were reports of two swatting incidents in recent months at Haley’s home in South Carolina, one of which occurred while her parents were there. Haley’s campaign and the Department of Homeland Security did not comment on the matter. This story has been updated with additional information."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/georgia-trump-hearing/index.html,"CNN — A hearing that could derail the election subversion case against Donald Trump and others in Georgia is underway as a judge considers whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified. The two-day evidentiary hearing is a pivotal moment for the Georgia RICO case. Trump and co-defendants are seeking to remove Willis based on allegations that she and Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to lead the case, engaged in an improper romantic relationship which financially benefitted the district attorney. If Trump and his co-defendants succeed in disqualifying Willis, some inside the DA’s office fear it could derail the entire case, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking. The sprawling racketeering case still has no trial date, and Willis and her team are keenly aware that the window to go to trial before the 2024 election is rapidly shrinking. Any delay could mean Trump could avoid a trial on his efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat or connections to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack until after Election Day. Trump’s federal trial is already delayed due to a request for the Supreme Court to intervene. It’s unclear if another prosecutor in Georgia would even be inclined to take up the case from Willis, given its political and legal challenges. Wade and Willis acknowledged in court filings that they had a personal relationship but deny any wrongdoing. Willis argued there’s no basis for her to be disqualified or for the case to be dismissed. During a hearing earlier this week, Willis’s attorneys failed to convince Judge Scott McAfee that the motions to disqualify her and dismiss the case should be denied without an evidentiary hearing. McAfee called for the hearing Thursday to “establish the record on those core allegations” against Willis and Wade and their relationship. “That is no longer a matter of complete speculation. The state has admitted a relationship existed,” McAfee said Monday. “So what remains to be proven is the existence and extent of any financial benefit, again if there even was one. Because I think it’s possible that the facts alleged by the defendant could result in disqualification.” If Willis survives the challenge, the DA’s office believes it has an opportunity to hit the reset button on the case and turn its focus back to preparing for trial, which prosecutors hope to begin in August. Willis and Wade are among those expected to testify. Others who could be called to testify include two top DA attorneys, Wade, members of Willis’s personal security team and Willis’s father. Allegations against Wade and Willis The alleged affair was first raised by Trump’s co-defendant, former 2020 campaign official Mike Roman, last month in a court filing accusing Willis of financially benefiting from selecting Wade when he took her on lavish vacations, paid partly with what he billed her office for work on the case. Willis appointed Wade special prosecutor to assist in the investigation in 2021. But there was little direct evidence included in that initial filing seeking her dismissal and for the case to be tossed, an effort Trump has since joined. Since then, credit card statements revealed in Wade’s divorce case show he paid for two plane tickets for Willis to San Francisco and Miami. Trump and the 14 remaining co-defendants were indicted by Willis last summer and have pleaded not guilty. Four other co-defendants have already pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors to testify. Roman’s attorney Ashleigh Merchant told CNN she plans to call Wade as the first witness. “We are focusing on what the judge asked us to show him – the personal and financial benefits that Willis got from Wade,” Merchant told CNN. “The money trail, history of lies.” A ‘star witness’ and nearly a dozen subpoenas Merchant has subpoenaed nearly a dozen others to testify during Thursday’s hearing, including DA employees and Willis herself. McAfee said that he will allow Merchant – who represents Roman – to question her “star” witness and Wade’s former law partner, Terrence Bradley, on Thursday. Bradley also represented Wade during his divorce proceedings, which also highlighted Wade and Willis’s relationship. In previous court filings, Merchant has said Bradley’s testimony will refute the claim from Willis and Wade that their personal relationship began after she appointed him in late 2021 to lead the case against Trump and his allies. In an affidavit submitted to the court earlier this month, Wade wrote that he has “never cohabited” with Willis. Merchant contends that Bradley would dispute that assertion. “Bradley will confirm that Willis and Wade stayed together,” Merchant said in a court filing that referred to them staying together beginning in the fall of 2022 in a “safehouse” that Fulton County rented for Willis. What if Willis is disqualified? If McAfee decides to grant the co-defendants’ motions and remove Willis from prosecuting the sprawling RICO case, under Georgia law the case would automatically be re-assigned to the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, a bipartisan collaboration of six district attorneys and three solicitors general from across the state. The council’s executive director, Peter Skandalakis, would be responsible for either appointing a new district attorney from a separate county to oversee the case or a private lawyer, attorney general, or one of the members of the council. “It’s a historic indictment, it’s a historic event, and you have to find somebody with the resources and experience that is capable of handling this type of case,” Skandalakis told CNN, adding that in this scenario, he would appoint a candidate that actually wanted the high-profile case. “This case has a lot of people emotionally tied to it and that does make things a little bit more complex because there is the security issue that always goes along with a case of this magnitude that has this much attention,” he said. Could Wade leave the case voluntarily? While CNN has reported that Willis has no plans to voluntarily recuse herself from the Georgia RICO case, sources were less definitive when asked about Wade’s future. Some legal experts have called for Wade to step aside on his own even if the allegations against him and Willis do not meet the legal threshold for disqualification. “I think it is the wise thing to do, but it is not legally required for him to step aside,” Norm Eisen, who served as White House ethics czar during the Obama administration and is a CNN legal analyst, told reporters last month. Eisen added the allegations do not concern him with regard to Willis’ ability to try the case. Wade’s immediate future remains unclear. Sources said there are no immediate plans for him to step down but if he did, Willis could replace him with another lead prosecutor or lean on her experienced staff in order to avoid a delay."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/politics/us-allies-disrupt-russian-hacking/index.html,"CNN — The FBI and its international allies disrupted a network of over 1,000 hacked internet routers that Russia’s military intelligence agency was using for cyber espionage operations against the United States and its European allies, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday. The law enforcement operation used a court order to cut off access to the home and small-business routers hacked by the Russian GRU military intelligence agency, kicking them out and “lock[ing] the door behind them,” Wray said at the Munich Security Conference. The Russian hackers were using the network of hacked routers, which is known as a botnet, to target US and foreign governments, and “military, security and corporate organizations” for intelligence gathering, the Justice Department announced . The Russian Embassy in Washington, DC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wray’s allegations. Wray also used his podium in Munich — where intelligence officials from around the world gather every year — to reiterate US warnings that Russia and China-backed hacking teams have long sought a foothold in US energy and telecommunications networks. US officials worry that Beijing could use that access to take networks offline in the event of a crisis. Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, “we’ve seen Russia conducting reconnaissance on the US energy sector,” Wray said. “And that’s a particularly worrisome trend because we know that once access is established, the hacker can switch from information gathering to attack quickly and without notice.” The disclosure of the FBI operation comes as US officials and lawmakers grapple with another more concerning Russian capability. The US has new intelligence on Russian military capabilities related to its efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space, CNN reported Wednesday. “Russia has made murder, rape and mayhem its stock and trade, so no one should question its continued willingness to launch destructive cyberattacks before and during military conflict,” the FBI chief added. Wray delivered a stark warning to US lawmakers last month that Chinese hackers were preparing to “wreak havoc” on US critical infrastructure in the event of a crisis. In Munich on Thursday, Wray said that Beijing’s hackers had been “prepositioning” in US oil and natural gas company networks since 2011, “but these days it’s [reached] something closer to a fever pitch.” “What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing buildout of offensive [cyber] weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.” The Chinese government routinely denies those allegations and in turn accuses the US of conducting hacking operations against China. Wray’s announcement is the latest move by the FBI to use court orders to try to stifle complex hacking operations from Russian spy agencies. Weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the FBI went public with a similar operation to neutralize another botnet allegedly controlled by a different GRU hacking team that comprised thousands of infected hardware devices. US intelligence agencies also use hacking operations to try to thwart Russia, China and other rival governments. But unlike the FBI’s court-authorized work, details of those US cyber operations rarely, if ever, are made public."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/tiktok-biden-campaign/index.html,"CNN — The Biden campaign’s venture onto TikTok has been met with mixed reviews, as some supporters praise the attempt to explore new ways to reach young adults while others insist the account needs to engage on a more substantive level to appear authentic. The account, created Sunday, has released a dozen posts, a mix of cable news clips bashing former President Donald Trump , jokes about President Joe Biden ’s age, a Super Bowl video featuring the Dark Brandon meme and a clip of campaign staffers defending him against special counsel Robert Hur’s comments on his mental acuity. Supporters of the president’s reelection efforts say the new account is a step in the right direction and offers an outlet to better tout what his administration has accomplished for young people, such as a TikTok featuring a former school principal whose student loans were forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But critics, and some allies, warn that there is a fine line between genuinely engaging with voters and being performative. “If he is just getting on the platform to share memes, I think he’s going to find tons of pushback and comment sections that are full of people calling him out,” Dakota Hall, executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action, told CNN. A new source for news For the Biden campaign, joining the social media site presents the possibility for modest rewards but also high risks. Digital strategists see TikTok as a critical tool for Democratic candidates to reach young voters, a bloc that has soured on Biden amidst rising inflation, concerns about his age and his administration’s response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “I think they had to launch one,” said Cate Domino, a senior vice president for digital at Precision Strategies, a Democratic consulting firm. “At this point, TikTok use has grown extremely rapidly, even in the past four years, and to not have a place to contribute to the narrative there would be malpractice.” Biden won 60% of 18- to 29-year-old voters and 52% of 30- to 44-year-olds in 2020, according to CNN exit poll data. But recent polling has shown his grasp on that bloc slipping . A CNN/SSRS poll released February 1 found Biden winning 49% of 18- to 34-year-olds, compared to 46% who backed Trump. While only a third of Americans have ever used TikTok, 62% of 18- to 29-year-olds have, according to a survey by Pew Research released last month. Last November, Pew found that 32% of 18- to 29-year-olds regularly get their news from the app. “The campaign is now on TikTok because frankly that’s where people are,” Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster said in a statement to CNN. “Having a presence on TikTok gives us the chance to maximize the reach of the president’s vision.” Campaigns have, for the most part, avoided the platform. Republicans have supported banning the app, which is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company, over national security and spying concerns. Biden signed legislation banning the use of TikTok on government devices in 2022. Those concerns have kept the White House off the app and may have delayed the Biden campaign’s decision to join. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the ban remains in effect. The campaign has said they are taking “advanced safety precautions” around the app. Despite security concerns, some politicians have found success on the app. Democratic Rep. Jeff Jackson of North Carolina has amassed 2.5 million followers with his straight-to-camera videos explaining the goings on of Congress. Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, has more than 240,000 followers on his account, which was launched during his 2022 run against Republican Mehmet Oz. The account used memes to bash Oz and paint him as a financially out of touch carpetbagger. “It’s not a copy and paste formula,” said Annie Wu Henry, a digital communications strategist who ran Fetterman’s account. “It shouldn’t look the same, because you shouldn’t be telling one person to do something that doesn’t feel right or make sense for them.” Unlike the Fetterman and Jackson accounts, the Biden campaign’s account – Biden-Harris HQ – is not solely focused on the president, who has appeared in less than half of the videos so far. One two-minute TikTok posted Tuesday features communications director Michael Tyler and deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty defending Biden and blasting press coverage of the Hur report on the president’s handling of classified papers. The report did not recommend charges against Biden but said the president presented as a “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” and struggled to recall key details, including the year his son Beau died. The president and his allies have pushed back against what they said were false characterization of Biden’s memory. “There’s one line in the document that matters: the first one,” Tyler says in the video. “Joe Biden was completely cleared of wrongdoing, and with your help we’ll beat Donald Trump, the lazy media narrative and the MAGA Republicans they’re enabling in November.” Coming off phony Some groups supporting the president’s reelection efforts say Biden joining the social media platform is a step in the right direction that could help him better tout what his administration has done for young people. “It’s a meaningful signal that the Biden campaign acknowledges the power that young voters will have in November and prioritizes engagement with us,” said Jack Lobel, the national press secretary for Voters of Tomorrow. He added: “Young people have been left out of the political process for decades. So we need to take every route possible to bring them into the process.” Young voters have expressed their frustrations over Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict and his refusal to support a permanent ceasefire. And as Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail, protests have continued to follow them at appearances across the country – and, now, into the comments section. Ariana Afshar, a 27-year-old California-based content creator with more than 200,000 followers on TikTok, said the campaign’s TikTok doesn’t change the fact that he has refused to support a ceasefire in Gaza. She doesn’t plan on voting for the president. “This technique would’ve been successful, in my opinion, if he actually listened to young voters,” said. “But he doesn’t, so it’s coming off a bit phony.” Hours after Biden released his first video on the social media platform, where he weighed in on the Super Bowl and who he’ll support in the upcoming election, Israel carried out military airstrikes in Gaza as part of a hostage rescue mission, killing more than 100 people in Rafah. Claire Simon, the communications coordinator for Gen-Z for Change, a national youth-led organization that was once known as TikTok for Biden, pointed to the comments as evidence that some saw the strategy as “incredibly tone-deaf.” She pointed to the dozens of comments on the campaign’s first TikTok asking about Rafah. “It’s really a substance-over-style issue he’s having,” she said. “A lot of young people are pretty unhappy with Biden … a TikTok account isn’t really going to fix that issue for him.” Facing critics TikTok’s comment section can be a source for engagement but also a breeding ground for trolls. To date, the Biden campaign’s videos have received comments praising the president, praising Trump, questioning Biden’s mental fitness and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The campaign can ignore the spam, but needs to engage with the good faith criticisms, digital strategists say. “Once you’re on TikTok, you’re in a more one-to-one relationship with supporters,” said Kasey O’Brien, the director of social & texting at Middle Seat, a progressive strategy and consultant firm. “There will be more opportunities for him to expand on and explain his policy positions.” Creating space for negative feedback could also help the campaign show that it’s listening and taking young voters seriously, Henry said. “One thing that … young people don’t like is pandering,” she said. “An 18-year-old’s vote is worth the exact same as a 60 year old’s vote.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/mitch-mcconnell-foreign-aid/index.html,"Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell strongly defended his handling of a foreign aid package and bipartisan border security deal under heavy criticism from his right flank, saying bluntly that “every argument” against Ukraine aid is “wrong” and the opposition amounts to a “political reaction” driven by former President Donald Trump . McConnell, having just presided over one of the most tumultuous periods in his nearly two-decade tenure atop the Senate GOP, said he has occasionally in the past been “on the short side” of GOP senators – like on government funding bills and debt ceiling hikes. But in an interview with CNN in his Senate office on Wednesday, McConnell called this battle over Ukraine aid a “rare issue” where he had to get well out front of his party, which has grown increasingly resistant to helping fund the foreign war amid the ascendant isolationist wing being driven by Trump. “It’s not a question of whether I’m frustrated or not,” McConnell said when asked about the criticism he’s endured from within his own party. “I feel strongly this is in our best interest, America’s best interest and the world’s best interests to do this. … And being beat up is something I’m kind of used to after 18 years.” Over the last few weeks, McConnell blessed a bipartisan border security deal that he tried to sell to GOP senators – only to see it derailed by House Republican leaders, fellow senators and Trump himself. Then, he helped push through the Senate a $95.3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan – only to find himself in the minority of his conference when 22 of the 49 GOP senators voted to approve the plan earlier this week. Now, House Speaker Mike Johnson is threatening to shelve the bill altogether – all with Trump’s backing. The US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024. Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article How each member of the Senate voted on foreign aid package In the interview, McConnell harkened back to his childhood when his father – a foot soldier in World War II – had warned about the Russian threat, something he says has only grown more pervasive decades later. “Every argument against this is wrong. Every single one of them,” McConnell said of providing billions more to Ukraine. “Most of the money’s being spent here. Europeans have done as much, and, after the $55 billion from the EU, more than we have. Not a single American soldier has lost their lives in this fight – we’ve got a bunch of people willing to kill Russians. I can’t find any argument against this that makes any sense.” McConnell added: “So I think it’s a political reaction led, obviously, by the likely nominee for president having a view and expressing a view on this. So I think that’s why we are where we are.” Senate GOP leader’s suggestion: A House vote on aid bill McConnell’s comments come as Johnson said on Wednesday that the House would not take up the aid package, with many in his party arguing it’s time to stop pouring money into Ukraine and calling for more aggressive border security measures than the package proposed by the bipartisan group of senators and blessed by the Senate GOP leader. “The Republican-led House will not be jammed or forced into passing a foreign aid bill that was opposed by most Republican senators and does nothing to secure own border,” Johnson said Wednesday. McConnell said he wouldn’t comment on Johnson’s assertion. But he suggested that the Senate bill should get a vote on the House floor. “Whatever advice I have for the speaker I give him privately, not publicly,” McConnell said. “The only thing I’ve said publicly is we’ve heard all kinds of rumors about what the vote would be on Ukraine. Why not have it?” In the interview, McConnell downplayed the influence of the isolationist wing of his party, arguing that Republican views about the US posture in the world have long been driven by their party’s presidential candidate – something not unusual now given Trump’s positions. “Having lived as long as I have, I’ve kind of observed the party go up-and-down on foreign involvements, depending usually on who the president is, or the nominee for president, having the biggest impact on public opinion,” McConnell said. McConnell, who turns 82 next week, has not said if he would run for the GOP leadership spot after his current term concludes at the end of the year. That position could grow more complicated for the Kentucky Republican if Trump wins the presidency, given the two haven’t spoken in more than three years and they had a major falling out after the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack. McConnell non-committal on Mayorkas trial and touts Senate border deal Adding to the challenges of governing under Trump: The former president has tried to scuttle the remaining big-ticket items that McConnell has tried to approve, including on border security. Meantime, the House GOP has aligned itself closely with Trump and taken steps that have made some Republican senators uneasy – including impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the problems at the border. McConnell said he hadn’t taken a position yet on the Mayorkas trial and whether he would vote to dismiss the charges. “I haven’t really thought about it,” McConnell said, noting that Democrats would move to quickly kill the proceedings. “So I don’t think we’ll have two endless trials like we’ve had recently.” In the interview, McConnell defended his handling of the push to get a border deal, noting that Republicans had demanded one before green-lighting more Ukraine aid. And he continued to tout the border deal even though it has been heavily criticized by many in his party and ultimately collapsed. “So I picked (Oklahoma GOP Sen.) James Lankford, who’s really smart, and, as you know, they worked on it for months, came up with a product supported by the border council, the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the Washington Post editorial page,” McConnell said, calling the plan “clearly an improvement over existing law.” After Republicans said they wouldn’t support the border deal, McConnell said he “felt strongly” to move on the rest of the aid package without the immigration measures given the situation in Ukraine. Democrats have seized on the GOP decision to scuttle the border deal – something Democrat Tom Suozzi used i n his successful run in the New York special election for a US House seat on Tuesday night. But McConnell didn’t think the flap would have much of an impact on Senate races . “ I think that every one of these races will hash that out one way or another,” McConnell said. “Obviously up in New York, the Democrat did a better job of dealing with it than the Republican, and I think that’ll play out depending upon the quality of the candidates.” And he pivoted to the Senate GOP push to take back the majority: “I think we’re not going to have a candidate quality problem this cycle on our side .” On the border, McConnell added: “ I think President Biden has a real problem on this issue with or without a new law.” But unlike his House GOP counterparts, McConnell did not take aim at Biden’s memory or mental acuity after concerns were raised by Special Counsel Robert Hur’s damning report last week about his handling of classified records. “The age issue is obviously front and center for both candidates,” McConnell said when asked about the matter. “And I think they’re going to argue about it.” CNN’s Clare Foran and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/pete-hoekstra-michigan-rnc/index.html,"CNN — The Republican National Committee, along with former President Donald Trump , on Wednesday moved to end the ongoing dispute over who is the leader of the Michigan Republican Party . A panel within the Republican National Committee voted unanimously to recognize Pete Hoekstra, a former ambassador and congressman, as chair. “The committee on contests ruled that it is their belief that Karamo was removed as chair and it was recommended to the RNC executive committee to ratify Hoekstra as chair,” the RNC said in a readout. “The Executive Committee took action today to unanimously ratify Hoekstra as an RNC member as chair.” Shortly after, Trump, who had thrown his support behind Hoekstra last month, reiterated his stance. “I look forward to working with Ambassador Pete Hoekstra as Chairman of the Republican Party of Michigan,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “He is a winner who was a GREAT Congressman from Michigan and, likewise, did a fantastic job as Ambassador to the Netherlands. Pete will make The Republican Party of Michigan GREAT AGAIN, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be its Chairman —HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” Trump’s statement and the RNC ruling, together, were the strongest signs that the two most influential entities in Republican committee politics had thrown their full support behind Hoekstra and against Kristina Karamo, the embattled Michigan chairwoman who state Republicans voted to oust in January. Karamo had defied that vote and argued that it was illegitimate. Her refusal to step down left the state party in gridlock throughout much of January and during the RNC winter meeting in Las Vegas. She and Hoekstra both attended, but neither were credentialed as full voting members at the event. “Both the RNC and our Party’s presumptive nominee Donald Trump, have now both come forward and recognized me as the duly elected Chair of the Michigan Republican Party,” Hoekstra said in a statement. “It is time for the former Chair who was properly removed in accordance with the MIGOP bylaws to end her misinformation campaign and join the fight to re-elect Donald Trump rather than dividing this Party.” Karamo did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/us-navy-houthi-fight-red-sea/index.html,"On board the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower CNN — Alarms blared on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea at 4 a.m. on Tuesday morning, warning personnel to prepare for potential flight operations against a Houthi drone that was flying over nearby ships. That drone was ultimately deemed not to be a threat. But the incident demonstrated how the crew of the carrier are constantly on a heightened alert for incoming threats from the Iran-backed militants in Yemen, who have been routinely targeting commercial ships as well as US and coalition forces in the key waterway with missiles and drones. On board two vessels spearheading the US response to Houthi attacks, the Eisenhower and the US destroyer the USS Gravely in the southern Red Sea, CNN gained unique access and spoke to sailors and pilots who said the Houthi threat remains both unpredictable and unprecedented. The US Navy is working at a frenetic pace, deploying jets and firing missiles at a moment’s notice to try to destroy the Houthis’ weapons and infrastructure. But after dozens of strikes over the last month against Houthi targets both over the Red Sea and inside Yemen, CNN was told that the US military still does not know exactly how much of the Houthis’ capabilities have been destroyed—or how long it will take to deter them for good. “It’s a wicked problem set that we don’t have a lot of great fidelity on,” said Rear Admiral Marc Miguez, the commander of Carrier Strike Group Two, told CNN on Tuesday. Unlike state actors like Iran, Russia and China that the US has prioritized for intelligence collection for years, the US was not paying close attention to the Houthis before they started regularly lobbing missiles into the Red Sea, Miguez said. So the US does not know for sure how much the Houthis have stockpiled, particularly when it comes to what they have buried underground. Learning in real time The Houthis’ attacks, moreover, mark the first time anti-ship ballistic missiles have been used in combat, and the personnel on board the warships are learning in real time how to respond. “This isn’t exactly where we expected to be on this deployment,” said Captain James Huddleston, the deputy commander of Carrier Air Wing 3 who regularly flies missions over the Red Sea and Yemen. “Whenever you are doing something for the first time in a region, that’s not without risk,” Huddleston said. “But we have managed that risk to our strike group and our air crew through the management of combat power.” Dozens of fighter jets take off every day from the Ike carrier to circle the skies over the Red Sea in case they are tasked at a moment’s notice with carrying out a strike against a Houthi target. An F/A-18 with afterburner prepares to launch from the deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea. Scott Pisczek/CNN All of the jets carry air to ground missiles so they can respond immediately to a threat, Miguez said. “Unfortunately, we don’t get a lot of heads up on most of this stuff—especially the ballistic missiles,” he said. The Houthis have also changed their tactics in recent weeks, using drones more regularly to target and attack ships. “They have tried to target coalition forces, US forces, through swarm attacks, using multiple UAVs, using multiple anti-ship ballistic cruise missiles,” said Captain Marvin Scott, the commanding officer of Carrier Air Wing 3. “They are trying everything that they can, but we are prepared for anything they may throw our way.” In many cases the Houthis have been using the Samad-3 drone, Miguez said, which is long-range and carries an explosive payload. The Houthis have also been using Iranian-made drones, according to the Defense Intelligence Agency. “We know for a fact that they are a threat, so we have been taking them down more and more frequently,” he said. CNN previously reported that the US intelligence community has picked up signs that the Iranians are getting nervous about the Houthis’ attacks because of the impact they have had on some of Iran’s only allies, including China and India. Officials believe Iran was at one point using one of its suspected spy ships which has long been parked in the southern Red Sea, the Behshad, to help the Houthis target vessels there. But in a notable shift, Iran moved the ship to the coast of Djibouti earlier this month for the first time in over two years, Miguez said. That has reduced the Houthis’ capability to track ships in the Gulf of Aden, Miguez said. Seconds or minutes to respond Meanwhile, the crew on board the USS Gravely destroyer in the Red Sea are the tip of the spear against inbound Houthi missiles and drones. The sailors often only have seconds to respond to an inbound missile. “We could have seconds, or we could have minutes,” said Navy Lieutenant JG James Rodney, who works in the Gravely’s Combat Information Center. “I wouldn’t say much more than minutes.” The Gravely is equipped with long-range Tomahawk missiles that are capable of reaching targets inside Yemen. But more often, the ship is deploying its anti-air and anti-surface missiles at closer ranges as Houthi missiles and drones close in. Last month, however, a Houthi missile got so close to the Gravely—within one mile of it—that the ship had to use its last line of defense, known as the Phalanx, to take it down. That incident is now being investigated, Miguez said. The Houthis barrages have been so relentless that the Ike carrier and the destroyers deployed nearby have not made a port call in months, which is highly unusual. Sailors said the environment is stressful, but that it has helped to have a mission. “It’s definitely not what we expected, to be out here,” said FC1 Michael Zito, who helps to operate the Gravely’s 54-caliber Mark 45 gun and other weapons systems on board. “We expected to have a more relaxed and chill deployment. But this is what we’ve been training for constantly, day in and day out for years, and we’re ready for whatever else comes through.  We’ll do what needs to be done.” CNN’s Scott Pisczek contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/new-york-special-election-takeaways/index.html,"CNN — Democrat Tom Suozzi is heading back to Congress after defeating Republican Mazi Pilip in the special election to replace serial fabulist and expelled former GOP Rep. George Santos . The result will further narrow the GOP’s already thin House majority and hand President Joe Biden’s party a boost as the general election campaign comes into focus. Suozzi’s success provides Biden and national Democrats with a much-needed narrative reshuffle – a bit of good news during a period when concerns over the president’s paltry poll numbers and intensifying worries over his age, or how it’s perceived by the electorate, has stoked anxieties about the likely coming rematch with former President Donald Trump . Yes, the district broke cleanly for Biden in 2020, but Democrats on Long Island had been losing there ever since – until Tuesday. Both parties poured cash into the race for New York’s 3rd congressional district, but Democrats’ fundraising and registration advantage combined with Suozzi’s brand – he’s spent most of the last 30 years at or around the center of Long Island politics – and a fired-up base, angry over the Santos fiasco, delivered a victory that means the House GOP will now become even harder to corral. For Pilip, who has vowed to run again in the fall, defeat meant an almost immediate rebuke from Trump, who called her a “very foolish woman” in a social media post Tuesday night. Pilip refused until the final days of the campaign to say whether she voted for Trump in 2020, though she did follow his lead in dissing a highly touted bipartisan Senate border bill – a decision that helped Suozzi tie her more tightly to the former president over the last week. Video Ad Feedback Hear why Trump didn't endorse the Republican candidate to replace Santos 01:04 - Source: CNN As Democrats celebrate and Republicans dust themselves off, here are the takeaways: Immigration is a big issue – but is it a game-changer? The campaign was staked on a series of issues from the beginning: immigration, inflation, Israel and abortion. Suozzi talked about reproductive rights but didn’t make it a centerpiece of his campaign. Inflation has mostly leveled out. And there was no political or policy space to speak of between the candidates who both fully backed Israel. Understanding this, Pilip and Republicans set about hammering Suozzi over the migrant crisis in New York City, claiming he caused it along with Biden – a line that ultimately didn’t quite wash with voters who have long recognized Suozzi as a moderate or centrist. When Pilip suggested he was in league with the progressive “squad,” Suozzi at their debate was prepared. “For you to suggest I’m a member of the squad,” he said, “is about as believable as you being a member of George Santos’s volleyball team.” (And that was before a knowing reference to Rick Lazio, which only seasoned New York voters would appreciate.) Most notably, though, Suozzi and state Democratic leaders didn’t repeat their mistakes from 2022. They aggressively countered Pilip’s migrant message and it never felt like the issue, typically a winner for the GOP, put Suozzi on the backfoot. Redemption for top New York Democrats Suozzi’s win is also a major coup for the New York Democratic Party and its leaders, who came under heavy criticism from within over its candidates’ underwhelming performances in the 2022 midterms. Backed by lots of outside cash, new grassroots organizations, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his political operation, along with top state and local Democrats – Gov. Kathy Hochul and state party chair Jay Jacobs, specifically – the party simply could not allow the seat to slip away again. Not after the Santos mess, not with the entire country watching and the White House desperate for a (proxy) win. Victory has a hundred fathers, and they all did some well-deserved peacocking on Tuesday night. If not redemption, the New York Democratic Party in this special election earned a reprieve. Whether it can translate what worked – with different, perhaps weaker candidates – in the fall remains to be seen. But there’s no debating, after this result, that they’ll be given every opportunity. The weather mattered Though not for exactly the reasons one might immediately expect. It snowed heavily in the tri-state area for the first time in years Tuesday, which made travel tricky, closed schools and otherwise disrupted the normal flow of an election day. Good thing then for Democrats that, unlike many Republicans in thrall to Trump, they very much embrace the idea of early voting. As the storm swept through Queens and Long Island on Tuesday, Republican groups and the Pilip campaign scrambled to drive – literally in some cases – their voters to the polls. The top GOP House super PAC made hay on social media over spending a relative pittance on plows to clear roads in Republican-friendly areas. But if the snow didn’t really stick, it appears GOP rank-and-file distaste for banking votes early did. As yet unknown statistics will provide a clearer picture of what went wrong for Pilip, but the weather definitely clouded the picture. Democrats (still) have an Israel problem There stood Suozzi, all smiles, as he prepared to begin his victory speech, when he was interrupted by protesters accusing him of aiding and abetting a “genocide” by Israel in Gaza. Then it happened again. And again. Nevermind his rival was arguably more inclined to support Israel – she was a member of the Israel Defense Forces before moving to the US, after all – in its deadly monthslong military campaign. The interruptions were as much a message to Democrats, especially Biden, as the once and now future congressman from a heavily Jewish district. Though little will be made of a brief demonstration before a speech, the anger among progressive grassroots – young voters even more so – is real, and it is not going away. It might not add up to more votes for Republicans in the fall, but as things stand, it seems sure to eat away at Democratic support. And in an era of fine political margins, that’s a problem. Don’t take away too much This race was always going to take on national significance, both because of the stakes in the House and the makeup of the electorate, which is largely similar to suburban swing districts in presidential battleground states. But Democrats would be wise to remember that Suozzi was a unique – and uniquely talented – candidate with deep ties across Nassau County, where most of the voters reside. A former mayor, he became the first Democrat elected to the county’s top job in more than three decades when he won it in 2002. After losing his bid for a third term and some time away, he returned to become a congressman – winning the seat three times, including a defeat of Santos in 2020, before leaving for a failed gubernatorial bid in 2022. Simply stated, Suozzi had a record, and for all the ads launched against him, voters in the district knew who he was – a moderate who courts labor and will aggressively push for the return of the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, that just about everyone on Long Island wants back after Republicans jettisoned it as part of their 2017 tax cuts. It also remains to be seen how exactly the district-wide vote broke down. Suozzi appears to have exceeded expectations in Queens – a diverse borough of New York City and not a suburb – which could yet mean the town helped him as much as the country. (Democratic Rep. Grace Meng from the neighboring 6th congressional district, and the area’s Asian American voters, delivered above and beyond for Suozzi.) Pilip, on the other hand, was a relative unknown going into the race and a relative unknown coming out of it. A county legislator, she made precious few public appearances, held a handful of notable events outside the district, and seemed unsure of how to position herself in relation to Trump."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/house-intel-chairman-serious-national-security-threat/index.html,"Washington CNN — The US has new intelligence on Russian military capabilities related to its efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space, according to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence. The intelligence was briefed to Congress and key US allies, and some lawmakers say it is serious enough that it should be declassified and made public. While the intelligence is concerning, multiple senior members of Congress briefed on the information on Wednesday emphasized that it does not pose an immediate threat to the US or its interests. The system remains under development and is not yet in orbit, according to three US officials familiar with the intelligence. It’s not clear how far the technology has progressed, one of the officials said. A separate US official told CNN the threat does not involve a weapon that would be used to attack humans. It was not immediately clear whether the intelligence referred to a nuclear-powered, anti-satellite capability or a nuclear-armed capability. While members of Congress downplayed the immediacy of the threat, an anti-satellite weapon placed in orbit around Earth would pose a significant danger to US nuclear command and control satellites, said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. The US relies on such satellites – which he called “essential” – to ensure constant, seamless control over its nuclear arsenal. Other countries have tested anti-satellite weapons in the past, but this would be an escalation, Kristensen said, and the US has made clear that it would react “very forcefully” to an attack on its nuclear command and control satellites. “If it’s orbital, it’s a new level of threat [to the system], whether it’s nuclear or not,” said Kristensen, who added that even conventional weapons on an orbital anti-satellite system could pose a significant threat to the US. ABC News first reported that the intelligence related to a Russian space-based nuclear capability. Earlier Wednesday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, ignited a firestorm on Capitol Hill when he issued a cryptic statement announcing that the panel had “information concerning a serious national security threat.” In a letter to lawmakers inviting them to view the intelligence in the committee’s classified spaces, he said that it related to a “destabilizing foreign military capability that should be known by all congressional policymakers.” Immediately, lawmakers began tramping down to the House basement to learn what the intelligence was. Some left underwhelmed. One Democratic member with deep national security experience said that they had never before received that kind of urgent summons over a national security matter during their time in Congress — and that the intelligence they saw when they arrived was not urgent enough to justify Turner’s alarm-pulling. Within hours, the Republican speaker of the House, Rep. Mike Johnson, attempted to tamp down the imbroglio, telling reporters that “there is no cause for alarm” and indicating that he had known about the intelligence since at least January. “We just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We’re working on it and there’s no need for alarm,” Johnson said. Rep. Jim Himes, the committee’s top Democrat, said in a statement that “the classified intelligence product that the House Intelligence Committee called to the attention of Members last night is a significant one, but it is not a cause for panic.” National security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday said he was “surprised” that Turner had made the existence of the intelligence public, noting that he was already scheduled to brief the top Republican and Democratic leaders of the House as well as Turner and Himes on Thursday. “We scheduled a briefing for the House members of the Gang of Eight tomorrow,” Sullivan said. “That’s been on the books. So I am a bit surprised that Congressman Turner came out publicly today in advance of a meeting on the books for me to go sit with him alongside our intelligence and defense professionals tomorrow.” Turner in his statement has urged the Biden administration to declassify “all information relating to this threat so that Congress, the Administration, and our allies can openly discuss the actions necessary to respond to this threat.” Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee suggested that they had been tracking the intelligence but that it would be difficult to declassify it without exposing sensitive sources and methods. The uproar over the new intelligence comes as a $60 billion aid package to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia has stalled in the House and former President Donald Trump has been publicly supporting GOP members who have opposed the package. Trump has also in recent days said that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO allies that do not meet alliance-set spending goals on their own defense. Johnson has said that he will not bring the Senate-passed aid measure to the floor. But Turner has publicly supported continuing to fund the Ukraine war effort. Some lawmakers and US officials privately speculated that his effort to brief lawmakers on the intelligence — something the House Intelligence Committee voted on Tuesday night to do — might be an attempt to shore up flagging support for Ukraine. Sources declined to provide further detail on the intelligence or the Russian capabilities it describes. But for years, Russia has pursued counterspace systems designed to neutralize US military and commercial space systems, according to a 2022 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report on space security. Russian doctrine called for being able to target an enemy’s satellites from the ground, air, cyber and space, using attacks that range from temporary jamming to outright destruction. In 2020, Russia tested a space-based anti-satellite weapon with sophisticated orbital capabilities that could have a dual purpose: it could service and inspect friendly satellites while having the capability to attack enemy satellites. An attempt to launch a nuclear-armed anti-satellite system into space would violate The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which explicitly prohibits “any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction” in orbit.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/trump-hush-money-hearing-will-attend/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump is expected to attend Thursday’s hearing in the New York hush money criminal case, according to Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead attorney for the Georgia election subversion case. Trump had considered traveling to Georgia on Thursday for a hearing in the criminal case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis but is now planning to attend the hearing in New York, multiple sources familiar with the matter said. His expected court appearance comes just before the former president could face another consequential legal decision – this time on the fate of his business empire in New York. Both hearings are scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. ET. Fulton County DA Fani Willis appears for a hearing on November 21, 2023. Dennis Byron/Pool/Getty Images Related article Fulton County DA could be disqualified from Trump case if she financially benefitted from relationship with top prosecutor Initially, Trump was intrigued by the idea of traveling to Georgia if Willis was forced to take the stand and answer questions under oath about allegations she engaged in an improper romantic relationship with her top deputy, Nathan Wade, one of the sources told CNN. A judge on Monday did not rule out the possibility that Willis will have to testify but made clear that is contingent on what other witnesses say first. Trump’s advisers made the case that the New York hearing is more important as it is a criminal case that directly impacts him, according to a source familiar with internal discussions. Trump was charged last March with falsifying business records to commit or conceal another crime. Prosecutors allege that the former president engaged in a cover up scheme to hide reimbursement payments made to his former attorney, Michael Cohen who had paid hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public about a past affair with Trump before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges and denied the affair. The hearing in Fulton County is largely viewed by those advisers as procedural despite the possibility of Willis taking the stand and facing disqualification. As always, senior advisers warned that Trump could still change his mind last minute and decide to attend the hearing in Georgia, however that is not currently the plan. Trump civil fraud trial decision expected Friday Trump, barring unforeseen circumstances, will also learn on Friday how much the judge overseeing the civil fraud case in New York is ordering him and his real estate business to pay for fraudulently inflating financial statements for a decade, a person familiar with knowledge of the decision said. Judge Arthur Engoron initially said he hoped to issue the ruling at the end of January, following a three-month trial. Since then, the monitor overseeing the Trump Organization issued a report, and the judge inquired about news articles of a possible perjury plea deal by former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. It appears any delays caused by those two events have now been resolved. The New York attorney general’s office sued Trump alleging he engaged in a decadelong fraud by inflating the value of properties to obtain better rates on loans and insurance.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/mark-green-not-running-for-reelection/index.html,"House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green is not planning to seek reelection for his congressional seat, he announced Wednesday, in the wake of the House voting to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. “At the start of the 118th Congress, I promised my constituents to pass legislation to secure our borders and to hold Secretary Mayorkas accountable,” Green said in a statement. “Today, with the House having passed H.R. 2 and Secretary Mayorkas impeached, it is time for me to return home.” Shortly after announcing that he would not be running for reelection, Green told CNN that he had “accomplished” all that he “promised he would accomplish.” “You go out with a win,” he said. “I wanted to get a great border security bill done, we did that,” he said, referencing H.R. 2, which passed the GOP-majority House in May but is unlikely to move forward in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The Tennessee lawmaker also touted the House Republican impeachment of Mayorkas, an effort he helmed from his committee, telling CNN he had sought to “hold the administration accountable, and we just impeached for the first time a sitting cabinet secretary, who deserved it.” “I feel like there are other fights for me to get into,” he added. Green’s retirement comes as a wave of prominent House Republican lawmakers including GOP committee chairs have announced they are heading for the exits. Asked what his departure says about the state of the House Republican Conference, Green argued that any dysfunction is due to the slim margins in the House. “The other side votes their ideology, and it makes it very hard to get stuff done with a thin majority,” he said. “That’s just the way that is. What we need to do is win more seats, and have a bigger majority, and that’s what we’re going to do.” Multiple sources told CNN that Green has expressed interest in running for governor of Tennessee. Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee’s term ends in 2027. “I have come to realize our fight is not here within Washington, our fight is with Washington,” Green said in his announcement. “As I have done my entire life, I will continue serving this country – but in a new capacity.” This report has been updated with additional information.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/special-counsel-supreme-court-trump-response/index.html,"CNN — Special counsel Jack Smith pressed the Supreme Court on Wednesday to let stand a lower court ruling that denied former President Donald Trump immunity from prosecution, urging the justices to allow the trial in his election subversion case to begin quickly. “The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy,” Smith told the Supreme Court. “A president’s alleged criminal scheme to overturn an election and thwart the peaceful transfer of power to his successor should be the last place to recognize a novel form of absolute immunity from federal criminal law,” the special counsel added. Former President Donald Trump speaks outside the courtroom after testifying at New York Supreme Court, Monday, November 6, 2023, in New York. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AP Related article Trump expected to attend NY hush money hearing Thursday, lawyer says Smith’s filing was a response to an emergency request to the Supreme Court that Trump made Monday, seeking to pause proceedings so he could appeal a DC Circuit decision that denied him the ability to claim presidential immunity. Trump has argued that the “presidency as we know it will cease to exist” if the lower court’s ruling was allowed to stand. Smith’s response came days before it was due, underscoring the special counsel’s desire to rapidly move to trial. Smith argued Trump cannot meet the standard required to block the lower court’s ruling. “Delay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a speedy and fair verdict,” Smith wrote. Smith asked that if the court orders a delay that it consider the request an appeal and set the case for expedited briefing and argument. In that circumstance, Smith asked that the arguments take place next month. The special counsel’s response drew heavily on history, quoting from Alexander Hamilton and other founding-era leaders, to establish the idea that presidents should be held accountable for their conduct. He argued that Trump was unable to “point to any Founding Era suggestion of such absolute immunity,” which he said underscored “how remote the possibility is that this court will agree with his unprecedented legal position.” A unanimous opinion from the DC Circuit last week allowed Trump to face charges for actions he took to subvert the 2020 election and brushed aside his claims that former presidents are immune from such prosecution. Trump on Monday asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block that decision so he could appeal it. He has argued that denying immunity would open future presidents up to criminal prosecution as soon as they leave office. The timing of the Supreme Court’s handling of Trump’s request is critical. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, would benefit from delaying his trial until after the November election. Smith, on the other hand, is eager to not let that happen. Earlier Tuesday, Chief Justice John Roberts gave Smith until February 20 to respond to Trump’s emergency request. Trump is now expected to file a reply to Smith and the justices will decide how to proceed in short order – likely within a few days. “The public interest in a prompt trial is at its zenith where, as here, a former president is charged with conspiring to subvert the electoral process so that he could remain in office,” Smith told the court.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/jim-jordan-biden-ghostwriter-special-counsel-report/index.html,"CNN — House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan sent a letter to President Joe Biden ’s ghostwriter asking for information and an interview after special counsel Robert Hur reported that Biden shared some classified information with him in 2017, according to a letter first obtained by CNN. Jordan asked Mark Zwonitzer to turn over his audio recording of any interviews or conversations with Biden for his memoirs “Promise Me, Dad” and “Promises to Keep,” as well as all documents, communications and contracts related to his ghostwriting work that he shared with the special counsel. Jordan said he wants the materials by February 23. He also requested that Zwonitzer appear for a transcribed interview. “In light of Special Counsel Hur’s investigation and report, the Committee requires materials and information currently in your possession,” Jordan wrote. According to Hur’s report, in 2017 – after leaving the vice president’s office – Biden worked with a ghostwriter for his memoir and told the writer in a recorded conversation that he had “just found all the classified stuff downstairs,” which investigators believed referred to the home he was renting in Virginia. Investigators believed the evidence suggested Biden was referring to classified documents about the Afghanistan troop surge in 2009 – which FBI agents later found in his garage in Delaware. Hur’s report said the “best case for charges” would rely on Biden possessing classified documents in 2017, since it was after he had left the vice presidency and before he became president in 2021. But, Hur ultimately did not present any charges. In a news conference following the release of the report, the president said of the allegations of sharing classified information with his ghostwriter, “I did not share classified information, I did not share it.” The report said, “several defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.” “For example, Mr. Biden could have found the classified Afghanistan documents at his Virginia home in 2017 and then forgotten about them soon after. This could convince some reasonable jurors that he did not retain them willfully,” the report said. The report also said that the fact that Biden never talked about the documents again in the “dozens of hours” of recorded conversations with his ghostwriter, paired with how the documents were found in Biden’s garage – in a damaged box surrounded by “household detritus” – could suggest Biden had forgotten about them. “In addition, Mr. Biden’s memory was significantly limited, both during his recorded interviews with the ghostwriter in 2017, and in his interview with our office in 2023,” the report said. “And his cooperation with our investigation, including by reporting to the government that the Afghanistan documents were in his Delaware garage, will likely convince some jurors that he made an innocent mistake, rather than acting willfully – that is, with intent to break the law – as the statute requires.” Hur also said Biden’s conversations with his ghostwriter “from 2017 are often painfully slow, with Mr. Biden struggling to remember events and straining at times to read and relay his own notebook entries.” Prosecutors ultimately did not charge Zwonitzer with obstruction of justice after learning the ghostwriter deleted audio recordings he had that were of “significant evidentiary value.” The FBI was able to mostly recover the deleted files after Zwonitzer turned over his computer and external hard drive, according to the report.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/biden-palestinians-temporary-protection-deportation/index.html,"CNN — President Joe Biden granted Palestinians in the United States temporary protection from deportation amid the ongoing conflict overseas, according to a new memo Wednesday. The move comes as the White House faces immense pressure from the Arab-American community over the situation in Gaza. Late last year, Democrats urged Biden to extend temporary protections to Palestinians in the US, arguing that those already in the country “should not be forced to return to the Palestinian territories, consistent with President Biden’s stated commitment to protecting Palestinian civilians.” The president has discretion to authorize what’s known as deferred enforced departure, which protects those covered from removal from the US for a period of time. Those who qualify are also eligible for work permits. “In light of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian needs on the ground, President Biden signed a memorandum directing the deferral of removal of certain Palestinians who are present in the United States, giving them a temporary safe haven,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement Wednesday. “Specifically, President Biden is granting deferred enforced departure for 18 months to Palestinians that are currently in the United States,” the statement continued. Those convicted of felonies or who pose a public safety threat are not eligible for deferred enforced departure."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/doj-guidelines-journalists-records/index.html,"CNN — The Justice Department released new guidance Wednesday to assist federal investigators abide by department rules when attempting to access journalists’ records. The department bars employees from secretly seeking reporters’ records except in limited circumstances. Attorney General Merrick Garland codified those rules after it was revealed that the Justice Department during the Trump administration had seized records from reporters at various news organizations, including CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times. Under department rules, prosecutors are only allowed to subpoena journalists’ records in certain circumstances, including if the information they are seeking is imperative to prevent a serious crime, if the journalist themselves are the target of an investigation, if the records involve already public information or if the journalist agrees to the disclosure of their records. The guidance released Wednesday is intended to help DOJ personnel understand whether they can seek journalists records, and how they can abide by the rules if they plan to subpoena those records. “This Policy is not intended to extend special protections to members of the news media who are subjects or targets of a criminal investigation, or are parties to a civil investigation, for conduct outside the scope of newsgathering,” the guidance, posted on the department website , states. The guidance tells prosecutors to evaluate whether someone is a reporter by looking at “the frequency of the person’s or entity’s reporting and whether the person or entity brings information to the attention of the public, engages in newsgathering, has independent sources, holds press credentials, is employed by a member of the news media, and/or is widely identified as a journalist or reporter.” “The Department does not consider the ideology or viewpoint of a person or entity, or of its reporting, when determining whether that person or entity qualifies as a member of the news media for purposes of this Policy,” the guidance states. Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, praised the guidance in a statement to CNN. ﻿“The new guidance shows the commitment of DOJ leadership to further anchor within the Department the historic policy changes it put in place in 2022,” Brown said. “Those new rules better protect the watchdog role of the press and the Justice Manual provisions provide the daily details to help prosecutors carry out this objective.” This story has been updated with additional reaction."

At one point, presiding Judge Scott McAfee called a five-minute recess to apparently let tempers cool down. When court was back in session , he told lawyers to stop ""talking over each other"" and cautioned Willis, saying, ""we have to listen to the questions as asked. And if this happens again and again, I'm going to have no choice but to strike your testimony."" Willis, who was notably adverse to defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant, said she ""had some choice words about some of the things"" Merchant and her client Michael Roman — Trump's codefendant in the case — said in the motion.

Willis Thursday said she had ""some choice words"" about Roman's motion, calling some of the allegations ""dishonest"" and ""extremely offensive."" At one point, Willis held up a printed copy of the allegations against her in both hands and turned to the judge yelling, ""this is a lie!"" Willis also called defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant's interests ""contrary to democracy."" Willis took the stand following several witnesses, including Wade and Willis' former friend Robin Yeartie who testified that she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade had a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019, contradicting Willis’ prior statements to the court. Much of Willis' testimony focused on vacations she took with Wade, including Carribean cruises and visiting wine country California. Both testified that Wade routinely paid for the trips and Willis would reimburse him with cash. When repeatedly pressed about whether any records existed for her withdrawals of the funds, she said she was accustomed and taught by her father to keep 6 months of regular expenses on hand in cash. Wade took the stand earlier in the hearing. Craig Gillen, attorney for Trump co-defendant David Shafer who also asked the court to disqualify Willis, questioned Wade earlier about Willis' repayments to him for vacations that were made in cash. Wade admitted that he did not have deposit slips or receipts to support his claims. ""You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash, do you?"" Gillen asked. ""No, sir,"" Wade said. ""Not a single solitary one,"" Gillen pressed. ""Not a one."" The defense is trying to prove the existence and extent of any financial benefit to Willis from Wade from their relationship, which is the crux of their argument that Willis should be disqualified. Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade testifies during a hearing Thursday.

In 2022 specifically, Fulton County paid roughly $300,000 to his law firm. But Wade said he received roughly $100,000 because the payments were dispersed between the three people who worked at the firm, all of whom had contracts with the Fulton County DA's office for various reasons. Wade's testimony contradicts earlier bombshell revelations from a former ""good friend"" of DA Willis who testified Thursday that she has ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade had a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019, contradicting Willis’ prior statements to the court.

""You have no doubt that their romantic relationship was in effect from 2019 until the last time you spoke with her?"" Merchant questioned. ""No doubt,"" Yeartie said. Yeartie said that she and Willis met in college, and when she was employed in the district attorney's office she and Willis were ""good friends,"" but had not spoken since 2022, after Yeartie resigned from her post. Yeartie testified that she knew Willis and Wade began their relationship shortly after meeting at a conference in Nov. 2019. ""And when I say personal – romantic,"" Merchant probed. ""I just want to make sure we don't get in an argument over what personal and romantic is,"" she said.

When asked by Steve Stadow, a lawyer for former President Donald Trump, Yeartie confirmed that she observed Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November first of 2021. Yeartie testified that Willis subleased her condo starting in April 2021, which Wade claimed he visited. He also said he has never been around other members of the DA’s office at her condo. Judge McAfee said earlier in the week that depending on his findings after hearing the evidence presented from both sides, Willis could be disqualified from the case. ""In studying the law that's been filed up to this point, I think it's clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.

Immigration experts are raising the alarm about how the increasing flow of migrants illegally crossing into the U.S. may significantly impact states' representation in the House of Representatives and Electoral College. Shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden signed an executive order requiring that the U.S. Census Bureau factor in all residents, including noncitizens, as part of its decennial calculation of the U.S. population. As a result, the apportionment of House seats and, therefore, electoral votes for presidential elections, could be swayed as migrants continue to pour over the southern border. ""Illegal immigration has all kinds of effects and among them is that it distorts the mechanics of democratic government,"" Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Illegal immigrants aren't even supposed to be here, so their inclusion in the census count for purposes of apportionment really is outrageous."" ""There are a lot of close votes in Congress, more than there used to be. So, it can, in fact, make a difference,"" Krikorian said. ""It shouldn't be a question of: Does this give you personally more influence in Washington? The question should be: Is it right? Is it healthy for our democratic process to be distorted this way? The answer is no."" REPUBLICANS PROBE DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER ROLE IN HOUSING MIGRANTS ON FEDERAL LANDS On his first day in office, President Biden issued an executive order mandating that illegal immigrants are counted toward the U.S. census. (Getty Images) Overall, according to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, there are an estimated 16.8 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. as of June 2023. Therefore, because every House seat represents 761,168 residents on average, the total number of illegal immigrants account for roughly 22 seats in the House. And the most recent census, which was conducted in 2020, reduced the number of House seats apportioned to New York from 27 to 26. The state, according to the Census Bureau, would have needed just 89 more residents to maintain its previous apportionment, a calculation that highlights how fragile states' House seat levels are. REPUBLICANS ACCELERATE PROBE INTO BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S ACTIONS TO HOUSE MIGRANTS ON FEDERAL LANDS In addition, electoral votes for presidential elections are distributed to states based on how many representatives in Congress they have. Therefore, a state with a larger number of House seats has greater influence during presidential elections every four years. ""It doesn't get enough attention, and with millions coming in right now, it deserves a bright, hot spotlight,"" Lora Ries, director of the Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center, told Fox News Digital in an interview. Migrants attempting to cross into the U.S. from Mexico are detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in San Luis, Arizona. (Nick Ut/Getty Images) Earlier this month, Ries published an essay alongside RJ Hauman, the president of the Immigration Center For Enforcement, warning that illegal immigration is triggering a ""warped representation"" in Congress. ""Barring the Census from including noncitizens in apportionment is critical in making sure that American citizens — the only population who can and should vote in U.S. elections — are picking America’s leaders,"" Ries and Hauman wrote. ""Biden’s intentional border crisis has produced unprecedented apportionment issues, distorting the representation that states have in the House, and how many electoral votes they have in presidential elections."" MAYOR'S OFFICE AVOIDS SAYING WHETHER IT BACKS NONCITIZENS VOTING AFTER WARNING MIGRANT CRISIS WILL DESTROY NYC The pair argued that prohibiting the Census Bureau from counting illegal immigrants toward its apportionment population would discourage sanctuary policies in Democrat-led cities and states. They further argued that such a policy would ensure that only American citizens ""shape our political landscape"" and prevent foreign nationals from determining the political destiny of the U.S. Ries and Hauman also called for Congress to pass the Equal Representation Act, which Sens. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., Bill Cassidy, R-La., and 20 fellow Senate Republicans introduced late last month. Under the legislation, the Census Bureau would be required to include a citizenship question in any future census and prohibit noncitizens from being counted for congressional district and Electoral College apportionment. Reps. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., and Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, introduced companion legislation in the House days later. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., introduced the Equal Representation Act in January. The bill would ensure only American citizens are factored in for future House and Electoral College apportionment. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""It is unconscionable that illegal immigrants and noncitizens are counted toward congressional district apportionment and our electoral map,"" said Hagerty. ""While people continue to flee Democrat-run cities, desperate Democrats are back-filling the mass exodus with illegal immigrants so that they do not lose their seats in Congress and maintain electoral votes for the presidency and hence artificially boost their political power, which in turn dilutes the power of other Americans’ votes,"" he added. REPUBLICANS FUME AT BIDEN FOR VACATIONING AS BORDER CROSSINGS EXPLODE: 'DERELICTION OF DUTY' Hagerty's bill comes years after former President Trump attempted to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census questionnaire. Trump's effort sparked widespread criticism and condemnation from Democrats and left-wing immigration groups who argued that a citizenship question was unlawful and was designed to help Republicans in future elections. The Trump administration ultimately abandoned the effort in July 2019 after an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling. Trump said at the time that allowing noncitizens to be counted was ""part of a broader left-wing effort to erode the rights of the American citizen."" ""We will defend the right of the American people to know the full facts about the population size of citizens and noncitizens in America,"" Trump said in 2019. ""It is essential that we have a clear breakdown of the number of citizens and noncitizens that make up the U.S. populations."" (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) ""It obviously helps states that have a high illegal immigrant population. The best way to say it is it's a perverse incentive to states to grow their population through illegal immigration,"" Eric Ruark, the director of research for NumbersUSA, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Federal dollars are also based upon population. States who have a higher illegal immigrant population are going to see more federal funding."" ""To have a democratic society, you need to recognize limits on who qualifies as a citizen or as someone who has representation,"" Ruark continued.

EXCLUSIVE: Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was forced to backpedal on holding a House vote on renewing and revising a key surveillance tool of the U.S. government after a bloc of GOP lawmakers threatened a mutiny , Fox News Digital has learned. The House Rules Committee had been partially through considering a bill to renew Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) when Johnson’s spokesperson announced that a planned House-wide vote would not happen this week as expected. The Rules panel, which had to approve the bill before it hit the House floor, abruptly called off the rest of its session with no explanation. But four sources told Fox News Digital that all progress on the FISA bill would be postponed until a later date because members of the House Intelligence Committee threatened to tank a procedural vote to effectively kill the legislation. Speaker Mike Johnson was forced to scuttle an expected FISA House vote this week. (Getty Images) ""Instead of playing the game through Rules and regular order, Intel decided to take their ball and go home, walking away from the negotiated text and amendment plan without any understanding of why,"" one source said. Three more sources close to the Intelligence Committee challenged that narrative to Fox News Digital, saying the bill text was changed over the weekend without their consent or the consent of the House Judiciary Committee, which also worked on the bill. They said the issue was primarily with an amendment offered by Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus who does not sit on either committee. One of those two sources said Davidson’s amendment was not ""germane"" to the compromise text, meaning it was ineligible for consideration because it was not deemed relevant to the bill – until the text was allegedly altered over the weekend. PUBLIC TRUST IN FBI HAS REACHED 'THE RED ZONE,' US INCHING CLOSER TO 'MAYHEM, CHAOS, ANARCHY:' WSJ COLUMNIST ""Someone in leadership staff ended up drafting text that got inserted into the base text over the weekend, so they basically airdropped … this one paragraph into the base text that now makes that amendment germane,"" that source said. ""The amendment totally screws FISA, the text that was added totally screws FISA in terms of its ability to be a national security tool."" That source said taking a chance on whether Davidson’s amendment will pass was like ""playing Russian roulette."" The House Freedom Caucus is critical of the Intel Committee's FISA bill. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images) Section 702 has been both credited with preventing terror attacks on U.S. soil and accused of being a vehicle for spying on U.S. citizens. It lets the government keep tabs on specific foreign nationals outside the country without first obtaining a warrant to do so, even if the party on the other side of those communications is an American on U.S. soil . Davidson’s proposed amendment would have forced feds acting within FISA to seek a warrant before trying to obtain third-party-owned communications and location data of a U.S. citizen. The bill intended to come to the floor this week was the product of monthslong talks between the Judiciary and Intelligence panels. Both sides agreed that Section 702 needs to be reformed, and a task force of seven lawmakers was created to hash out the compromise, two sources said. Judiciary members, along with a coalition of GOP hard-liners and progressives , saw FISA as a tool abused to spy on Americans and sought severe restrictions. Intelligence Committee members argued their restrictions would have rendered it ineffective as a tool to stop terror attacks. GUN RIGHTS GROUP URGES SENATORS TO PRESS YELLEN OVER TREASURY TARGETING GUN TRANSACTIONS Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill., who is on Intelligence, agreed FISA needs reforms and defended his panel’s work on the matter but insisted the warrant aspect could hinder efforts to prevent threats to Americans. He said the committee’s proposed emphasis on more transparency and oversight of the FISA court would ""help remedy these problems and puts us on the best path forward to protect national security, and secondly, to hold the FBI accountable."" LaHood also pointed to a letter signed by Trump-era national security officials affirming support for his committee’s version of the bill. Rep. Warren Davidson's amendment is allegedly a big part of the issue. (Getty Images) ""This was airdropped in there,"" the second source close to the Intelligence Committee said of text related to Davidson’s amendment. ""This was not something that the seven members of the working group had ever digested, ever looked at. So really, it was disingenuous to think that that would be a part of that. And essentially, [House GOP leadership] agreed."" That source said Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., were ""surprised"" to hear that the legislative text was altered. The third source said, ""What they're asking for is a secondary requirement, a warrant which would be a warrant for the query of a database of already lawfully collected data … that would be the equivalent of a police officer needing a warrant before running a license plate."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., an ally of Davidson’s who supported his warrant amendment, hit back at the Intelligence Committee’s reform efforts, saying, ""Intel didn’t want the Judiciary [amendments]. See, the Judiciary Committee is the committee of jurisdiction. That’s where it should’ve gone."" But the third source close to the Intelligence Committee said those on the panel ""are the ones that see the threats to our nation up close and personal every day."" It’s not immediately clear when House GOP leaders plan to bring the bill back up. House leadership has until April 19 before Section 702 expires. Johnson’s and Davidson's offices did not immediately provide comment.

Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., suspended his bid for the Montana Senate on Thursday, telling Fox News that former President Donald Trump was a factor that led to his decision. Rosendale, a notable conservative firebrand, announced he was running for Senate on Friday, in an effort to unseat Democrat Sen. Jon Tester. Just six days later, Rosendale has withdrawn from the race as his bid stirred up the state’s Republican primary race where he was going to be challenging former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy for the nomination. Sheehy, a first-time candidate, gained endorsements from Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.; Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont.; Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte; and Trump.

The move by a New York judge to set a March 25 trial date in former President Donald Trump's hush money case is giving Republican presidential rival Nikki Haley more ammunition. ""Donald Trump is in court today. There will be a verdict on another case tomorrow. And he has a trial starting March 25. Meanwhile, he’s spending millions of campaign donations on legal fees. All of this chaos will only lead to more losses for Republicans up and down the ticket,"" Haley argued Thursday in a social media post. Haley, a former two-term South Carolina governor who later served as U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration, is the last remaining major rival challenging Trump for the GOP nomination. But she faces a steep uphill climb against Trump, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the 2024 Republican presidential race.

The former president faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York in connection with alleged hush money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels made during the 2016 presidential campaign. COURT DATES AND PRIMARIES: TRUMP FACES COMPETING CALENDARS IN 2024 Prosecutors argue the payments were an effort by Trump to hide a potential sex scandal, both before and after the 2016 election. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges, which were brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who is a Democrat. The ruling sets up the first criminal trial of a former president in the nation's history.

A real dark period."" Trump faces four trials this year, including two on charges he aimed to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Biden. ONE YEAR AFTER LAUNCHING 2024 BID, HALEY MAKES FINAL STAND AGAINST TRUMP Haley, pointing in part to Trump's legal entanglements, has repeatedly charged that Trump is ""unhinged"" and argued that ""chaos"" will follow if he returns to the White House.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-informant-charged-giving-false-information-hunter-biden-2020,"close Video Republicans believe Tony Bobulinski's interview on Hunter Biden Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on allegations about the Biden family's business dealings on 'Special Report.' Special Counsel David Weiss has charged an FBI informant with giving false information after he alleged that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden were paid millions in exchange for their help firing the Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma Holdings, according to court documents unsealed Thursday. Alexander Smirnov, 43, is charged with making a false statement and creating a false and fictitious record during FBI interviews. Hunter Biden, son of U.S. President Joe Biden, departs a House Oversight Committee meeting at Capitol Hill on January 10, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Prosecutors say Smirnov was arrested at the Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada Wednesday after a federal grand jury returned an indictment. Smirnov appeared in court in Las Vegas later Thursday where he did not enter a plea, per reporting from The Associated Press. The judge ordered the courtroom cleared after federal public defender Margaret Wightman Lambrose requested a closed hearing for arguments about sealing court documents. She declined to comment on the case. According to the indictment, Smirnov gave ""false derogatory information"" to the FBI despite ""repeated admonishments that he must provide truthful information and that he must not fabricate evidence."" The indictment says Smirnov told an FBI agent in March 2017 that he had a phone call with Burisma’s owner concerning the firm potentially acquiring a U.S. company and making an initial public offering (IPO) on a U.S.-based stock exchange. In reporting this conversation to the FBI agent, Smirnov said Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma, though this was publicly known. BIDEN, NOT SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR, BROUGHT UP SON'S DEATH IN QUESTIONING In June 2020, Smirnov is accused of having told the FBI, for the first time, about two meetings he had four to five years prior, in which executives associated with Burisma supposedly admitted that they hired Hunter Biden to ""protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."" During this meeting, the indictment alleges that Smirnov said the executives paid $5 million to each of the Bidens while Joe Biden was still in office. The indictment alleges that Smirnov falsely claimed the Bidens were paid so that Hunter Biden, with his dad’s help, could take care of a criminal investigation being conducted by the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General, Viktor Shokin, into Burisma. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, claims a Burisma executive who allegedly paid then Vice President Biden $5 million has 17 audio recordings of calls with the Bidens. (Stephen Maturen/Getty Images) The indictment alleges that this information given by Smirnov in June 2020 was a fabrication. Prosecutors say Smirnov did have contact with Burisma executives in 2017, but when Joe Biden was out of public office and had no ability to influence U.S. policy and after the Ukrainian Prosecutor General had been fired in February 2016. The indictment alleges that Smirnov transformed his ""routine and unextraordinary"" business contacts with Burisma in 2017 and later bribery allegations against Joe Biden after expressing bias against him and his presidential candidacy. FBI DIRECTOR SAYS CHINESE HACKERS ARE ‘POISED TO ATTACK’ AS INFILTRATIONS REACH ‘FEVER PITCH’ Smirnov is accused of repeating some of his false claims during an interview with FBI agents in September 2023, while changing other bits of information, and promoting a new false narrative after claiming to have met with Russian officials. If convicted, Smirnov faces a maximum of 25 years in prison. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley were approached by a whistleblower last summer who alleged that the FBI was in possession of a document — an FD-1023 form, dated June 30, 2020 — which explicitly detailed information provided by a confidential human source alleging Biden, while serving as vice president, was involved in a multi-million-dollar scheme with a foreign national in exchange for influence over policy decisions. The source told Fox News Digital that the confidential human source was used by the FBI for ""at least several years"" before the FD-1023 form, and was ""found to be highly credible "" by the FBI. Comer said Thursday that FBI Director Christopher Wray refused a request from him and Grassley last summer for the public release of the form because the bureau ""claimed it would jeopardize the safety of a confidential human source who they claimed was invaluable to the FBI."" Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., arrives for the House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing titled ""Unsuitable Litigation: Oversight of Third-Party Litigation Funding"" in Rayburn Building on Wednesday, September 13, 2023. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Comer said the bureau informed him that the source was ""credible and trusted, had worked with the FBI for over a decade, and have been paid six figures."" ""The FBI's actions in this matter are very concerning. The FBI had this form for years and it appears they did nothing to verify the troubling claims contained within the record until Congress became aware of and demanded access to them,"" Comer said. Comer said the FBI's FD-1023 form is not being used in an impeachment inquiry against the president. The impeachment inquiry, he said, ""is based on a large record of evidence, including bank records and witness testimony, revealing that Joe Biden knew of and participated in his family’s business dealings."" ""Just this week, we had another witness confirm Joe Biden was the brand being sold by the Bidens around the world. President Biden continues to lie to the American people about this matter and the American people demand the truth and accountability for any wrongdoing. We will continue to follow the facts to propose legislation to reform federal ethics laws and to determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted."" Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Grassley told Fox News Digital that the indictment ""confirms several points Senator Grassley has made repeatedly."" WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 6: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) arrives for a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on judicial nominations on Capitol Hill September 6, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) ""The informant behind the FD-1023 was, indeed, a long-serving, trusted FBI source used by the agency for criminal investigations since the Obama administration. In fact, he was so trusted that the FBI provided him authorization ‘to engage in illegal activity for investigative purposes,'"" the spokesperson said. ""But, when presented with information from a source the agency so trusted, the FBI – as exposed by Senator Grassley – sat on the document for years, without performing due diligence."" The spokesperson added: ""It’s clear that only after Senator Grassley made the FD-1023 public did the FBI investigate the allegations in the document."" Grassley has sought to ""ensure the DOJ and FBI investigated the FD-1023."" ""Today’s indictment makes clear that, without Senator Grassley’s oversight and exposure of the FD-1023, the agency would have continued neglecting its duties and failing to provide the transparency the American people deserve,"" the spokesperson said. ""Congress shouldn’t have to threaten contempt to obtain an unclassified document."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Grassley's spokesperson told Fox News Digital that ""after withholding information from Congress and the American people, and hiding behind the guise of protecting ‘sources and methods,’ the Department of Justice has now exposed their own source."" ""Accordingly, this indictment isn’t enough – the public has a right to see all the underlying evidence supporting the Biden Justice Department’s case,"" the spokesperson said. ""The Biden administration must show its work."" The FBI declined to comment when reached by Fox News Digital.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-redistricting-commission-approves-new-congressional-map,"close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for February 15 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. New York's bipartisan redistricting commission on Thursday approved a new congressional map, modifying three competitive districts but leaving the rest of the state's boundaries unchanged. The plan is likely to complicate the re-election prospects of freshman Republican Rep. Brandon Williams, whose Syracuse-centric district has taken on significantly bluer terrain. Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan and Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro, meanwhile, stand to benefit most under the new lines, with their districts being drawn into significantly bluer and redder territory, respectively. New York’s bipartisan redistricting commission approved a new congressional map Thursday that makes modest changes to three competitive districts but does not substantially change the rest of the state's lines. The map proposal now moves to the Democrat-dominated Legislature , which can approve the plan or reject it and draw its own lines. It's unclear exactly when lawmakers would meet to vote on the commission's map. New York's congressional redistricting process has been closely watched this year as suburban races in the state could have outsize influence on which party controls the House after the November elections. NY ELECTION LAW THAT 'NATIONALIZES' LOCAL POLITICS FLIES UNDER THE RADAR DESPITE BEING 'MONUMENTAL': EXPERT The redistricting commission was tasked with coming up with new districts after the state's highest court in December threw out the map used in the 2022 elections. Democrats had sued to nix the old map after their party lost a handful of suburban seats in a series of bruising defeats that helped Republicans win a narrow House majority. The panel's new map plan leaves the most of the current congressional districts largely in place, a move that could help head off legal challenges against the proposal. It also could act to sooth at least some concerns from Republicans that the new plan would leave them with a radically gerrymandered playing field for the fall. The New York state Capitol is seen prior to Gov. Kathy Hochul delivering her State of the State address in the Assembly Chamber at the state Capitol, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2023, in Albany, N.Y. (AP Photo/Hans Pennink) The most major change appears to be in the upstate district currently held by Republican Rep. Brandon Williams. The commission would shift the district, which is situated over Syracuse, to include the cities of Auburn and Cortland. The other big adjustments would be in the neighboring districts held by Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro and Democrat Rep. Pat Ryan. The plan would stretch Ryan's district north to include Woodstock, while Molinaro's district would expand to include sections of the state east of Albany. The state's Independent Redistricting Commission was supposed to draw the districts used in 2022 but failed to reach a consensus, kicking the process to state lawmakers. Democrats who control the Legislature then drew their own map, which was intended to give Democrats an edge by stuffing Republicans into a few super districts to dilute GOP voting power across the state. A lawsuit eventually stopped the Democrats' map from being used and a legal challenge delayed the congressional primaries. The state's highest court then appointed an outside expert to come up with a map for 2022. Republicans performed well under those congressional lines, flipping seats in the New York City suburbs and winning a narrow House majority. After the defeats, Democrats sued to throw out the 2022 map. The case eventually reached the state's high court, which in December ordered a new map to be drawn in a ruling that said the commission should have another chance to craft district lines. This time around, the state's redistricting commission was able to reach a consensus on a map proposal, approving a plan that did not dramatically shift district lines in an apparent effort to avoid another legal challenge that could disrupt campaigning. The panel approved the map by a vote of 9-1 during a brief hearing in Albany. The proposal leaves congressional boundaries on Long Island, where races are expected to be hotly contested, mostly unchanged, including the district formerly held by George Santos , who was expelled from Congress, and won this week by Democrat Tom Suozzi in a special election. New York City's lines also appeared largely unchanged. ""It was important for us not to enter into the process of confusing people out there over where they were going to vote,"" said redistricting commission Vice Chair Charles Nesbitt.

Members of the House and Senate usually like to gab . But word of a cryptic, major national security threat against the U.S. cast a pall on Congress this week. Loggorrheic lawmakers suddenly turned mute when they were sworn to secrecy considering the gravity of Russia potentially deploying a weapon in outer space. ""I can’t discuss this. I’m sorry,"" lamented Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla. ""Absolutely no comment,"" said Rep. Richie Torres, D-N.Y. WARNING ABOUT 'THREAT' TO US HAS 'SOMETHING TO DO WITH OUTER SPACE': CHAD PERGRAM ""We should be concerned. It’s serious,"" offered. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., ""That’s all I can say right now."" House Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La., was practically verbose when he chatted up reporters about the threat. ""I’m going to be very precise and I’m not going to take questions,"" said Johnson. But Johnson lent little detail into the disconcerting reports. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) ""Steady hands are at the wheel,"" said Johnson. ""There’s no need for alarm."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, said the White House ""confirmed that, in their view, the matter was ‘serious.’"" This consternation is cast against the backdrop of the Senate approving a $95 billion international security bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. In other words, if there’s a pressing threat from Russia, this could impact Ukraine . An eye-popping 70 senators voted in favor of the bill just before daybreak Tuesday morning. Twenty-two Senate Republicans voted yes. Three senators who caucus with the Democrats voted nay. HOUSE VOTE ON FOREIGN AID FUNDING IN LIMBO Twenty-two GOP yeas is not quite half of the 49 member Senate Republican Conference. But that’s still a substantial showing. And 70 votes is a robust figure from the Senate. Seventy yeas would make the bill hard to ignore in the House - under other circumstances. ""I think the House will face a moment of truth. This is a historical moment,"" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. ""You can also be sure our allies are watching, whether in NATO or East Asia, to see whether the United States surrenders, or betrays a partner."" Democrats demanded that Johnson take up the foreign aid bill. But he immediately resisted. ""We are not going to be forced into action by the Senate who in the latest product they sent us over does not have one word in the bill about America's border. Not one word about security,"" said Johnson. (John Moore/Getty Images) Even though Johnson – and Senate Republicans – mauled a bipartisan Senate compromise for the border. ""What is he afraid of to put national security first to help our country, to push back and push back against (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin, and to make sure that our country is protected?"" asked House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar , D-Calif. It’s not often that House members can bypass the leadership and deposit a bill on the floor. But there is a way to do it. The gambit is called a discharge petition. Here’s how it works: A discharge petition requires a solid number of 218 House members to sign up to go over the head of the Speaker. The number is locked in at 218, regardless of the side of the House. The House has 435 members at full population. It’s currently at 431 members. Thus, the discharge petition provision wants at least half of the body to favor sidestepping the leadership. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said he was ""absolutely"" for a discharge petition. When asked if most Democrats would sign on, Nadler replied, ""yeah, I do."" But not so fast. Many Democrats might push to advance the foreign aid package. But there are plenty of progressives who aren’t in favor of the bill at all because of concerns for Palestinians . RUSSIAN NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES IN SPACE COULD THREATEN INTERNATIONAL SATELLITES, US MILITARY COMMS: SOURCES ""I can’t support that bill with aid to Israel,"" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. ""There’s also a lot of concerns about the restrictions on the aid to Gaza that the Senate put into the bill, including suspending aid to UNRWA, which is the only agency that can deliver aid in Gaza."" Moreover, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., thought it was ""premature"" to execute a discharge petition. He wanted the House to try to work through the issue and get it on the floor another way. So certainly more Democrats favor of a discharge petition. But no one knows what might constitute that particular universe of votes. Therefore, a discharge petition certainly needs substantial GOP support. A successful discharge petition will require the support of advocates for Ukraine and moderate Republicans. Someone in that wheelhouse is Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. When asked if he was open to signing a discharge petition, Bacon replied ""not now."" He added he wouldn’t ""lean too far forward"" just yet. The Nebraska Republican said ""one or two"" Democrats talked to him about signing the discharge petition. But he added a caveat. ""I'm interested in finding something we could all agree on,"" said Bacon. But that’s just the start. House GOP defense hawks Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Jen Kiggans and Don Bacon are all expressing concerns about the future of foreign aid in the House. (Getty Images) ""I’d never sign a discharge petition when we are in the majority,"" said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., suggested that that signatories weren’t team players for the GOP. ""A discharge petition would be a betrayal on the part of anyone signing it,"" said Gaetz. This is why there have only been two successful discharge petitions in the House in the past 22 years. One was on the House’s version of the famous ""McCain-Feingold"" campaign finance law, named originally after late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisc., in 2002. The other was on a measure to renew the Export-Import Bank. So, this enterprise is challenging. And while it’s an intriguing parliamentary maneuver, the odds – and history – work against discharge petitions. The House is now out of session until February 28. The Senate is done until the week after next. Another (yes, another) deadline to avert a government shutdown looms on March 1. A bigger one is barreling down the tracks for March 7. And the Senate must wrestle with an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at the end of the month. In short, a resolution to the international aid bill isn’t coming soon – if ever. The threats loom – be a weapon from space for Russia. Threats at the border. Threats from China. The war in Ukraine. Instability in the Middle East. The Senate finally acted – after a months-long circumnavigation into the border talks. But there is no viable plan right now to pass the foreign aid package in the House. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It was long said that the Senate is where the House’s hot coffee cools. In this case, the Senate served the House hot coffee. And in today’s environment, it’s cooling instead in the House.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-delivers-blow-to-bidens-climate-agenda-votes-against-natural-gas-moratorium,"close Video Biden’s export suspension on liquefied natural gas could spike your heat bill Fox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the Biden administration’s controversial decision to suspend exports of liquefied natural gas. The House voted Thursday afternoon in favor of stripping the Biden administration's authority to permit natural gas export projects in a blow to the president's climate agenda. In a 224-200 vote, the House approved the so-called Unlocking Domestic LNG Potential Act , with 215 Republicans and nine Democrats voting in favor. Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, who chairs the House Energy Action Team, introduced the legislation on Feb. 1, arguing that it would ultimately overturn President Biden's recent actions pausing permits for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects. ""Just last year, President Biden told the Europeans that they needed to get off Russian gas and that the U.S. would supply their liquid natural gas needs. Now that it is an election year, he is reneging on that deal to appease his radical climate base,"" Pfluger told Fox News Digital ahead of the vote. ""Two-thirds of the world’s natural gas is produced in four countries: Russia, Iran, the United States and Qatar. This effective ban on U.S. LNG exports is a gift to Putin and the Iranian regime that just killed three service members with their weapons to the Houthis,"" the Texas lawmaker continued. ""I am proud to stand up for American jobs when the president seems to only stand up for the interests of Russia and Iran."" VULNERABLE DEM SENATOR FLIP-FLOPS ON SUPPLYING ENERGY TO CHINA IN MIDDLE OF RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN Rep. August Pfluger told Fox News Digital that President Biden's recent actions were made to ""appease his radical climate base."" (Getty Images) Pfluger also noted that Russian natural gas is 40% dirtier than U.S. gas, adding that Biden's recent moratorium on LNG exports is a ""horrible decision for the environment."" If enacted, Pfluger's bill would amend the Natural Gas Act of 1938, giving the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) exclusive authority to approve or deny applications for the siting, construction, expansion or operation of LNG export projects. And in approving or rejecting permits, FERC would be required under the bill to ""deem the importation or exportation of natural gas to be consistent with the public interest."" DOZENS OF FORMER TOP FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL ON CONGRESS TO STRIKE DOWN BIDEN'S NATURAL GAS CRACKDOWN ""Joe Biden would rather appease the radical environmentalists in his party than protect hardworking Americans. House Republicans will not stand idly by while the Biden administration’s Green New Deal agenda destroys American jobs, stifles American energy, and benefits our adversaries,"" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told Fox News Digital in a statement. Currently, FERC conducts a rigorous economic and environmental review of LNG export projects. However, following FERC's review, the Department of Energy (DOE) is tasked with determining whether such projects, which export LNG to non-free trade agreement countries, serve the national interest and giving the final approval. President Biden ordered pending natural gas export projects to be halted in a stunning move last month. The action was cheered by environmentalists who oppose fossil fuel development. (Getty Images) Late last month, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while it conducts a rigorous environmental review as part of the agency's national interest analysis, assessing the projects' carbon emissions. That review could take more than a year to complete. Energy associations, Republicans and former federal officials blasted the actions, arguing that LNG exports are critical for maintaining low energy prices in the U.S., helping American allies to wean off Russian gas and decreasing global carbon emissions. They have noted that, in December 2023, more than 87% of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe, U.K. or Asian markets previously reliant on Russia. STATE AGS WARN BIDEN'S NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW, DEMAND REVERSAL ""Allies and trading partners around the world rely on clean, reliable, and affordable U.S. natural gas for energy and economic security, and to advance environmental progress through emission reductions,"" said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute, which endorsed the Unlocking Domestic LNG Potential Act. ""With Europe still relying on Russia for nearly 15% of its natural gas consumption, and global demand expected to increase for several decades, continued expansion of U.S. export capacity is essential to American interests,"" Durbin added. Rep. Frank Pallone said the Unlocking Domestic LNG Potential Act would benefit China. However, a small fraction of U.S. LNG exports are sent to the Chinese market. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) But environmental activist groups and Democrats have criticized the legislation, arguing that stripping DOE of its authority to permit LNG exports would exacerbate climate change and mainly benefit Chinese industry. ""Make no mistake: if this bill ever became law, Americans would pay more for the gas that heats their homes and keeps their lights on. It is an affront to middle-class families who cannot afford to deal with more fossil fuel price volatility,"" remarked House Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone, D-N.J., who said the bill would ""enrich China."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to the most recent federal data, though, just 6.7% of U.S. LNG exports are shipped to China. The vast majority of exports are sent to Europe, which has relied on U.S. natural gas to wean itself off Russian energy amid the Ukraine war, and other Asian countries like Japan and South Korea. The legislation now makes its way to the Senate, where Sen. Tim Scott , R-S.C., Banking Committee ranking member, introduced companion legislation alongside 16 fellow Republicans. The White House, however, said Biden would veto the bill if it was passed. ""The Administration believes that the critical protections current law provides, which this legislation would repeal, should be retained to protect residential and industrial consumers and national and domestic energy security,"" the White House said Tuesday.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vances-office-doubles-down-on-impeachment-time-bomb-foreign-aid-package,"close Video Foreign aid package comes as Ukraine war enters third year of fighting Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin breaks down the $95 billion foreign aid package approved by the Senate. FIRST ON FOX: Sen. JD Vance's office will send a letter to GOP lawmakers Thursday doubling down on the claim that the Ukraine-Israel-Taiwan foreign aid package contains an ""impeachment time bomb"" that would tie the hands of the next administration. Vance's memo comes a day after former Vice President Mike Pence' s policy think tank, Advancing American Freedom (AAF), sent a memo to senators dismissing Vance's claims. The national security supplemental text assures the delivery of $1.6 billion to finance Ukraine's military as well as just under $14 billion for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative through Sept. 30, 2025 – the same aid mechanism that Trump temporarily paused while pushing for an investigation into Biden family foreign business dealings. MIKE PENCE'S THINK TANK PUSHES BACK ON JD VANCE'S 'IMPEACHMENT TIME BOMB' CLAIM IN FOREIGN AID PACKAGE Republican candidate for U.S. Senate JD Vance speaks at a campaign rally at the Dayton International Airport on November 7, 2022 in Vandalia, Ohio. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) AAF claimed Wednesday that it's the president’s duty to faithfully execute the law as ""written into the Constitution"" — known as the Take Care clause — rejecting the argument made by the Nixon administration that the clause ""empowered the President to ignore federal statutes."" Vance's office said AAF was actually supporting their point that the Ukraine supplemental would tie Trump's hands if he returns to the White House. ""Therefore, they advance the claim that a future president would have a constitutional responsibility to 'faithfully execute the law' that requires him to fund Ukraine well into his second term or face a (fake) claim of a constitutional/legal violation,"" Vance's office wrote in the new memo. ""That is exactly the claim advanced by the Ukraine Supplemental Impeachment Time Bomb."" ""Administration officials have been transparent about efforts to tie the hands of a future presidential administration, with one revealing to the Washington Post that this supplemental bill is a key component of their plan to ‘future-proof aid for Ukraine against the possibility that former president Donald Trump wins his reelection bid,’"" the memo continued. ""Former senior administration officials, including a former director of the Office of Management and Budget, have validated that this supplemental bill may function as a ""secret set of handcuffs"" and that opponents of a future president’s Ukraine policy 'will use this to try and tie his hands in the initial weeks of his presidency.'""

(Rachel Mummey/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Meanwhile, AAF noted in their memo if the president wants to cut off federal aid to Ukraine, he must get approval from Congress in a 45-day timeframe, ""otherwise he must dutifully execute the law as written."" Vance's office said that rebuttal actually ""reinforces"" their position ""that this supplemental would tie a future president’s hands on spending in Ukraine or he would risk impeachment from Democrats on the same absurd grounds as President Trump’s first impeachment."" The Trump administration, through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), withheld a total of about $400 million in security assistance from Ukraine in 2019. This came just before Trump asked Ukrainian President Voldomyr Zelenskyy to investigate the family of his 2020 rival, Joe Biden, and while the White House allegedly was withholding an Oval Office visit from Zelenskyy in exchange for an investigation. These actions are what fueled the impeachment effort against Trump, in which he was ultimately acquitted. Vance's memo argues previous Ukraine supplemental bills lacked sunset dates extending into future administrations. The Biden administration requested specific sunset dates in the current bill to extend aid into the next presidential term, which was granted despite most Senate Republicans voting against it. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Marc Short, AAF board chairman said ""AAF will side with the Constitution on the powers given to Congress and the Executive Branch over Senator Vance's conspiracies any day.""

Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said the provision in the bill ""is gonna force him to send money and spend money for Ukraine."" ""This is in the bill,"" Tuberville told Fox News Digital. ""So, it's just another situation where the Democrats are doing something and working towards making sure that money's spent in a certain area where American taxpayers and this country don't have."" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, also agreed with Vance and claimed that Democrats are ""setting up"" for a possible Trump presidential win. Jamie Joseph is a writer who covers politics.

What's Happening? - Fulton County DA Fani Willis shocks in raucous courtroom testimony - Date set for first Trump criminal trial - Nearly half of Americans think Biden should be replaced as Dem nominee Fulton County DA Fani Willis (Getty Images) Embattled Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis took the stand to testify against allegations she had an ""improper"" affair with special prosecutor Nathan Wade , which could derail her case against former President Donald Trump. Willis was notably agitated and at points raised her voice during a raucous several hours of testimony. At one point, Willis held up a printed copy the allegations against her in both hands and turned to the judge yelling, ""it is a lie!"" Willis also called defense attorney Ashleigh Merchan's interests ""contrary to democracy."" Judge Scott McAfee presiding over the proceeding, called for a five-minute recess at one point. When court was back in session he told lawyers to stop ""talking over each other"" and cautioned Willis, saying: ""We have to listen to the questions as asked. And if this happens again and again, I'm going to have no choice but to strike your testimony."" Willis is expected back on the stand Friday for further testimony. Trump had his own courtroom drama Thursday. He appeared in a Manhattan court for a pretrial hearing in the criminal ""hush-money"" case against him, where the judge set a date for the beginning of the first trial on criminal charges. The trial is set to start March 25, a few weeks after Super Tuesday but before the end of the GOP primary. Trump said he would be campaigning in the evening after attending the trial. ""I'll be here during the day and I'll be campaigning during the night. Biden should be doing the same thing but he’ll be sleeping,"" Trump said outside the courtroom.

What's Happening? - House Republican warns of serious national security threat related to space - Mayorkas becomes first cabinet secretary to be impeached since the 19th century - Democrat Tom Suozzi triumphs in special election to replace Santos Mayorkas impeachment succeeds by one vote U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas speaks to the media about an overview of public safety plans for Super Bowl week at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center on February 07, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Candice Ward/Getty Images) On the eve of Valentine's Day and Ash Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was impeached in a historic vote over his mishandling of the illegal immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. T hree Republican lawmakers, Reps. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., Ken Buck, R-Colo., and Tom McClintock, R-Calif., jumped the aisle to vote against the impeachment. The 214-213 vote came after the first impeachment failed earlier this month. Every House Democrat showed up to protect the cabinet secretary, including Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who temporarily left the hospital where he was recovering from surgery to cast his vote. Once Rep. Steve Scalise returned to D.C. from a cancer treatment, the GOP had the numbers to advance the articles of impeachment. House Republicans have accused Mayorkas of violating his oath to defend the U.S. by failing to secure the border and ""refusing"" to enforce immigration laws. The three Republicans who voted against impeachment on Tuesday have criticized Mayorkas' handling of the border but expressed reservations over whether it rose to the level of impeachment. McClintock warned it could set a precedent for political impeachments that could harm Republican officials in the future. This is the first time a Cabinet secretary has been impeached by the U.S. Congress since 1876. It's now up to the Senate — where Democrats run the show — to hold an impeachment trial. Reps.

What's Happening? - Ex-Hunter Biden associate testifies to House panel - House prepares to vote on Biden border chief impeachment - New York's 3rd district voting on a replacement for ex-Rep George Santos Who could step up? Democrats have overwhelmingly backed President Biden's 2024 re-election. But the damaging report released last week by Special Counsel Robert Hur has breathed new life into the belief that the party will ultimately replace him as nominee ahead of the 2024 general election. From left to right: California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former First Lady Michelle Obama, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, and Vice President Kamala Harris. (Getty Images) Here are five of the top names being mentioned as a potential replacement for Biden should he decide — or is pressured — not to run for a second term: 1. California Gov. Gavin Newsom Democrat strategists and members of the media continually mention him as a future presidential hopeful, but that future could come sooner rather than later should Biden's plans change. 2. Vice President Harris Harris' presidential ambitions have been known since her first unsuccessful run for the White House in 2020, when she failed to gain support over her Democrat primary opponents, including Biden. Despite her low approval rating and frequent gaffes as vice president, she continues to insist she's ""ready to serve"" as commander in chief, if necessary. 3. Former first lady Michelle Obama Obama has been one of the more surprising names floated as a potential replacement for Biden, considering her lack of political experience. But she remains popular to Democrats, and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy keeps floating the possibility. 4. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Despite declining a run for the White House , Whitmer appeared to leave the door open for a future presidential run after her convincing re-election win during the 2022 midterm elections, a year that was expected to be a difficult one for Democrats. 5. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear Beshear has been seen as a rising star within the party given his status as one of the most popular governors in the country, despite being a Democrat leading a red state. That status grew following a big re-election win last year over then-Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who was considered a rising GOP star.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-win-seat-republicans-win-impeachment-two-presidents-clash-over-nato,"close Video Dems flipping NY House seat threatens GOP majority Fox News’ Bryan Llenas reports on Democrat Tom Suozzi's victory in the New York special election to fill former Rep. George Santos’ seat. If the second attempt to impeach the Homeland Security chief had taken place a short time later, the Republicans would have failed again. Instead, they managed to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas–the first sitting Cabinet secretary to draw that sanction–by a single vote. But after a victory in George Santos’ old district, the Democrats would have had the extra vote to stop the impeachment. TRUMP’S NATO COMMENTS TRIGGER FIERCE MEDIA AND EUROPEAN OPPOSITION: HOW SERIOUS IS HE? Tom Suozzi beat Republican Mazi Pilip in Tuesday’s special election on Long Island, unleashing a tidal wave of punditry about his winning formula–openly tackling such issues as illegal migration and crime rather than avoiding them. I always caution against drawing sweeping conclusions in one-off local races, and this election in a snowstorm is no exception. Former U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi, Democratic candidate for New York's 3rd congressional district, speaks at his election night party Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2024, in Woodbury, N.Y. (AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah) The underlying factor was Santos, the outlandish, lying, fabricating lawmaker who won the seat with a made-up resume, was expelled by the House and is under indictment. Voters felt hosed by the Republican publicity hound, and maybe the Dems were more motivated to vote. Sure, Suozzi deserves credit for seizing on illegal migration and crime rather than avoiding such explosive issues – and doggedly distancing himself from President Biden. But he also has to run again in the fall. NATO CHIEF SAYS TRUMP CRITICISM 'DOES UNDERMINE THE SECURITY OF ALL OF US' Trump, for his part, blamed Pilip, ""running in a race where she didn’t endorse me and tried to ‘straddle the fence,’ when she would have easily WON if she understood anything about MODERN DAY politics in America…I STAYED OUT OF THE RACE, ‘I WANT TO BE LOVED!’"" A subtle Valentine’s Day message?

Donald Trump won the key New Hampshire primary Tuesday, moving him ever closer to locking in the Republican presidential nomination and securing an extraordinary White House rematch with Joe Biden. (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)) The move against Mayorkas, the first against a Cabinet officer in 150 years, is about the politics of symbolism. Republicans know full well the Democratic-controlled Senate is not going to convict him. This was about keeping the spotlight on one of the GOP’s best issues . But if the press saddled Johnson with a humiliating defeat last week, it has to credit him with a big win now. Both episodes shed light on the fractious politics of the Hill. Just when it looked like the Senate might pass a bipartisan border security bill–which included military aid to Ukraine and Israel–Donald Trump ripped it and the package was dead. YOU DON'T NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM TO SECURE THE BORDER: MARC THIESSEN Now the Senate appears ready to pass a stand-alone military aid bill by a filibuster-proof majority. But Johnson says he won’t bring it up for a House floor vote. That would bury it, unless a handful of Republicans join with Democrats to force a vote through a discharge petition. Think about it: the United States, unable to help two major allies because of election-year politics, especially Ukraine, which remains under siege by Vladimir Putin. And that’s why Biden took the rare step of delivering a televised speech on Tuesday. His predecessor gave him an opening by saying he wouldn’t protect any NATO member who didn’t pay its fair share in military costs. And if that were the case, Putin and Russia could ""do whatever the hell they want."" WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 13: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks on the Senate's recent passage of the National Security Supplemental Bill, which provides military aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 13, 2024, in Washington, DC. During his remarks Biden urged House Republicans and U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) to move the legislation through the House of Representatives. (Anna Moneymaker) Biden, in his speech , accused Trump of siding with the Russian dictator, calling the comments ""dumb,"" ""shameful,"" ""dangerous"" and ""un-American."" Put aside whether Biden is right or Trump is trying to pressure delinquent allies. Joe Biden passed up a softball Super Bowl interview. So why is he getting in front of the cameras now? One, he’s trying to get push Congress to pass the military aid bill. Two, he’s trying to change the subject from his own questionable memory in that wake of that stinging special counsel’s report. Three, he is finally heeding the advice of those who say he needs to do more television to prove his competence and dim the focus on every gaffe or misstatement. What’s fascinating is the spin of each party when it comes to backing their candidate. Democrats are hitting the airwaves saying Biden is sharp and laser-focused in private, and counsel Robert Hur has no business airing his personal criticism of the president’s mental acuity. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republicans are saying Trump would not actually abandon NATO and that he doesn’t mean what he’s saying.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nato-comments-trigger-fierce-media-european-opposition-how-serious-he,"close Video The media doesn’t allow the public to hear what Trump has to say: Robby Soave Reason senior editor Robby Soave and Democratic strategist Ameshia Cross join ‘MediaBuzz’ to discuss the Supreme Court appearing to tilt towards Trump in the Colorado ballot case. Donald Trump has made some news that is reverberating around the world. It wasn’t him saying – after that incredible Super Bowl comeback by Kansas City – that he signed a law boosting earnings for musicians so Taylor Swift shouldn’t endorse Joe Biden (also ""I like her boyfriend, Travis""). It wasn’t ""we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country, we will rout the Fake News Media, we will Drain the Swamp."" It’s not that he told a South Carolina rally that "" Biden's thugs are still trying to put me in jail on fake charges for crimes that they openly admit that Crooked Joe did. He actually did these crimes"" – while adding ""I’m not looking for anything to happen to this guy."" WHY BIDEN’S ANGER AND DEFENSIVENESS INFLAMED ANXIETY ABOUT HIS MEMORY ISSUES No, it’s about NATO. Trump recalled a conversation with the president ""of a big country,"" who he says asked him if they didn’t increase their defense contribution to the North Atlantic alliance ""and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?"" Sharing his response at the rally, Trump claims he said: ""You didn’t pay. You’re delinquent… No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want."" The idea that Vladimir Putin could do ""whatever the hell they want"" set off alarm bells, not only among foreign policy officials in Europe but in much of the mainstream media here at home. One potential impact would be on Ukraine, with Trump having declined to endorse more military aid to that weakened country, which would allow Russia’s unprovoked invasion to succeed in either keeping its territorial gains along the eastern border or capturing the entire sovereign nation. And yet there is further evidence, as if any were needed, that the GOP is now Trump’s party. Some of the biggest Republican hawks, who staunchly supported NATO in the past, say they have no problem with the former president’s remarks. Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump during a Get Out The Vote rally at Coastal Carolina University on Feb. 10 in Conway, South Carolina. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) As the Washington Post points out, Lindsey Graham said when he ran for president in 2016 that Trump’s comments had made Putin a ""very happy man."" On Sunday, the senator said he was ""not worried"" about Trump’s latest remarks ""at all."" Tom Cotton, another leading hawk, said in 2016 that America must ""make sure that we stand by NATO and we stand for countries like Ukraine and Georgia"" who face ""Russian aggression, and recognize Vladimir Putin as the adversary he is."" On Sunday, the senator said NATO countries not paying their full share are ""already encouraging Russian aggression, and President Trump is simply ringing the warning bell."" UKRAINE AID PACKAGE WOULD BE USED TO IMPEACH TRUMP, SEN VANCE WARNS Marco Rubio said in 2018 that Trump went too far by ""questioning the value of the alliance,"" tweeting: ""The end of #NATO would be a dream come true for #Putin."" On Sunday, the senator said he had ""zero"" concerns about Trump’s latest comments and suggested he didn’t mean them: ""We’ve already been through this. ""You would think people would’ve figured it out by now."" And here’s the kicker: Rubio and Graham pushed through a bill barring any president from withdrawing from NATO. I wonder who they might have had in mind? Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump walks out to speak at a Get Out The Vote campaign rally held at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, South Carolina, on Feb 10. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Look, I get it. This is how Trump negotiates. During his first term he regularly questioned the value of the NATO alliance as a way of getting some country to keep their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, with some success. It’s an approach he honed as a businessman when he would threaten to walk away from a deal unless certain conditions were met. But when Trump took office with little experience in foreign policy, he was talked out of any withdrawal by such retired generals as Jim Mattis and John Kelly. The New York Times reports this anecdote: ""Soon after former President Donald J. Trump took office, his staff explained how NATO’s mutual defense obligations worked. ""‘You mean, if Russia attacked Lithuania, we would go to war with Russia?’ he responded. ‘That’s crazy.’ Mr. Trump has never believed in the fundamental one-for-all-and-all-for-one concept of the Atlantic alliance."" But Trump has made clear that in a second term he would surround himself with loyalists who would not attempt to stop such decisions. Senior adviser Jason Miller says Biden has reversed Trump’s approach to NATO: ""Democrat and media pearl-clutchers seem to have forgotten that we had four years of peace and prosperity under President Trump, but Europe saw death and destruction under Obama-Biden and now more death and destruction under Biden."" FINLAND CENTER-RIGHT CANDIDATE ALEXANDER STUBB DECLARES PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY WITH NEARLY 52% OF VOTE Much of the media are leading the charge on NATO. CNN’s Christiane Amanpour called Trump’s latest comments ""insane."" It’s also true that top European officials are being quoted on the record as criticizing Trump’s language. They would be irresponsible if they didn’t start plotting a Plan B. European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 28, 2022. (REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo) The crux of the argument is that the alliance created in the wake of World War II has worked well in deterring war and doesn’t need to be fixed. I happen to be in that camp – and the only time the mutual defense pact has been invoked was when our allies aided us after the Sept. 11 attacks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Yet it’s also true that Trump is well practiced in making seemingly over-the-top pronouncements that give him more leverage.
