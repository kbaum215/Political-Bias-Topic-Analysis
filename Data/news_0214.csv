cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/house-intel-chairman-serious-national-security-threat/index.html,"Washington CNN — The US has new intelligence on Russian military capabilities related to its efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space, according to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence. The intelligence was briefed to Congress and key US allies, and some lawmakers say it is serious enough that it should be declassified and made public. While the intelligence is concerning, multiple senior members of Congress briefed on the information on Wednesday emphasized that it does not pose an immediate threat to the US or its interests. The system remains under development and is not yet in orbit, according to three US officials familiar with the intelligence. It’s not clear how far the technology has progressed, one of the officials said. A separate US official told CNN the threat does not involve a weapon that would be used to attack humans. It was not immediately clear whether the intelligence referred to a nuclear-powered, anti-satellite capability or a nuclear-armed capability. While members of Congress downplayed the immediacy of the threat, an anti-satellite weapon placed in orbit around Earth would pose a significant danger to US nuclear command and control satellites, said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. The US relies on such satellites – which he called “essential” – to ensure constant, seamless control over its nuclear arsenal. Other countries have tested anti-satellite weapons in the past, but this would be an escalation, Kristensen said, and the US has made clear that it would react “very forcefully” to an attack on its nuclear command and control satellites. “If it’s orbital, it’s a new level of threat [to the system], whether it’s nuclear or not,” said Kristensen, who added that even conventional weapons on an orbital anti-satellite system could pose a significant threat to the US. ABC News first reported that the intelligence related to a Russian space-based nuclear capability. Earlier Wednesday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, ignited a firestorm on Capitol Hill when he issued a cryptic statement announcing that the panel had “information concerning a serious national security threat.” In a letter to lawmakers inviting them to view the intelligence in the committee’s classified spaces, he said that it related to a “destabilizing foreign military capability that should be known by all congressional policymakers.” Immediately, lawmakers began tramping down to the House basement to learn what the intelligence was. Some left underwhelmed. One Democratic member with deep national security experience said that they had never before received that kind of urgent summons over a national security matter during their time in Congress — and that the intelligence they saw when they arrived was not urgent enough to justify Turner’s alarm-pulling. Within hours, the Republican speaker of the House, Rep. Mike Johnson, attempted to tamp down the imbroglio, telling reporters that “there is no cause for alarm” and indicating that he had known about the intelligence since at least January. “We just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We’re working on it and there’s no need for alarm,” Johnson said. Rep. Jim Himes, the committee’s top Democrat, said in a statement that “the classified intelligence product that the House Intelligence Committee called to the attention of Members last night is a significant one, but it is not a cause for panic.” National security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday said he was “surprised” that Turner had made the existence of the intelligence public, noting that he was already scheduled to brief the top Republican and Democratic leaders of the House as well as Turner and Himes on Thursday. “We scheduled a briefing for the House members of the Gang of Eight tomorrow,” Sullivan said. “That’s been on the books. So I am a bit surprised that Congressman Turner came out publicly today in advance of a meeting on the books for me to go sit with him alongside our intelligence and defense professionals tomorrow.” Turner in his statement has urged the Biden administration to declassify “all information relating to this threat so that Congress, the Administration, and our allies can openly discuss the actions necessary to respond to this threat.” Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee suggested that they had been tracking the intelligence but that it would be difficult to declassify it without exposing sensitive sources and methods. The uproar over the new intelligence comes as a $60 billion aid package to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia has stalled in the House and former President Donald Trump has been publicly supporting GOP members who have opposed the package. Trump has also in recent days said that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO allies that do not meet alliance-set spending goals on their own defense. Johnson has said that he will not bring the Senate-passed aid measure to the floor. But Turner has publicly supported continuing to fund the Ukraine war effort. Some lawmakers and US officials privately speculated that his effort to brief lawmakers on the intelligence — something the House Intelligence Committee voted on Tuesday night to do — might be an attempt to shore up flagging support for Ukraine. Sources declined to provide further detail on the intelligence or the Russian capabilities it describes. But for years, Russia has pursued counterspace systems designed to neutralize US military and commercial space systems, according to a 2022 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report on space security. Russian doctrine called for being able to target an enemy’s satellites from the ground, air, cyber and space, using attacks that range from temporary jamming to outright destruction. In 2020, Russia tested a space-based anti-satellite weapon with sophisticated orbital capabilities that could have a dual purpose: it could service and inspect friendly satellites while having the capability to attack enemy satellites. An attempt to launch a nuclear-armed anti-satellite system into space would violate The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which explicitly prohibits “any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction” in orbit.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/trump-hush-money-hearing-will-attend/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump is expected to attend Thursday’s hearing in the New York hush money criminal case, according to Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead attorney for the Georgia election subversion case. Trump had considered traveling to Georgia on Thursday for a hearing in the criminal case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis but is now planning to attend the hearing in New York, multiple sources familiar with the matter said. His expected court appearance comes just before the former president could face another consequential legal decision – this time on the fate of his business empire in New York. Both hearings are scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. ET. Fulton County DA Fani Willis appears for a hearing on November 21, 2023. Dennis Byron/Pool/Getty Images Related article Fulton County DA could be disqualified from Trump case if she financially benefitted from relationship with top prosecutor Initially, Trump was intrigued by the idea of traveling to Georgia if Willis was forced to take the stand and answer questions under oath about allegations she engaged in an improper romantic relationship with her top deputy, Nathan Wade, one of the sources told CNN. A judge on Monday did not rule out the possibility that Willis will have to testify but made clear that is contingent on what other witnesses say first. Trump’s advisers made the case that the New York hearing is more important as it is a criminal case that directly impacts him, according to a source familiar with internal discussions. Trump was charged last March with falsifying business records to commit or conceal another crime. Prosecutors allege that the former president engaged in a cover up scheme to hide reimbursement payments made to his former attorney, Michael Cohen who had paid hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public about a past affair with Trump before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges and denied the affair. The hearing in Fulton County is largely viewed by those advisers as procedural despite the possibility of Willis taking the stand and facing disqualification. As always, senior advisers warned that Trump could still change his mind last minute and decide to attend the hearing in Georgia, however that is not currently the plan. Trump civil fraud trial decision expected Friday Trump, barring unforeseen circumstances, will also learn on Friday how much the judge overseeing the civil fraud case in New York is ordering him and his real estate business to pay for fraudulently inflating financial statements for a decade, a person familiar with knowledge of the decision said. Judge Arthur Engoron initially said he hoped to issue the ruling at the end of January, following a three-month trial. Since then, the monitor overseeing the Trump Organization issued a report, and the judge inquired about news articles of a possible perjury plea deal by former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. It appears any delays caused by those two events have now been resolved. The New York attorney general’s office sued Trump alleging he engaged in a decadelong fraud by inflating the value of properties to obtain better rates on loans and insurance. They also allege Trump and others violated numerous other New York laws related to the issuance of false financial statements. The state is seeking more than $370 million and to ban Trump from doing business in New York state . They are also seeking to ban his two adult sons from running a business in the state for five years. Trump and his adult sons have denied any wrongdoing and said no one was harmed by the alleged fraud. This story has been updated with additional information.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/mark-green-not-running-for-reelection/index.html,"House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green is not planning to seek reelection for his congressional seat, he announced Wednesday, in the wake of the House voting to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. “At the start of the 118th Congress, I promised my constituents to pass legislation to secure our borders and to hold Secretary Mayorkas accountable,” Green said in a statement. “Today, with the House having passed H.R. 2 and Secretary Mayorkas impeached, it is time for me to return home.” Shortly after announcing that he would not be running for reelection, Green told CNN that he had “accomplished” all that he “promised he would accomplish.” “You go out with a win,” he said. “I wanted to get a great border security bill done, we did that,” he said, referencing H.R. 2, which passed the GOP-majority House in May but is unlikely to move forward in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The Tennessee lawmaker also touted the House Republican impeachment of Mayorkas, an effort he helmed from his committee, telling CNN he had sought to “hold the administration accountable, and we just impeached for the first time a sitting cabinet secretary, who deserved it.” “I feel like there are other fights for me to get into,” he added. Green’s retirement comes as a wave of prominent House Republican lawmakers including GOP committee chairs have announced they are heading for the exits. Asked what his departure says about the state of the House Republican Conference, Green argued that any dysfunction is due to the slim margins in the House. “The other side votes their ideology, and it makes it very hard to get stuff done with a thin majority,” he said. “That’s just the way that is. What we need to do is win more seats, and have a bigger majority, and that’s what we’re going to do.” Multiple sources told CNN that Green has expressed interest in running for governor of Tennessee. Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee’s term ends in 2027. “I have come to realize our fight is not here within Washington, our fight is with Washington,” Green said in his announcement. “As I have done my entire life, I will continue serving this country – but in a new capacity.” This report has been updated with additional information.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/special-counsel-supreme-court-trump-response/index.html,"CNN — Special counsel Jack Smith pressed the Supreme Court on Wednesday to let stand a lower court ruling that denied former President Donald Trump immunity from prosecution, urging the justices to allow the trial in his election subversion case to begin quickly. “The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy,” Smith told the Supreme Court. “A president’s alleged criminal scheme to overturn an election and thwart the peaceful transfer of power to his successor should be the last place to recognize a novel form of absolute immunity from federal criminal law,” the special counsel added. Former President Donald Trump speaks outside the courtroom after testifying at New York Supreme Court, Monday, November 6, 2023, in New York. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AP Related article Trump expected to attend NY hush money hearing Thursday, lawyer says Smith’s filing was a response to an emergency request to the Supreme Court that Trump made Monday, seeking to pause proceedings so he could appeal a DC Circuit decision that denied him the ability to claim presidential immunity. Trump has argued that the “presidency as we know it will cease to exist” if the lower court’s ruling was allowed to stand. Smith’s response came days before it was due, underscoring the special counsel’s desire to rapidly move to trial. Smith argued Trump cannot meet the standard required to block the lower court’s ruling. “Delay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a speedy and fair verdict,” Smith wrote. Smith asked that if the court orders a delay that it consider the request an appeal and set the case for expedited briefing and argument. In that circumstance, Smith asked that the arguments take place next month. The special counsel’s response drew heavily on history, quoting from Alexander Hamilton and other founding-era leaders, to establish the idea that presidents should be held accountable for their conduct. He argued that Trump was unable to “point to any Founding Era suggestion of such absolute immunity,” which he said underscored “how remote the possibility is that this court will agree with his unprecedented legal position.” A unanimous opinion from the DC Circuit last week allowed Trump to face charges for actions he took to subvert the 2020 election and brushed aside his claims that former presidents are immune from such prosecution. Trump on Monday asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block that decision so he could appeal it. He has argued that denying immunity would open future presidents up to criminal prosecution as soon as they leave office. The timing of the Supreme Court’s handling of Trump’s request is critical. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, would benefit from delaying his trial until after the November election. Smith, on the other hand, is eager to not let that happen. Earlier Tuesday, Chief Justice John Roberts gave Smith until February 20 to respond to Trump’s emergency request. Trump is now expected to file a reply to Smith and the justices will decide how to proceed in short order – likely within a few days. “The public interest in a prompt trial is at its zenith where, as here, a former president is charged with conspiring to subvert the electoral process so that he could remain in office,” Smith told the court.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/us-navy-houthi-fight-red-sea/index.html,"On board the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower CNN — Alarms blared on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea at 4 a.m. on Tuesday morning, warning personnel to prepare for potential flight operations against a Houthi drone that was flying over nearby ships. That drone was ultimately deemed not to be a threat. But the incident demonstrated how the crew of the carrier are constantly on a heightened alert for incoming threats from the Iran-backed militants in Yemen, who have been routinely targeting commercial ships as well as US and coalition forces in the key waterway with missiles and drones. On board two vessels spearheading the US response to Houthi attacks, the Eisenhower and the US destroyer the USS Gravely in the southern Red Sea, CNN gained unique access and spoke to sailors and pilots who said the Houthi threat remains both unpredictable and unprecedented. The US Navy is working at a frenetic pace, deploying jets and firing missiles at a moment’s notice to try to destroy the Houthis’ weapons and infrastructure. But after dozens of strikes over the last month against Houthi targets both over the Red Sea and inside Yemen, CNN was told that the US military still does not know exactly how much of the Houthis’ capabilities have been destroyed—or how long it will take to deter them for good. “It’s a wicked problem set that we don’t have a lot of great fidelity on,” said Rear Admiral Marc Miguez, the commander of Carrier Strike Group Two, told CNN on Tuesday. Unlike state actors like Iran, Russia and China that the US has prioritized for intelligence collection for years, the US was not paying close attention to the Houthis before they started regularly lobbing missiles into the Red Sea, Miguez said. So the US does not know for sure how much the Houthis have stockpiled, particularly when it comes to what they have buried underground. Learning in real time The Houthis’ attacks, moreover, mark the first time anti-ship ballistic missiles have been used in combat, and the personnel on board the warships are learning in real time how to respond. “This isn’t exactly where we expected to be on this deployment,” said Captain James Huddleston, the deputy commander of Carrier Air Wing 3 who regularly flies missions over the Red Sea and Yemen. “Whenever you are doing something for the first time in a region, that’s not without risk,” Huddleston said. “But we have managed that risk to our strike group and our air crew through the management of combat power.” Dozens of fighter jets take off every day from the Ike carrier to circle the skies over the Red Sea in case they are tasked at a moment’s notice with carrying out a strike against a Houthi target. An F/A-18 with afterburner prepares to launch from the deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea. Scott Pisczek/CNN All of the jets carry air to ground missiles so they can respond immediately to a threat, Miguez said. “Unfortunately, we don’t get a lot of heads up on most of this stuff—especially the ballistic missiles,” he said. The Houthis have also changed their tactics in recent weeks, using drones more regularly to target and attack ships. “They have tried to target coalition forces, US forces, through swarm attacks, using multiple UAVs, using multiple anti-ship ballistic cruise missiles,” said Captain Marvin Scott, the commanding officer of Carrier Air Wing 3. “They are trying everything that they can, but we are prepared for anything they may throw our way.” In many cases the Houthis have been using the Samad-3 drone, Miguez said, which is long-range and carries an explosive payload. The Houthis have also been using Iranian-made drones, according to the Defense Intelligence Agency. “We know for a fact that they are a threat, so we have been taking them down more and more frequently,” he said. CNN previously reported that the US intelligence community has picked up signs that the Iranians are getting nervous about the Houthis’ attacks because of the impact they have had on some of Iran’s only allies, including China and India. Officials believe Iran was at one point using one of its suspected spy ships which has long been parked in the southern Red Sea, the Behshad, to help the Houthis target vessels there. But in a notable shift, Iran moved the ship to the coast of Djibouti earlier this month for the first time in over two years, Miguez said. That has reduced the Houthis’ capability to track ships in the Gulf of Aden, Miguez said. Seconds or minutes to respond Meanwhile, the crew on board the USS Gravely destroyer in the Red Sea are the tip of the spear against inbound Houthi missiles and drones. The sailors often only have seconds to respond to an inbound missile. “We could have seconds, or we could have minutes,” said Navy Lieutenant JG James Rodney, who works in the Gravely’s Combat Information Center. “I wouldn’t say much more than minutes.” The Gravely is equipped with long-range Tomahawk missiles that are capable of reaching targets inside Yemen. But more often, the ship is deploying its anti-air and anti-surface missiles at closer ranges as Houthi missiles and drones close in. Last month, however, a Houthi missile got so close to the Gravely—within one mile of it—that the ship had to use its last line of defense, known as the Phalanx, to take it down. That incident is now being investigated, Miguez said. The Houthis barrages have been so relentless that the Ike carrier and the destroyers deployed nearby have not made a port call in months, which is highly unusual. Sailors said the environment is stressful, but that it has helped to have a mission. “It’s definitely not what we expected, to be out here,” said FC1 Michael Zito, who helps to operate the Gravely’s 54-caliber Mark 45 gun and other weapons systems on board. “We expected to have a more relaxed and chill deployment. But this is what we’ve been training for constantly, day in and day out for years, and we’re ready for whatever else comes through.  We’ll do what needs to be done.” CNN’s Scott Pisczek contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/jim-jordan-biden-ghostwriter-special-counsel-report/index.html,"CNN — House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan sent a letter to President Joe Biden ’s ghostwriter asking for information and an interview after special counsel Robert Hur reported that Biden shared some classified information with him in 2017, according to a letter first obtained by CNN. Jordan asked Mark Zwonitzer to turn over his audio recording of any interviews or conversations with Biden for his memoirs “Promise Me, Dad” and “Promises to Keep,” as well as all documents, communications and contracts related to his ghostwriting work that he shared with the special counsel. Jordan said he wants the materials by February 23. He also requested that Zwonitzer appear for a transcribed interview. “In light of Special Counsel Hur’s investigation and report, the Committee requires materials and information currently in your possession,” Jordan wrote. According to Hur’s report, in 2017 – after leaving the vice president’s office – Biden worked with a ghostwriter for his memoir and told the writer in a recorded conversation that he had “just found all the classified stuff downstairs,” which investigators believed referred to the home he was renting in Virginia. Investigators believed the evidence suggested Biden was referring to classified documents about the Afghanistan troop surge in 2009 – which FBI agents later found in his garage in Delaware. Hur’s report said the “best case for charges” would rely on Biden possessing classified documents in 2017, since it was after he had left the vice presidency and before he became president in 2021. But, Hur ultimately did not present any charges. In a news conference following the release of the report, the president said of the allegations of sharing classified information with his ghostwriter, “I did not share classified information, I did not share it.” The report said, “several defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.” “For example, Mr. Biden could have found the classified Afghanistan documents at his Virginia home in 2017 and then forgotten about them soon after. This could convince some reasonable jurors that he did not retain them willfully,” the report said. The report also said that the fact that Biden never talked about the documents again in the “dozens of hours” of recorded conversations with his ghostwriter, paired with how the documents were found in Biden’s garage – in a damaged box surrounded by “household detritus” – could suggest Biden had forgotten about them. “In addition, Mr. Biden’s memory was significantly limited, both during his recorded interviews with the ghostwriter in 2017, and in his interview with our office in 2023,” the report said. “And his cooperation with our investigation, including by reporting to the government that the Afghanistan documents were in his Delaware garage, will likely convince some jurors that he made an innocent mistake, rather than acting willfully – that is, with intent to break the law – as the statute requires.” Hur also said Biden’s conversations with his ghostwriter “from 2017 are often painfully slow, with Mr. Biden struggling to remember events and straining at times to read and relay his own notebook entries.” Prosecutors ultimately did not charge Zwonitzer with obstruction of justice after learning the ghostwriter deleted audio recordings he had that were of “significant evidentiary value.” The FBI was able to mostly recover the deleted files after Zwonitzer turned over his computer and external hard drive, according to the report.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/tiktok-biden-campaign/index.html,"CNN — The Biden campaign’s venture onto TikTok has been met with mixed reviews, as some supporters praise the attempt to explore new ways to reach young adults while others insist the account needs to engage on a more substantive level to appear authentic. The account, created Sunday, has released a dozen posts, a mix of cable news clips bashing former President Donald Trump , jokes about President Joe Biden ’s age, a Super Bowl video featuring the Dark Brandon meme and a clip of campaign staffers defending him against special counsel Robert Hur’s comments on his mental acuity. Supporters of the president’s reelection efforts say the new account is a step in the right direction and offers an outlet to better tout what his administration has accomplished for young people, such as a TikTok featuring a former school principal whose student loans were forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But critics, and some allies, warn that there is a fine line between genuinely engaging with voters and being performative. “If he is just getting on the platform to share memes, I think he’s going to find tons of pushback and comment sections that are full of people calling him out,” Dakota Hall, executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action, told CNN. A new source for news For the Biden campaign, joining the social media site presents the possibility for modest rewards but also high risks. Digital strategists see TikTok as a critical tool for Democratic candidates to reach young voters, a bloc that has soured on Biden amidst rising inflation, concerns about his age and his administration’s response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “I think they had to launch one,” said Cate Domino, a senior vice president for digital at Precision Strategies, a Democratic consulting firm. “At this point, TikTok use has grown extremely rapidly, even in the past four years, and to not have a place to contribute to the narrative there would be malpractice.” Biden won 60% of 18- to 29-year-old voters and 52% of 30- to 44-year-olds in 2020, according to CNN exit poll data. But recent polling has shown his grasp on that bloc slipping . A CNN/SSRS poll released February 1 found Biden winning 49% of 18- to 34-year-olds, compared to 46% who backed Trump. While only a third of Americans have ever used TikTok, 62% of 18- to 29-year-olds have, according to a survey by Pew Research released last month. Last November, Pew found that 32% of 18- to 29-year-olds regularly get their news from the app. “The campaign is now on TikTok because frankly that’s where people are,” Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster said in a statement to CNN. “Having a presence on TikTok gives us the chance to maximize the reach of the president’s vision.” Campaigns have, for the most part, avoided the platform. Republicans have supported banning the app, which is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company, over national security and spying concerns. Biden signed legislation banning the use of TikTok on government devices in 2022. Those concerns have kept the White House off the app and may have delayed the Biden campaign’s decision to join. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the ban remains in effect. The campaign has said they are taking “advanced safety precautions” around the app. Despite security concerns, some politicians have found success on the app. Democratic Rep. Jeff Jackson of North Carolina has amassed 2.5 million followers with his straight-to-camera videos explaining the goings on of Congress. Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, has more than 240,000 followers on his account, which was launched during his 2022 run against Republican Mehmet Oz. The account used memes to bash Oz and paint him as a financially out of touch carpetbagger. “It’s not a copy and paste formula,” said Annie Wu Henry, a digital communications strategist who ran Fetterman’s account. “It shouldn’t look the same, because you shouldn’t be telling one person to do something that doesn’t feel right or make sense for them.” Unlike the Fetterman and Jackson accounts, the Biden campaign’s account – Biden-Harris HQ – is not solely focused on the president, who has appeared in less than half of the videos so far. One two-minute TikTok posted Tuesday features communications director Michael Tyler and deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty defending Biden and blasting press coverage of the Hur report on the president’s handling of classified papers. The report did not recommend charges against Biden but said the president presented as a “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” and struggled to recall key details, including the year his son Beau died. The president and his allies have pushed back against what they said were false characterization of Biden’s memory. “There’s one line in the document that matters: the first one,” Tyler says in the video. “Joe Biden was completely cleared of wrongdoing, and with your help we’ll beat Donald Trump, the lazy media narrative and the MAGA Republicans they’re enabling in November.” Coming off phony Some groups supporting the president’s reelection efforts say Biden joining the social media platform is a step in the right direction that could help him better tout what his administration has done for young people. “It’s a meaningful signal that the Biden campaign acknowledges the power that young voters will have in November and prioritizes engagement with us,” said Jack Lobel, the national press secretary for Voters of Tomorrow. He added: “Young people have been left out of the political process for decades. So we need to take every route possible to bring them into the process.” Young voters have expressed their frustrations over Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict and his refusal to support a permanent ceasefire. And as Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail, protests have continued to follow them at appearances across the country – and, now, into the comments section. Ariana Afshar, a 27-year-old California-based content creator with more than 200,000 followers on TikTok, said the campaign’s TikTok doesn’t change the fact that he has refused to support a ceasefire in Gaza. She doesn’t plan on voting for the president. “This technique would’ve been successful, in my opinion, if he actually listened to young voters,” said. “But he doesn’t, so it’s coming off a bit phony.” Hours after Biden released his first video on the social media platform, where he weighed in on the Super Bowl and who he’ll support in the upcoming election, Israel carried out military airstrikes in Gaza as part of a hostage rescue mission, killing more than 100 people in Rafah. Claire Simon, the communications coordinator for Gen-Z for Change, a national youth-led organization that was once known as TikTok for Biden, pointed to the comments as evidence that some saw the strategy as “incredibly tone-deaf.” She pointed to the dozens of comments on the campaign’s first TikTok asking about Rafah. “It’s really a substance-over-style issue he’s having,” she said. “A lot of young people are pretty unhappy with Biden … a TikTok account isn’t really going to fix that issue for him.” Facing critics TikTok’s comment section can be a source for engagement but also a breeding ground for trolls. To date, the Biden campaign’s videos have received comments praising the president, praising Trump, questioning Biden’s mental fitness and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The campaign can ignore the spam, but needs to engage with the good faith criticisms, digital strategists say. “Once you’re on TikTok, you’re in a more one-to-one relationship with supporters,” said Kasey O’Brien, the director of social & texting at Middle Seat, a progressive strategy and consultant firm. “There will be more opportunities for him to expand on and explain his policy positions.” Creating space for negative feedback could also help the campaign show that it’s listening and taking young voters seriously, Henry said. “One thing that … young people don’t like is pandering,” she said. “An 18-year-old’s vote is worth the exact same as a 60 year old’s vote.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/biden-palestinians-temporary-protection-deportation/index.html,"CNN — President Joe Biden granted Palestinians in the United States temporary protection from deportation amid the ongoing conflict overseas, according to a new memo Wednesday. The move comes as the White House faces immense pressure from the Arab-American community over the situation in Gaza. Late last year, Democrats urged Biden to extend temporary protections to Palestinians in the US, arguing that those already in the country “should not be forced to return to the Palestinian territories, consistent with President Biden’s stated commitment to protecting Palestinian civilians.” The president has discretion to authorize what’s known as deferred enforced departure, which protects those covered from removal from the US for a period of time. Those who qualify are also eligible for work permits. “In light of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian needs on the ground, President Biden signed a memorandum directing the deferral of removal of certain Palestinians who are present in the United States, giving them a temporary safe haven,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement Wednesday. “Specifically, President Biden is granting deferred enforced departure for 18 months to Palestinians that are currently in the United States,” the statement continued. Those convicted of felonies or who pose a public safety threat are not eligible for deferred enforced departure."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — The immigration and border crisis is quickly morphing into the dominant issue of American politics – and Democrats are pivoting faster than Republicans at the moment. GOP lawmakers have long claimed immigration as their top issue, raising the alarm about the drastic rise of migrants and asylum-seekers at the southern border. Blaming President Joe Biden for the border crisis is the backbone of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. But after a defeat in a special election to fill a New York House seat, Republicans might be wondering if they are being outmaneuvered by Democrats who are adjusting to acknowledge the crisis and suddenly preaching bipartisanship. A drastic, new migrant policy under consideration by the Biden administration will only heap pressure on Republicans to relent and seek middle ground with the White House even as they complain about Biden’s current policy. Here’s what’s happened with immigration so far this week: Republicans, committed to casting blame, impeach Mayorkas. It took two tries, but House Republicans made their point and voted by the narrowest possible margin to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , the first impeachment of a Cabinet secretary since the 1870s. The Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, will surely acquit Mayorkas or figure out a way to dismiss the charges, but not without an unwanted spectacle. There are consequences for failing to legislate. After the failure of a bipartisan Senate compromise to revamp border policy and add funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Biden administration has drawn up a draft contingency plan to address a massive budget shortfall by cutting detention capacity and releasing thousands of immigrants. The House GOP majority shrank. It’s a good thing for the Republicans who supported the impeachment that they got it done Tuesday night, since Democrats picked up a seat in the special election to replace disgraced former Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from the House in December. Democrats are triangulating. How did the winner in New York, former Rep. Tom Suozzi , win back his old seat? He tacked to the middle specifically on the issue of immigration, hammering Republicans for refusing to work with Democrats on an immigration compromise. “Let’s send a message to our friends running the Congress these days: Stop running around for Trump, and start running the country,” Suozzi told supporters after claiming victory Tuesday night. A migrant family leaves the Row Hotel in midtown Manhattan January 10, 2024. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Immigration is a major issue in New York City. Immigration might have been the issue on which Republicans could have kept the seat despite the bad taste Santos may have left in voters’ mouths. A serial fabulist who misrepresented just about everything in his background, Santos is set to be prosecuted for, among other things, defrauding donors to his 2022 campaign. But New York is feeling the pinch of the immigration crisis. Mayor Eric Adams has complained the city can no longer cope with the thousands of migrants being shipped to the city by, among others, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Republicans say NBD. Even though Suozzi’s win shrinks the narrow House Republican majority even further and makes it more difficult for Speaker Mike Johnson to pass any legislation, Johnson told fellow GOP lawmakers not to panic during a closed-door meeting Wednesday, according to CNN’s Capitol Hill team. Later, he noted that Democrats spent more money on the race than Republicans and told reporters that Suozzi won because he “ran like a Republican.” “He sounded like a Republican, talking about the border and immigration, because everybody knows that’s the top issue,” Johnson said. Except voters concerned about immigration told CNN reporters that it was also dysfunction on Capitol Hill – Republicans rejected even the idea of a bipartisan immigration deal last week – that drove their votes. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate joined together to pass a foreign aid package this week after it was decoupled from the border compromise. But Johnson opposes allowing votes on that bill too. This is the definition of a catch-22. Without any irony after helping kill the border compromise, Johnson said he could not accept any aid for Ukraine and Israel until there is action on the border. “House Republicans were crystal clear from the very beginning of discussions that any so-called national security supplemental legislation must recognize that national security begins at our own border,” Johnson said in a statement, days after helping kill legislation to address the situation at the border. Democrats are embracing the rhetoric of bipartisanship – for now. Reacting to Suozzi’s victory, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that voters respond to people who want to solve problems. “Tom Suozzi talked about common-sense solutions. And finding bipartisan common ground. Tom Suozzi won,” Jeffries said. Fight or flight? It’s perfectly reasonable to wonder why anyone would want to work on Capitol Hill. Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin , one of three Republicans to vote against impeaching Mayorkas, was surrounded and pressured by colleagues on the House floor last week during the first impeachment effort. Days later, he announced he would not run for reelection. “Electoral politics was never supposed to be a career and, trust me, Congress is no place to grow old,” Gallagher, who had been viewed as a rising star in the party, said in a statement. Compare that with former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan , an anti-Trump Republican who recently announced he would run for a seat in the US Senate after previously saying he had no interest in working on Capitol Hill. He still isn’t exactly excited about it, Hogan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “Inside Politics” on Wednesday. “Who in their right mind would want to go in and be a part of that divisiveness and dysfunction?” Hogan asked. But he made the decision a week ago, he said, after the “debacle that took place on the Senate floor” when the bipartisan immigration deal was abandoned. Biden, he argued, has failed to secure the border. But Republicans, given the opportunity to work toward a solution, backed off. “I thought it was typical dysfunction,” he later added. “I’m frustrated with both parties down there, and that’s a perfect example – it’s an important thing that most people in America want us to solve, and it’s not getting solved because it’s just typical Washington politics.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/congress-trump-nato-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — Lawmakers from both parties last December may have been anticipating former President Donald Trump’s current NATO trash talk when they quietly slipped language limiting a president’s power to pull the US out the alliance into the annual defense policy bill , which passed with bipartisan support. Trump boasted at a weekend campaign rally that as president he told an unidentified NATO leader that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” with member countries who are in arrears on defense spending. The whole point of NATO is supposed to be that members act to defend each other if attacked. President Joe Biden seized on Trump’s recent NATO bashing, suggesting in Tuesday remarks from the White House that Trump was the first president who “bowed down” to a Russian dictator, which Biden said was “dumb,” “shameful,” “dangerous” and “un-American.” Add that criticism to a chorus of alarm from NATO and European officials after Trump’s comments and in the midst of House Republicans’ blockage of additional aid for Ukraine. Trump’s desire to pull out of NATO The post-World War II alliance of Western democracies was built around NATO, but Trump has long complained that the US is getting a raw deal with the organization, paying too much and getting too little. Trump’s ultimate goal, writes CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen , has long been to pull the US out of NATO, which was formed in 1949 to contain the threat of the Soviet Union and the spread of communism and is now organized around deterring Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN’s Jim Sciutto, in a forthcoming book , quotes a former official in both the Trump and Biden administrations who predicts a Trump election win in November would mean “the US will be out of NATO.” Sciutto also writes about how Trump nearly pulled the US from the alliance during a 2018 NATO meeting. At the same time, Trump tried to claim credit, arguing it is his tough talk and not the threat of Russian invasion that has caused NATO member countries to increase their defense budgets in recent years. What’s to stop him? If Trump wins the 2024 election and does turn on NATO, he would run into that new language from Congress, which says the president “shall not suspend, terminate, denounce, or withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty” without either a supermajority vote in the Senate or an act passed by the full Congress. When I asked the former US Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker about what Trump could do to undermine NATO as president, he first pointed out that Trump was boasting about his interaction with an unnamed world leader rather than promising future action. Kurt Volker testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on November 19, 2019, in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The Constitution, Volker noted, says the Senate must be involved with ratifying treaties but it is silent on the subject of withdrawing from a treaty. Any court battle could take years. Alternatives to withdrawal Rather than attempting to withdraw from NATO, a second Trump presidency could allow his allies to pursue a policy of making NATO “ dormant ,” an idea pushed by at least one Trump-allied think tank. Nobody knows exactly what that would look like, Volker said, but the president has immense power over how the US interacts with its allies. “There’s lots of things that you can do administratively as the commander in chief that would still be very disruptive for NATO,” Volker said. A president could reduce the number of exercises Americans take part in with NATO allies, further reduce troop presence in Europe, withhold payments to the NATO infrastructure or cut down on the US military budget. The US would still be bound, under this type of scenario, by the pledge to defend other NATO nations, but it would not be prepared. “It’s not just enough to say, yes, we will fight together,” said Volker. “You actually have to have the capabilities.” Americans lead NATO by design If Trump wins the election this year and then seeks as president to reduce American military participation, he could, in theory, recall the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower first held the job after NATO’s founding, and ever since, the top NATO commander has always been an American admiral or general. NATO’s power to deter attacks on other countries rests in large part on American nuclear weapons, and so it is appropriate that an American service member sits atop the NATO structure, according to Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. This December 1957 photo shows heads of government, including US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, attending the annual ""family portrait"" during NATO top-level meetings at the Palais de Chaillot. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Pulling American generals out of NATO might force other NATO countries to seek their own nuclear deterrents. Part of the reason Europeans have not pursued a collective European military is by American design and a result of security provided by NATO, Bergmann said. Countries are eager to be protected by Article 5 of NATO’s charter, which is the principle that an attack on one member is an attack on all of the members. Sweden and Finland have both worked hard to join after Russia invaded non-member Ukraine. Finland joined in 2023, and Sweden is inching closer to accession . That provision that Trump dislikes has only been invoked one time, after 9/11, when the US and NATO allies invaded Afghanistan after terror attacks brought down the World Trade Center and struck the Pentagon. More members hit 2% benchmark Trump frequently complains that NATO members other than the US don’t pay dues, which is a misstatement of facts . Members are supposed to spend a minimum of 2% of their GDP on defense, but it is just a guideline that doesn’t require payments to NATO or the US. Multiple NATO countries do not hit that benchmark, although spending has risen since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “That argument is weaker and weaker, because allies are indeed spending more and doing more,” Volker said. NATO’s charter is a relatively short and simple document. Its section on how a country withdraws from the alliance is further evidence of how central the US is to the organization: A country wishing to withdraw must notify the US a year before it plans to withdraw. No country, by the way, has ever withdrawn from NATO, although France did not take part in NATO’s military operations from the mid-1960s until 2009. A difficult relationship to unbreak If Trump is reelected and chooses to hollow out NATO or make US participation dormant, it would sever ties that future presidents might have trouble repairing. “It’s just like any relationship,” said Bergmann of the likelihood of permanent damage if Trump were to materially alter the NATO alliance. “This would be seen as the US basically having a massive affair and like cheating on Europe. Could the marriage be restored? Well, potentially. But it would require, I think, a lot of effort on the part of future administrations.” Marco Rubio is not worried Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was a sponsor of the new law meant to prohibit a president from leaving NATO. Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, he dismissed the threat posed by Trump. “He’s telling a story,” Rubio said, adding, “He doesn’t talk like a traditional politician, and we’ve already been through this. You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.” “I have zero concern, because he’s been president before. I know exactly what he has done and will do with the NATO alliance,” Rubio said, although he added, “But there has to be an alliance.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/new-york-special-election-biden-trump/index.html,"CNN — Democrats, when confronted with President Joe Biden ’s poor polling numbers, often counter with some form of the following: “Polls are polls, but when people vote, Democrats are doing well.” The idea being that Democrats have done well in major special and off-year elections since the 2022 midterms. The special election in New York’s 3rd Congressional District to succeed the infamous George Santos offers perhaps the best chance to test Democrats’ theory ahead of the presidential election. Does former Rep. Tom Suozzi win in yet another example of Democrats defying national polling trends? Or does Nassau County Legislator Mazi Pilip secure victory, showing how Republicans are winning pivotal races in places Biden comfortably won in 2020? Yes, we’re looking at just one election on Long Island, but it’s a fascinating one. As we enter Election Day, the race seems far too close to call. A Newsday/Siena College poll released last week put Suozzi at 48% and Pilip at 44%, a result well within the margin of error. Throw in forecasted bad weather in this Nassau County and eastern Queens district, and we really can’t be certain who will emerge victorious. The fact that the race is tight makes sense if you look at the district’s recent voting record . I mentioned that Biden carried the seat in 2020 (by 8 points), but local Republicans have been dominating since. They did well in 2023’s local races . GOP candidates for governor and US Senate won the district by margins between 4 and 12 points in 2022, as did Santos. This means that even a narrow Suozzi victory would be impressive for Democrats given how well Republicans have done in other elections in the area. Indeed, outside of Long Island, Democrats did well in last year’s big elections. They won the Kentucky gubernatorial election , maintained their majority in the Virginia Senate and flipped the Virginia House . The candidate favored by Democrats won a Wisconsin Supreme Court race , which gave the more liberal justices a majority on that court. A lot of analysts (myself included) have been skeptical about making too much of these results. Turnout in off-year elections is often low. Voters who have been showing up for these off-year races have been more Democratic-leaning than their share of all registered voters in the same states and districts     . Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at the Hyatt Hotel in Coralville, Iowa, on December 13. Scott Olson/Getty Images Related article Why Donald Trump should be hoping for high voter turnout Of course, we’re now in a presidential election year, and there are also signs that these off-year results may have been pointing at something important. Yes, the turnout may have been more Democratic than among all registered voters. But the turnout in the presidential election may be as well. Most national pollsters are gauging responses from registered voters. Not all registered voters will cast a ballot in the presidential election. When pollsters such as Ipsos and The New York Times have honed on either those certain to vote or those likely to vote this year, Biden has done significantly better against his likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump . Ipsos, for example, recently showed a 5-point lead for the former president among registered voters becoming a tie among those certain to vote. A Suozzi win would further prove the point that Democrats do well when voters are treated to an actual campaign. On the other hand, a win by Pilip would give us a different narrative. This is the only federal election since the midterms that has been remotely competitive. All the other competitive races were state elections, and voting patterns between US House and presidential elections are far more correlated than they are for state offices and presidential elections. While it would be easy to dismiss a Pilip win by saying that Long Island has swung to the right since 2020, the rest of the country may have as well. Remember that in the last high-turnout election (the 2022 midterms), Republicans won control of the US House . They did so while winning the House popular vote by 3 points. That Republican victory represented a 6-point swing from the 2020 House elections . Moreover, that 3-point Republican edge in 2022 looks a lot like Trump’s current advantage over Biden among registered voters nationally. In other words, it’s possible that the national environment hasn’t moved all that much from the last time Republicans secured an important win. So a victory by Pilip would suggest that perhaps things aren’t all that different from where we were in 2022. This would mean that we have a closely divided electorate, but one with which Republicans are favored. Either way, you can bet your last dollar that both sides will try to spin the New York special election result. What else would you expect when there’s been more than $10 million spent on ads , which I can report have been playing nonstop on local television."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/trump-appeal-scotus-delay-tactic-analysis/index.html,"Donald Trump’s filing to the Supreme Court over his claim for sweeping presidential immunity begins with a quote from Yogi Berra. “This application is déjà vu all over again,” the former president’s lawyers write, noting that special counsel Jack Smith had tried and failed to get the nine justices to decide the question on a fast-track basis in December. But another of the late and revered New York Yankees catcher’s phrases offers a better summation of Trump’s interminable delay-at-all-costs legal strategy designed to defer a reckoning until after November’s election — “It ain’t over till it’s over.” The ex-president asked the Supreme Court on Monday to step in to temporarily block a US Court of Appeals decision that last week eviscerated his claims that a president is effectively above the law while in office and shielded from prosecution afterwards. The filing is Trumpian in its audacity. In essence, it argues that it would be unfair to millions of voters if the ex-President cannot get his message out in the 2024 election because he is on trial over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The former president was less concerned about the rights of voters when he sought to thwart their choice to eject him from office in 2020. After an unprecedented effort by Trump to interrupt the cherished tradition of peaceful transfers of power three years ago, Trump’s attorneys nevertheless insist the real “stunning breach of precedent and historical norms” is that the lower court ruled that presidential immunity for official acts does not exist at all. While Trump argues he was using presidential power in a legitimate effort to bring to light electoral fraud, there is nothing in the Constitution that gives the president the right or duty to officially administer elections, count votes or contact local election officials as the ex-president is alleged to have done. The coming days could decide when the first Trump trial takes place The text of Trump’s filing to the court at times feels somewhat frivolous. In tone and depth, it contrasts to the tightly argued repudiation of his claims for immunity last week by three appeals court judges that was widely praised by legal scholars. And it reflected the extraordinarily broad and improbable vision of almost unconstrained presidential power to which Trump warmed in office and that he appears to relish regaining if he wins November’s election ahead of a term he has vowed would be devoted to retribution against his enemies. “This brief, this petition for a stay, is pretty weak,” Ty Cobb, a former counsel in Trump’s White House, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “I don’t think the Supreme Court is going to find these arguments compelling in any way.” Trump’s latest request comes at a critical moment because the steps that the Supreme Court takes in coming days will likely decide whether this case — one of the most potentially damaging of the four criminal trials that await Trump — will go to a jury before the election. This is not just a matter of seeking accountability for the ex-president’s bid to stay in power despite losing the last election to President Joe Biden. It could also sway the destiny of the White House since some polls, including a national NBC News survey this month , suggest that some Trump voters may not support him if he’s a convicted felon when they go to vote. In what is expected to be a close election, even small-scale defections from Biden could weigh on the result. Trump’s legal team has a good reason to try to run out the clock. Therefore its moves should be assessed as much for their political impact as for the quality of litigation in an election season that has merged Trump’s legal and campaign strategies. Trump asked the Supreme Court to put the entire case on hold to allow him to pursue the full extent of his rights as an appellant, potentially to include a so-called en banc appeal to a full bench of appeals court judges and then ultimately to the high court, a process that could take many weeks or months. But it is not certain that the Supreme Court, which last week heard oral arguments on another Trump case — over his expulsion from Colorado’s ballot — will even agree to take his latest request. The special counsel has until February 20 to respond to Trump’s petition, though Smith is likely to file much earlier. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the real world impact of the new petition was that it would “almost certainly dictate whether or not Donald Trump goes on trial on Jack Smith’s election case before or after the 2024 election.” First, the Supreme Court must decide whether to grant a stay, but Honig said, “The bigger question is: Will the Supreme Court ultimately take this case? If they do not take the case it’s going to go back down to the district court, and I think we are very likely looking at a trial this summer. If they do take the case and set it on something close to a normal schedule, I think in all likelihood that would push the timeline here out until after the 2024 election — that’s how big the stakes are.” Norm Eisen, another CNN legal analyst, said that the court would likely grant some kind of stay, but that even if it did decide to take the case, the court could put it on an expedited schedule. “The long-term odds for success are poor. But it’s a delay game at this point,” Eisen said. But Trump and Smith both know time is short with a trial threatening to coincide with the heat of the presidential election. “The really precarious situation that Jack Smith finds themselves in and the Justice Department find themselves in is that every day matters at this point, given the calendar and the political calendar,” Ankush Khardori, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I don’t expect them to countenance the whole delaying tactic, at least I hope that they will not, but we are now starting to cut it pretty close here.” Trump’s extraordinary collision of legal peril As is often the case, Trump had a crowded legal docket on Monday. The historic spectacle of a former president making an unprecedented request for blanket immunity — that appears to fly in the face of founding US principles of constraining unaccountable executive power — only emerged after an earlier court appearance. The former president took part in a closed hearing in Florida as his lawyers haggled with Smith’s team for access to classified material pertinent to the case over his hoarding of secret government documents at his resort home. As with Smith’s Washington case, Trump’s team is seeking to delay the trial currently scheduled for May. The former president is also expected in court on Thursday in Manhattan, in a hearing related to a hush money payment sent to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. That case is now expected to be the first of Trump’s four criminal trials to go ahead at the end of March — after the judge in the federal elections case postponed the start of her proceeding pending the ex-president’s appeals. Trump is hoping meanwhile that Fani Willis, the district attorney leading his Georgia election subversion case, could be dismissed following the disclosure of a personal relationship with a lead prosecutor. A hearing is set for Thursday after a judge presiding over the case said Willis could be disqualified if she financially benefited from the relationship. And in yet another fateful development in court his week for Trump, a New York judge is expected to issue his ruling on Friday over how much Trump will have to pay over ill-gotten gains related to a civil fraud trial targeting the former President, the Trump Organization and his adult sons. A large chunk of Trump’s fortune is at risk in the case as well as his capacity to do business in New York state. This stunning roster of cases is an oppressive load for any defendant — let alone one running for president – but it does not even complete the full extent of his legal liabilities. However, it raises the prospect of a dark period ahead for Trump if he doesn’t win the 2024 election and is not able to use presidential power to halt trials or reverse convictions in any of the federal proceedings against him. This story has been updated with additional developments."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — While the 2024 presidential race seems set in stone as a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, it’s also true that things happen. Back in November 1872, for instance, the newspaper publisher and Democratic presidential candidate Horace Greeley died after Election Day but before the casting of Electoral College votes. While it did not affect the outcome – President Ulysses S. Grant easily won reelection – Greeley’s death created the difficult question of what to do with the 66 Electoral College votes he had won. Most electors, meeting in state capitols, did not cast votes for the deceased Greeley, but rather split them among four other candidates . Congress did not count the three votes that were cast for a dead man. Pictured is American abolitionist, journalist and politician Horace Greeley, who edited the New York Tribune. MPI/Getty Images In the more than 150 years since Greeley’s death, there have been two constitutional amendments related to presidential succession, but there is still some gray area when it comes to an unforeseen event that strikes a presidential nominee or candidate. Today, polling suggests voters are worried that both Trump and Biden are too old for the job. Trump will be 78 on Election Day in November, and Biden will turn 82 later that month. Without being macabre, it’s worth knowing what would happen if, for whatever reason, either man was unable to continue with the race. Replacing either man on the ballot – not that anyone is seriously talking about it – would be a messy and chaotic process that would uncover divisions and disagreements within the political parties. No one knows for sure what would happen if a candidate died or for some reason needed to withdraw from the race. Here’s a look at the rules for Republicans and Democrats as they currently stand. What happens if a candidate cannot continue his or her campaign? The process of replacing a presidential candidate very much depends on when the vacancy occurs – during the primary process and before the party convention; during the convention or after the convention; or before or after people vote in November. What happens if a vacancy occurs during the primary process? While Trump and Biden are in total command of the respective races to be the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, that process will play out between now and June as states conduct primaries and caucuses and assign delegates based on the results. If a vacancy on either side happens before most of those primaries were to occur, it’s possible that another candidate could emerge and rack up some delegates. But since filing deadlines have already passed for many primaries, it’s unlikely any single candidate, other than Trump or Biden, could rack up enough delegates to win the nomination before party conventions this summer. It is, however, possible that states could decide to delay their primaries, according to Elaine Kamarck , a member of the Democratic National Committee rules committee and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied the issue. Republicans will hold their convention in Milwaukee in July, and Democrats will hold theirs just to the south in Chicago in August. Most delegates will have been awarded by the end of March. Biden has not faced serious opposition in the Democratic primary, has won every delegate at stake so far and needs to win at least 1,968 of 3,934 to secure the nomination on the first ballot of voting. On the Republican side, Trump has won every contest so far and ultimately needs 1,215 of 2,429 delegates. His top rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, is far behind Trump in the delegate race. What if a vacancy occurs after the primaries and before or during the convention? If the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would likely decide the party’s nominee on the convention floor. That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. There would be a messy political battle in every state over who would get to be a delegate (if the vacancy happened before many of those people were chosen) and then who they would ultimately support. Even people who did not run primary campaigns could ultimately be considered. You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to be on the ballot if, for some reason, Biden left the race. At the same time, given Haley’s weakness in primaries, it seems unlikely that Republicans would coalesce around her if Trump was unable to run. On the Democratic side, there would also be another group to consider: the “superdelegates,” a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can’t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they’re free to vote on subsequent ballots. Has anything like this ever happened before? The modern primary and caucus system evolved only in recent generations as voters demanded more involvement in the nominating process. The election that sparked change was in 1968, when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run after an embarrassing finish in New Hampshire’s primary. Johnson won, but just barely. When he dropped out of the presidential race, it set off a chaotic dash to replace him. One candidate who jumped in the race, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Los Angeles just after winning the California primary, creating the difficult question of who his delegates should support. The ultimate Democratic winner that year, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, amassed his delegates in states that did not conduct primaries, securing enough support to win the nomination. Violence on the streets of Chicago around the convention marred the event and helped inspire the system of primaries and caucuses we have today where voters pick presidential candidates through delegates bound to support a specific candidate. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party’s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrats – The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership. Republicans – If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth Congressional Research Service memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party’s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party’s nominee. Neither party, according to CRS, requires that the presidential candidate’s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, but that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health). The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern’s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/trump-biden-election-2024/index.html,"CNN — President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are each offering a stark glimpse at the political liabilities that have many Americans wishing they had other options in 2024. Biden, 81, is angrily refuting questions about his age and memory, struggling to lay to rest anxiety among voters that he wouldn’t be capable of serving a full second term. But far from exploiting the president’s rough patch, Trump offered a stunning display of extremism at the weekend, raising fresh questions over his fitness for the Oval Office. The comparison between the likely general election opponents helps explain why polls show limited enthusiasm for both men, each of whom is unpopular outside their core constituencies. Biden would be the more conventional choice because Trump is promising one of the most tumultuous second terms in US history. But as the president’s campaign gathers pace, his troubles are complicating his effort to convince Americans that Trump would destroy American democracy and would shatter the country’s reputation abroad. Trump is giving every impression that his second term would be even more aberrant than his first, as he vows to use presidential power to exact retribution against his enemies. But he’s nevertheless closely matched with Biden in polling and has a real chance to win. While a Biden vs. Trump race would be a rematch of 2020, it would not necessarily be the same. The sitting president is four years older, and age questions are even more acute. And Trump is even more radical and unchained than when he left office. How Biden and Trump are putting their political weaknesses on display The different liabilities both would bring to the race were on display during the frantic last few days. In Trump, voters can pick an ex-president facing 91 criminal charges who has been found liable for fraud, sexual battery and defamation in court. Trump, 77, tried to stay in power after losing reelection in 2020. This weekend, Trump sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over NATO allies and mocked the military service of GOP rival Nikki Haley’s husband. This week, the ex-president faces a set of court deadlines and hearings that will renew the focus on his seemingly endless threats to the rule of law. In Biden, voters must decide whether to reelect the oldest president ever, at 81, who is angrily refuting claims of a declining memory following a damning assessment of his faculties by a special counsel. The president, who warns Trump is a danger to democracy , is visibly aging while mixing up the names of foreign leaders , and polls show overwhelming skepticism among the public about his reelection plans. The key question voters will face is not whether Biden is fit to serve as commander in chief now, but rather: Will he still be by the end of a second term, when he would be 86? Multiple polls have shown how little voters like the alternatives they will almost certainly get in the 2024 election. And while partisans may already be locked in, the comparison between the sitting president and the former one, both of whom crave a second term, will be critical in the handful of swing states where a relatively small number of voters will be decisive. The debate over Biden’s age and Trump’s fitness for office help explain why there’s a possibility that several third-party or independent candidates — for instance, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — could have an outsize impact on the destiny of the White House. But while speculation will mount about how either party might thwart a 2020 election replay, practical impediments make the idea of dumping a potential nominee an almost unthinkable scenario. Trump’s wild weekend tear Over the weekend, Trump showed how his uncontrolled stream of rhetoric and insults can often be politically counterproductive and play into the core narratives of Biden’s campaign. In a shocking remark at a rally in South Carolina on Saturday, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that didn’t meet the alliance’s guidelines for defense spending. Trump’s comments reveal his view of NATO not as the main driver of peace in Europe for half a century but as a protection racket. His comments are also dangerous, since the alliance’s credibility relies on Russia believing that members would defend an ally that was attacked, in line with Article 5 commitments. Any sense this is false could lead to miscalculations in Moscow. And this is just the latest in a long list of occasions in which the ex-president has appeared to indulge Putin’s goals instead of traditional US national interests. Biden warned in a statement that his likely opponent was unsuitable to be commander in chief. “Donald Trump’s admission that he intends to give Putin a greenlight for more war and violence, to continue his brutal assault against a free Ukraine, and to expand his aggression to the people of Poland and the Baltic States are appalling and dangerous,” Biden said. Trump’s defenders insist his comments are merely a ruse to get NATO members — some of whom are still short of their targets — to spend more on defense. Defense spending rose in some cases following Trump’s pressure in his first term — although his ranting about NATO members not paying their “bills” was not the only factor. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who was a conventional hawkish conservative when he ran against Trump in 2016, defended the ex-president Sunday. “Donald Trump is not a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,” Rubio said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “He doesn’t talk like a traditional politician, and we’ve already been through this. You would think people would’ve figured it out by now.” Still, Trump caused alarm in Europe. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, called his remarks “reckless.” And Trump’s statement will refuel speculation about the odd nature of his relationship with Putin, who is accused of war crimes and has directly targeted civilians in Ukraine. It will also renew fears that Trump would try to pull the US out of NATO if he’s reelected, which would delight Russia. Trump’s comments also come as his GOP allies, especially in the House, are trying to thwart Biden’s new aid package for Ukraine, a sovereign democracy invaded by the Russian autocrat in the widest European land war since World War II. And the sympathetic interview of Putin last week by Tucker Carlson, the far-right populist broadcaster, only underscores the Trump GOP’s embrace of Putinism. Former President Donald Trump speaks in Conway, South Carolina, on February 10, 2024. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Trump’s contempt for those who serve in the military — was also highlighted in his South Carolina speech. He asked of Haley’s husband, Michael: “Where is he? He’s gone,” apparently arguing that his rival’s spouse knew her campaign would not do well. Michael Haley is on a yearlong deployment in Africa. Nikki Haley targeted Trump on X, saying: “Michael is deployed serving our country, something you know nothing about. Someone who continually disrespects the sacrifices of military families has no business being commander in chief.” This is far from the first time that Trump has disparaged the military service of political opponents. He’s still attacking the late Arizona Sen. John McCain after mocking his incarceration and the injuries he sustained when his plane went down and he was tortured during the Vietnam War. Trump’s conduct was not just typical of the way he has crushed every tradition of presidential decorum. It also offered a potential roadmap to the substance and character of his possible second term. At the same time, Trump’s weekend eruptions also show why he may be a compromised general-election candidate. They played directly into Biden’s claims that he’s too extreme and too morally challenged to be president again. And Trump’s latest outbursts are politically self-defeating: They took attention away from Biden’s frantic attempts at damage control following special counsel Robert Hur’s devastating assessment of Biden as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Much has been written about the new, disciplined Trump campaign. But the ex-president is reminding voters of his volatile first term, which included two impeachments. Biden struggles to parry increasing worries about his age The White House and Biden’s allies spent the weekend fighting back following a late Thursday news conference at which the president vented about Hur’s findings. The event may have exacerbated Biden’s political problems since he mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico, following several similar occasions last week when he referred to long-dead European leaders with whom he interacted in the 1980s rather their more recent successors. The acute political problem Biden faces was underscored by a new ABC News/Ipsos poll published Sunday in which 86% of Americans said Biden was too old to serve another term. The figure includes 59% of Americans who think both he and Trump are too old and 27% who think only Biden is too old. President Joe Biden speaks at the White House on February 8, 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Here’s Biden’s problem: It’s politically corrosive when a critical narrative takes hold about a president and subsequent events appear to validate it. Every flub or mistake the president makes — after a lifetime of verbal slips and gaffes — now plays into the perception that he’s losing his grip mentally. And his age is a political problem that can’t be fixed. The danger is that voters who see him onstage begin to find it impossible to get past and therefore don’t judge him on his successes as president, his program for a second term or the comparison between him and Trump. Multiple Democrats have attested to Biden’s mental acuity since Thursday. “I have seen the president twice in the last two weeks,” Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” The California lawmaker added: “I have had a conversation with him. He’s completely mentally sharp when we were discussing the Middle East.” But when Biden’s allies are forced to talk about his age, they inevitably draw attention back to the biggest liability for a president who polls show is struggling to create enthusiasm among grassroots Democrats and who may have trouble in reunifying his 2020 coalition, especially when it comes to younger and minority voters. Many Democrats also believe Trump is getting a pass when it comes to age and mental sharpness. While Biden’s missteps get great attention, Trump’s speeches often degenerate into nonsensical reflections. He recently mixed up Haley and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And while his manic presentation style may look energetic and disguise his age in comparison with Biden’s, he’d also be an octogenarian in the White House if he wins a second term. Why the 2020 election lineup may be locked in The renewed focus on Biden’s age is likely to open another round of speculation about whether he could be replaced on the Democratic ticket. But barring some unforeseen health event or a late decision by Biden to fold his campaign, this is highly unlikely. For all the focus on the president’s liabilities, no younger Democrat, with the exception of his long-shot primary rival Rep. Dean Phillips , has emerged to challenge Biden, perhaps to avoid damaging their own political futures. Could the Democratic Party pick an alternative candidate at its summer convention? It’s unlikely. Biden controls the infrastructure of the party — his rejigging of the primary calendar to insulate himself from challenges is proof of that. There’s no sign any major party figure is willing to tell him to step aside or to organize any attempt to topple him. Any convention maneuvering would also follow months of primaries in which Democratic voters are likely to massively endorse Biden, so any attempt to topple him would fly in the face of the democratic principles that Democrats say they are trying to preserve. Had Vice President Kamala Harris been a striking success, there would be more pressure on Biden to yield to a younger successor. But her approval ratings are very low. Haley, for instance, sees Harris as such a political liability that she warns voters they could vote for Biden and get Harris as president. The time for moving on from Trump has also passed. Despite his four indictments, the ex-president’s dominance over Haley and other rivals in early nominating contests has crushed the notion that if only he faced a one-on-one fight, he’d be defeated by anti-Trump forces in the party. So it’s hard to see any way out of the choice America appears not to want. While there are are stark policy differences between Biden and Trump, the 2024 election could still come down to voters picking between Biden’s perceived declining capabilities and Trump’s wild, anti-democratic and autocratic instincts."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/politics/senate-democrats-biden-election-analysis/index.html,"CNN — For Senate Democrats, 2024 is the year of living dangerously. In this fall’s Senate elections, Democrats will be defending more seats in precarious political terrain than in any other election during the 2020s. That list of challenging elections this year includes the final three Senate seats Democrats hold in states that voted for Donald Trump in 2020, and five more in states that President Joe Biden won by 3 percentage points or less. Meanwhile, Republicans this year are not defending any Senate seats in states that voted against Trump in 2020, or preferred him by 3 points or less. That math underlines the stakes for Democrats in Biden improving his position in the key swing states by November. One of the most powerful trends of modern Senate elections is that it has become exceedingly difficult for candidates in either party to win seats in states that usually vote the other way for president. The Senate Democrats running in difficult electoral terrain might break that trend this fall. Yet if they can’t, Biden’s fate in November could determine control of the Senate not only in 2025, but for years thereafter. A strong recovery by Biden in which he wins most of the key swing states could position Democrats to remain competitive in the battle for Senate control through the remainder of this decade, even if they narrowly lose the majority in November. But if Biden loses most of the swing states, Democrats could fall into a Senate deficit too large to realistically overcome for years — especially because the party has so few plausible opportunities to flip seats now held by the GOP. “If the bottom were to drop out for Biden, Democrats could lose the Senate for a long time,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the political newsletter “Sabato’s Crystal Ball,” which is published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. That prospect has enormous implications not only for the passage of legislation but also for the composition of the federal courts, especially the Supreme Court. Four of the Supreme Court justices will be older than 70 by 2028. Even if Biden holds the White House in 2024, and a vacancy arises, a durable Republican Senate majority might refuse to fill any of those seats — just as then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did while Barack Obama was president in 2016. “You can imagine Supreme Court seats going unfilled for years,” Kondik said. The default position for the Senate in the 21st century has been for small and fleeting majorities. In the 12 congressional sessions since 2001, one party or the other has reached 55 Senate seats only three times. By comparison, one party or the other won a majority of 55 or more Senate seats seven times in the 10 sessions from 1980 to 2000. Smaller majorities, not surprisingly, have proved more difficult to defend: In this century, control of the Senate has already flipped in the elections of 2002, 2006, 2014 and 2020. The principal reason the chamber has become so closely divided is the growing correlation between how states vote for president and how they vote for the Senate. That has limited the number of Senate seats each side can win absent unusual circumstances. Through the late 20th century, it was common for voters to split their tickets by electing senators from one party while voting for the presidential nominee of the other. After the 1984 election, for instance, Democrats still held about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for Ronald Reagan in both of his winning presidential campaigns. But now the alignment between presidential and Senate outcomes has become nearly complete. Heading into the 2024 election, Republicans hold 47 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Trump in 2020. Democrats, in turn, hold 48 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Biden last time. This surface equivalence in the two parties’ position in the Senate, though, masks a deeper divergence that largely explains the risk to Democrats this year. While Biden and Trump each won 25 states in 2020, Biden won far more of them by very narrow margins. As a result, Senate Democrats are much more dependent than Republicans on states that lean their way only slightly in the presidential contest. In 2020, Biden won three states by less than a single percentage point: Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. He won three others by less than 3 percentage points: Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan. Democrats now hold 11 of the 12 Senate seats from those six highly competitive states. (Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is the only Republican senator from these states.) President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally in Las Vegas on February 4, 2024. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images By contrast, among the 25 states that backed Trump, North Carolina — where Republicans hold both Senate seats — was the only one Trump carried by less than 3 percentage points. Even extending the net to states Trump won by less than 5 percentage points brings in only Florida, where Republicans also hold both Senate seats. This contrast creates a huge disparity between the parties. Democrats now hold 14 inherently vulnerable Senate seats: their three from the states Trump won in 2020, and their 11 in the states Biden won only narrowly. For Republicans the total is at most six: two in states that Biden won in 2020, and four in states that Trump won narrowly, even with Florida included. “When you have so many states where it is now inconceivable that they could go the other way, Democrats always have to get a straight flush,” said Michael Podhorzer , the former political director for the AFL-CIO. “They’ve got to run the table, because on the basis of what’s safe on either side in the Senate, or the Electoral College, they are at a huge disadvantage.” This year Democrats are defending five of their 11 seats in the states that Biden won by 3 points or less. That’s the biggest concentration of seats from those states Democrats must defend in any single election in this decade, from 2020 through 2028. This year’s Senate races in the narrow Biden states include Democratic incumbents Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, and Jacky Rosen in Nevada; also on the ballot is an open Democratic-held seat in Michigan (where the party is very likely to nominate Rep. Elissa Slotkin) and the Arizona seat held by Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sinema hasn’t indicated whether she will seek reelection, but Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is already running for the seat. (Democrats also face an unexpected challenge in Maryland — a state that leans much more reliably toward them in presidential elections — after GOP former Gov. Larry Hogan last week said he would run for the open seat there.) In addition, Democrats this year must defend all three of their remaining Senate seats in the states that voted for Trump in 2020. That includes incumbents Jon Tester in Montana, Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and the open seat being vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin in West Virginia. Neither of the two remaining Senate Republicans in states that Biden won last time (Susan Collins in Maine and Johnson in Wisconsin) are up this year; nor are either of the GOP senators from North Carolina, the state Trump won by his smallest margin. Both parties agree the open West Virginia seat is virtually guaranteed to flip to the GOP. Tester and Brown both have strong personal brands, but Biden is almost certain to lose their states, and possibly by substantial margins. If he does, Brown and Tester could survive only by breaking a nearly inviolate recent pattern in presidential election years. In 2016, for the first time ever, every Senate race was won by the same party that carried the presidential contest in that state. In 2020, every Senate race again followed the presidential outcome — except in Maine, where Collins won reelection despite Biden’s victory there. This pattern proved especially frustrating to Democrats, who raised enormous sums in 2020 for Senate candidates in Republican-leaning states such as Kentucky, South Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Montana and Texas. Yet when Trump comfortably carried those states in November, all of those Democratic Senate candidates lost as well. A man votes on Election Day on November 3, 2020, in Charleston, South Carolina. Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images This year, with West Virginia likely already gone, if either Brown or Tester loses, it would be very difficult for Democrats to maintain their Senate majority into 2025. The only Republican senators they might plausibly oust to offset those losses are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas. Democrats have recruited strong challengers to each of them, but both of those races clearly lean toward the GOP, especially in a presidential election year. But if Democrats can hold down their Senate losses to some (or even all) of their three seats in the states Trump won in 2020, they would emerge with a deficit small enough to overcome in upcoming elections. The real long-term risk for the party this November is losing several of their Senate seats in the states Biden narrowly carried last time. (Hogan’s bid in Maryland adds a wild card, but the probability that Biden wins Maryland will likely leave Hogan as an underdog despite his personal popularity.) If Democrats lose Senate seats in the narrow Biden states, they simply have very few places on the map to replace them, given the parties’ patterns of support. It’s that prospect that has led the Democratic data analyst David Shor to warn for years that if the party doesn’t perform well in the 2024 presidential election, the GOP could seize control of the Senate for a sustained period. Shor would not comment on the Democrats’ Senate situation, but many other analysts see a dangerous convergence: The party must defend an unusually large number of seats in terrain that is highly contested at the presidential level precisely as Biden is struggling in polls against Trump. “There is a real downside risk that if the presidential election goes poorly, the Republicans could not only win the Senate but build something of a cushion that would be hard for Democrats to cut into in the near future,” Kondik said. Gene Ulm, a Republican pollster who has worked for many Senate candidates, agrees that what happens in the narrow Biden 2020 states this fall will cast a huge shadow on control of the Senate through the decade. If Republicans capture Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, he said, the reaction in the political world would not be “gosh, shock, alert the media,” he said. “It’s one thing for Republicans to recapture those states that have been habitually red,” Ulm said, but “if all of a sudden you have Republicans winning places that are historically purple,” that creates a very different situation going forward. The best-case scenario for Democrats is that Biden recovers enough to win most or all of the five battleground states where the party is also defending Senate seats. Many on both sides agree that it will be difficult for Republicans to flip any of those Democratic-held seats if Biden wins the state — with Arizona a possible exception if Sinema creates a three-way race. Of the Democrats running in the narrow Biden states, Casey in Pennsylvania and Baldwin in Wisconsin are probably best positioned to win even the president he loses their state, many in both parties agree. Brown and Tester also have deep roots that could allow them to survive Biden defeats as well. But in this era of greater party-line voting, it won’t be easy for any candidate to overcome such an undertow: Hardly any Senate Democrats in competitive races ran even 2 percentage points ahead of Biden’s vote share in 2020. Ulm sees two keys to the Senate outcomes in the competitive swing states. One is the choices in the Senate races by voters who back third-party presidential candidates out of distaste for both Biden and Trump, assuming they face each other again; it is very difficult at this point, Ulm said, to predict how those disaffected voters will vote in Senate (and House) races. For Ulm, the other key question is what happens with the voters who are slightly negative about Biden. He is confident Republican Senate candidates will romp among voters who strongly disapprove of Biden, as they did in 2022. But one reason Democrats blunted the anticipated 2022 red wave is their congressional and gubernatorial candidates ran unusually well among voters who only “somewhat disapproved” of Biden — largely because many of those voters considered the Trump-allied GOP alternatives too extreme. Electoral workers process ballots in Easton, Pennsylvania, on November 3, 2020. Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images That risk to the GOP remains. “The soft disapprovers are going to be a much more competitive constituency, just like 2022,” Ulm said. David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, notes that in the 2022 midterm election, Democrats won Senate races in most of these same battleground states, although exit polls showed substantial discontent with the economy and Biden’s performance then, too. “Senate campaigns are candidate versus candidate battles,” Bergstein said. “We have the superior candidates, and Republicans are putting forward candidates who have big flaws, who lost races before, or are facing the prospect of damaging primaries. Certainly a presidential cycle is different than a midterm, but the laws of Senate campaigns, where candidate quality matters, are still in effect.” Gary Jacobson, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of California at San Diego who specializes in Congress, said that given the fissures opening in each party’s coalition during the Trump era, no one should rule out the possibility that either side may develop new opportunities that reconfigure the Senate’s precarious balance. “This structural disadvantage the Democrats have is a real thing and it will make it an uphill battle for them to control the Senate for the foreseeable future,” Jacobson said. “But the foreseeable future is pretty short. Political configurations are not cut in stone.” Unless and until such a new political configuration emerges, both parties can realistically target many fewer Senate seats than they could even two decades ago. But the ceiling is clearly lower for Democrats than for Republicans. It leaves Democrats, even in good years, with achingly little margin for error to build a Senate majority. And unless Biden recovers more strength, 2024 may be very far from anything Democrats would call a good year."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — As the two-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, it feels like everyone has been sucked into a bizarro world. ► Two years ago, in February 2022, Tucker Carlson was a Fox News host, still adjacent to mainstream US politics. ► US support for Ukraine seemed ironclad and unflappable as Russia invaded. ► Russian President Vladimir Putin was about to be isolated worldwide as a pariah. ► Elon Musk would soon commit to helping Ukraine with his Starlink satellite internet system. ► Former President Donald Trump was still plotting his way out of the political wilderness, his presence rarely felt by most of the country. What a difference two years makes Some developments this week: ► Putin got a platform, thanks to a softball interview by Carlson, who was banished from Fox News last year and has turned to Twitter, the platform Musk bought and renamed X, to spew right-wing conspiracy theories. ► American aid for Ukraine is in real question as US politicians, led by Republicans in the House of Representatives, question the investment. Note: When Trump helped kill a bipartisan border policy bill this week, it also put Ukraine aid sought for months by President Joe Biden in jeopardy. ► Trump’s emergence from the wilderness is complete. He has all but erased any question he will be the Republican presidential nominee for the third time and is plotting his return to the White House. The Pentagon, by the way, is now paying Musk’s SpaceX for Ukraine to use Starlink. Video Ad Feedback Russia expert says this is what Putin hoped to get from Carlson interview 02:06 - Source: CNN A propaganda broadcast on X Carlson was walked on by Putin during the interview in Moscow. CNN’s Oliver Darcy called it a “propaganda victory” for Putin. From Darcy: Instead of pressing Putin on the many topics at hand, including credible accusations Russia has committed war crimes and the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Carlson allowed the autocrat a free lane to manipulate the public and tell his version of history, no matter how deceptive it may have been. At times, between the airing of grievances, Putin appeared to school Carlson on historical events as the host looked on in bewilderment. Or to put it more plainly, Carlson provided Putin a platform to spread his propaganda to a global audience with little to no scrutiny of his claims. In one notable exchange, Carlson did push back on the idea that Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia since last March, is a US spy. According to CNN’s reporting, Russia rejected an offer to exchange a large number of Russian nationals detained abroad for both Gershkovich and another American, Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since 2018. Putin told Carlson that perhaps Gershkovich could be exchanged for Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel in Russia’s domestic spying service who was convicted for murdering a former Chechen fighter in Berlin in broad daylight in 2019. CNN’s Nathan Hodge, Katharina Krebs and Helen Regan have more details . They also fact-check Carlson on his assertion that US media organizations have not tried to interview Putin. From their report: In fact, journalists have repeatedly been requesting interviews with Putin, but the Russian president had declined to grant access. And Putin not only has declined to participate in interviews with the free press, but over the past two years he has waged a war against the media, locking up journalists , fining Big Tech companies for hosting “fake” information about the Ukraine invasion, and pushing through censorship laws that clamp down on news organizations. Video Ad Feedback Amanpour pushes back on Tucker Carlson's claim about Putin interview 02:13 - Source: CNN Putin, despite the free platform from Carlson, still faces isolation in the West. The CNN reporters note the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin regarding an alleged scheme to take Ukrainian children to Russia. And there was a new call Thursday for Putin to face a war crimes inquiry for Russia’s assault on the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which killed thousands. The reporters also used the word “revanchist,” which I had to look up and which perfectly describes Putin’s warped view of history and his obsession with occupying Ukraine. From Merriam-Webster: (re·​vanch·​ist) of or relating to a policy designed to recover lost territory or status. Shakeup in Ukraine Meantime, there are major developments in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky this week replaced his top military commander, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. From CNN’s report : The president’s move follows tensions between Zelensky and his hugely popular military chief after the failure of Ukraine’s much-vaunted counteroffensive, and with Ukraine facing a renewed Russian onslaught, manpower and ammunition shortages, and US aid stalled in Congress. Major choices for Americans But among the many, concrete choices Americans face in November, assuming the presidential election is between Trump and Biden, is how the US president will approach Putin. Biden has his built his presidency around the idea of a worldwide struggle between democracies and autocracies. Trump frequently expresses admiration for autocrats and his frustration with democratic alliances like NATO. Ukraine funding has run dry The Pentagon has essentially exhausted the money Congress allocated for Ukraine over the past two years. It’s unclear when more might be on the way, particularly after the proposal to tie US border policy to Ukraine funding met its end this week. In the Senate, there is support for Ukraine aid. A bipartisan group of senators on Thursday cleared a 60-vote threshold to move toward a $95 billion aid bill for Ukraine and Israel. One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, plans to use arcane procedural tactics to stall a final vote for days . Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, pushed back against criticism from right-wing lawmakers that the money is charity for Ukraine. Most of the funds would be spent on production of military hardware in the US, he said. “This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy and demonstrating to our allies and adversaries alike that we’re serious about exercising American strength,” he said on the Senate floor on Friday. The House is a more formidable roadblock to additional Ukraine funding. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has not ruled out the idea of approving a Ukraine bill, either as a stand-alone proposition or in conjunction with aid to Israel. But he has certainly not endorsed it either. Johnson, along with other Republicans, has demanded more transparency and accountability for how the money is spent. And to get more aid passed into law, he would likely need Democratic votes – which will anger hard-line Republicans who have the power to oust him."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/politics/biden-age-concerns-analysis/index.html,"CNN — A probe that spared President Joe Biden from criminal charges paradoxically dealt him a threatening political blow. Special counsel Robert Hur’s report released Thursday on Biden’s handling of classified documents effectively ended the matter. But his assertions that Biden was elderly and forgetful ignited a political firestorm that cut directly to the heart of the president’s chief vulnerability in the 2024 election. The White House knew it had a huge political problem on its hands. undefined — President Joe Biden speaks in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, Thursday, Feb. 8, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Evan Vucci/AP Related article Takeaways from special counsel’s report into Biden’s handling of classified documents After hours of Republican claims that the report showed he wasn’t capable of serving as president, Biden appeared at a hastily scheduled news conference Thursday evening, apparently seeking to turn the page on what turned into a disastrous day. “I know what the hell I am doing,” Biden fumed in the Diplomatic Room of the White House, as he defended his faculties and bristled with anger. Biden also pointed out that Hur’s report drew distinctions between his handling of classified material and Donald Trump ’s allegedly criminal and obstructive conduct on the same issue over which the ex-president faces a future criminal trial. Biden appeared fired up and passionate. But at the same time, his angry demeanor and an event which appeared to quickly spin out of his control, with reporters shouting questions as he struggled to interrupt, may have ended up exacerbating the very questions about his age that it was meant to dispel. When CNN’s MJ Lee pointed out that many voters have questions about his age, Biden pointed his finger and forcibly said, “That’s your judgment.” Story highlights Biden's age and acuity matter to voters and he is under increasing pressure to address this and demonstrate his capacity as the general election approaches. Age is an issue that many families have to wrestle with and so understand intuitively, a factor that may be reflected in public opinion on the matter as it relates to the election. This is a delicate issue that has not been fully tackled either by the White House or the Biden campaign. The press event also raised new questions about his sharpness in a week in which he has twice confused the names of a serving and recent European leader with those with whom he interacted in the 1980s. At one point in his Thursday night appearance, Biden was referring to the president of Egypt in a comment about the Middle East crisis but mistakenly said “the president of Mexico.” This is the kind of mistake any overworked politician might make. And even when he was much younger, Biden had a reputation as a gaffe machine and for verbal slips. But in the context of Biden’s declaration that his “memory is fine” his political liability over his age and coming as it did during an event meant to demonstrate vitality and accurate recall, it was an unwelcome trip-up, to say the least. An emotional moment There was also a poignant moment where palpable grief came to the surface when the president condemned Hur for suggesting that in an interview he struggled to remember the date of his beloved son Beau’s death. It’s hard to think of a more painful thing for Biden to have to read since he remains deeply affected by his son’s passing from brain cancer in 2015. “How the hell dare he raise that?” Biden asked, before breaking off, apparently close to tears. Overall, Biden left an impression of a president who feels he’s been deeply wronged, is bitter about the way he is covered by the media and treated by Republicans and still believes deeply he is the best option to beat Trump in November — an opponent that he views as an anti-democratic anathema to everything America stands for. The president’s defenders often get frustrated when the political conversation is dominated by Biden’s age – rather than Trump’s repeated challenges to the rule of law.

Sure, Biden’s likely Republican opponent is a twice-impeached 77-year-old with a volcanic temperament who is facing 91 charges and tried to thwart US democracy three years ago. But Biden is the president now, and despite the preferred framing of his campaign that 2024 is a direct comparison between him and Trump, he will be judged on his own record and capability to serve as commander-in-chief for a full four years, especially as Vice President Kamala Harris has her own questions to answer about her experience, popularity and suitability to serve in the Oval Office. In a CNN/SSRS poll published in November, only 25% of Americans believed Biden had the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively, while 53% said Trump did. In another CNN poll last week, 46% of Democrats were concerned about Biden’s age. This is a delicate issue that has not been fully tackled either by the White House or the Biden campaign and is often rationalized away by Democrats and in Washington in a way that does not fully reflect the depth of feeling about it in the nation as a whole. The fact that Biden delivered his remarks on Thursday night shows that his team now recognizes the president has a significant liability in this area but his performance also suggests that he’s yet to fully work out how to put voters at ease. A painful issue Age and the question of diminished capacities as a person heads into their twilight years is a deeply painful and sensitive one. It’s something that many families have to wrestle with and so understand intuitively, a factor that may be reflected in public opinion on the matter as it relates to the election. Many of the attacks on Biden by Republicans certainly reek of ageism and come across as cruel. As Biden knows however, politics is a nasty, personal business. In mitigation, he has kept up a rigorous schedule on the campaign trail in recent weeks traveling coast-to-coast and last year conducted several grueling foreign trips that would have tired a much younger man. But the pressures of the presidency are unrelenting and offer little time for true mental relief. This is underscored by the fact that Biden is for example dealing with two wars in Ukraine and Gaza that constantly threaten to spill out of control and embroil the world in a much wider conflict. Biden’s fans may also have a case that he’s being unfairly compared with Trump. The ex-president — despite a few recent glaring gaffes himself — notably mixing up his GOP rival Nikki Haley with ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — has not had the same scrutiny over age even though he’d be into his 80s by the end of his own second term if he wins in November. Trump’s often nonsensical remarks, verbal gaffes and frequently unhinged demeanor are often cited by Democrats and raise questions about his age and capacity. But Trump’s manic energy tends to dampen such questions among his supporters, although there are arguably great red flags about his fitness for office raised by his four looming criminal trials and his open autocratic tendencies and vows to use a second term to enact personal “retribution” against his political enemies. Hur’s report rebuked Biden for willfully retaining classified information, including top secret documents after he left the vice presidency. But he said no charges were called for because there was insufficient evidence of willful intent to prove guilt without reasonable doubt. He also also drew a distinction between Biden’s handling of classified material after documents were found at his home, his garage and in an office that he used and Trump’s hoarding of classified material at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Biden cooperated with his probe while Trump is alleged to have done the opposite, according to a criminal indictment that also accuses him of obstruction. The facts show that there are huge differences in the cases of Biden and Trump — even if the nuance will be blurred in the heat of a campaign as GOP leaders complain of double standards in the justice system. But the GOP’s real opening came when Hur suggested that Biden would come across to a jury as a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man “with a poor memory.” Hur suggested that he had frequent memory lapses during his interviews with investigators, including not being able to recall when Beau died or exactly when Biden was vice president. The special counsel also said the president could not remember details of a debate over Afghanistan that appeared very important to him. Biden’s lawyers lashed out at such details as inappropriate. Biden’s allies suggested that as Hur was appointed as a district attorney in Maryland by Trump he may have a political ax to grind. In private, the findings touched off a furious response from Biden, with the president angrily and profanely asking how anyone could believe he would forget the day his son died, CNN’s Kevin Liptak reported . Many of the Republican attacks on Biden were biting. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio suggested on Twitter for instance that he was suffering from dementia. North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis was kinder but his comments over Biden’s age were also cutting. “I’m not one who gets personal. But when it’s so profound, that you have a prosecutor take note of it, I think it’s something to pay attention to,” Tillis said. “I’m not trying to take a cheap shot. …  Let’s say that was the CEO of a company. What would their board of directors be asking for this evening?” The reality of an unprecedented election Democrats moved quickly to dismiss concerns about Biden. “In my interactions with the president, which I have regularly, I’ve not experienced anything like that,” said Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. “When I came back from Ukraine the last time, I spent a good amount of time with him on the phone, talking about Ukraine and the details, and he was sharp.” But the fact Democrats even have to address this, points to Biden’s big political problem. And the entire situation is replete with irony. Biden acted aggressively Thursday to try to prevent a report that lifted the threat of criminal prosecution from him but already appears to have damaged him politically because of questions about his age. Trump meanwhile is facing four criminal trials that paradoxically appear to have benefitted him politically — at least with his deeply loyal base which has bought into his claims that he’s a victim of political persecution. That may not seem fair. But for Biden, it comes with being an incumbent president in his 80s who is facing genuine questions from the public about his capacity to serve. This also reflects the sometimes warped reality of politics in the age of Trump and an unprecedented election between two elderly likely opponents in November, each of whom have served an Oval Office term and have defied the efforts of a younger generation to succeed them."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/south-carolina-trump-haley-voters/index.html,"Pawleys Island, South Carolina CNN — Joy Rendulic was hesitant when her husband first suggested a move to South Carolina. Then she visited a small ice cream shop for sale near the spectacular coast of this barrier island town. Rendulic cashed in her 401(k) to buy it, and left Erie, Pennsylvania, behind. “God brought me here,” Rendulic told us during a break at Island Treats ice cream shop. “I thought I was doing what I was supposed to be doing for the rest of my life, and he had a different plan. We think we are in control. But we’re not.” The big move was in 2016. Nikki Haley was the governor then, and newcomer Rendulic was impressed. “Yes, she was a very good governor,” Rendulic said. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, in December 2023. Carlos Barria/Reuters/File Related article CNN Poll: Most Americans want verdict on Trump election subversion charges before 2024 vote Donald Trump won her vote for president that same year, again in 2020 and will once more when Trump and Haley square off in the South Carolina GOP presidential primary this month. “I totally believe that God has assigned him to this position,” Rendulic said of Trump.  “That is my true belief.” We ask what happened in 2020. “That was a mess,” Rendulic said. “That was so illegal. Some improper cheating happening to the voting procedures.” We mention all the recounts and court cases Trump lost, including cases decided by judges Trump appointed, that upheld now-President Joe Biden’s victory. “I think so many people hate Trump,” she said. “I just know there was a whole lot of cheating.” There is no evidence of that, but Rendulic is adamant. So we ask, if it was God’s plan for Trump to be president, why would God let that happen? The answer is halting. “What happened is what happened. And I believe Trump is coming again.” Rendulic represents an important slice of the Trump base: for Trump no matter what. These voters echo his false claims about rigged elections and bogus investigations and they stand by Trump even when he does things counter to their priorities. You find a lot of them in South Carolina, one reason Trump consistently leads the primary polls despite Haley’s home state status. Rendulic, for example, lists abortion – or the “right to life,” as she puts it – as the reason her last vote for a Democrat for president was Jimmy Carter. But she offers no criticism of Trump when we point out he has recently criticized some state abortion restrictions as too harsh and has warned it could be a losing issue for Republicans. “I haven’t thought about that too much, probably,” Rendulic said. “I want it to be right to life.” No doubt Trump gets her vote. “He’s even more ready now and very, very intelligent, cares a lot about this country,” she said. “Wants to do what is right.” Looking for a tough border ‘fix’ from Trump Billy Pierce is another piece of the Trump comeback puzzle. He has lived in Hartsville – about two hours inland from the South Carolina coast – all his 70 years except for a stint in the Navy. Pierce says he was drawn to Trump in 2016 for the same reason he backed Ross Perot in 1992. “I wanted a non-career politician in there that would do, would run it like a company,” Pierce said in an interview in the garage office where he organizes his part-time consulting work. Pierce sees Biden as too unwilling to stand up to the Democratic left and has fond memories of the pre-Covid economy during the Trump administration. “We didn’t have the high inflation,” he said. “We didn’t have the high interest rates.” Pierce is not an election denier. He does believe it was wrong that many states adopted new voting rules during the 2020 pandemic, but said Trump should have honored the results once all his challenges were exhausted. Nor is Pierce a fan of the former president’s toxic tone. “If he’d just shut up and, you know, got off Twitter and that kind of stuff, he’d have made a great president,” Pierce said. He called himself a likely Trump voter in the primary and described the choice between Trump and Haley as “the lesser of two evils.” Billy Pierce talks to John King in Hartsville, South Carolina. CNN But Pierce is very much in line with Trump on policy matters. “He’s going to fix the things I need him to fix,” Pierce said, listing the border as his top priority. “Shut it down,” is Pierce’s desire, though he agrees with Trump that congressional Republicans should not pass a border package before the November election – even if it would slow the flow of illegal border crossings. “This is a Democratic ploy” designed to help Biden, Pierce said. He offers a suggestion on what he would do at the border, based on his time in the military. “Have us put up razor wire,” Pierce said. “I have no problem with putting up two rows and mining the other. So if they come in, you tell them it is mined. You put signs out there that says it’s mined.” He balances such tough talk with a personal story about his daughter adopting two children from Guatemala. Be tough at the border now, Pierce said, and then conversations about more legal immigration would be possible. “It needs to be done the right way.” From sending a message to DC to sending a message to the next generation Craig Thomas lived in Tennessee when Trump caught his attention in 2016. Thomas describes himself as “conservative, some areas libertarian.” Trump, he thought then, was an outsider – and a vote for him would send a message to Washington. “It was like, alright, like this is good,” said Thomas. “Let’s blow some things up.” Now, Thomas lives in Charleston and is voting for Haley – to send a message to his two children. Craig Thomas talks to John King in Charleston, South Carolina. CNN He is tired of all the personal attacks and all the anger and wants a president who is also a role model. Haley, he said, “brings very similar policy positions, but definitely without the drama.” One recent MAGA conspiracy theory hit too close to home. “I don’t think there’s any sort of a crazy conspiracy between the NFL and Taylor Swift and everything else just showing up for a Biden coronation,” Thomas said. “How do I look at my daughter, who is a huge Taylor Swift fan, and this guy just attacking Taylor Swift, just because she is going to support another candidate, right.” “And other things like that. And having those conversations with them. It does matter. And it does matter who you support.” Trump as a religion Charleston is rich with both Revolutionary and Civil War history, a place where you can still ride a horse-drawn carriage down a cobblestone street. It is more affluent, more educated and less Trumpy than most of South Carolina. “But there is quite a bit of talk about Trump, even here,” Thomas said. Mark Sanford is out of politics because of that – because of the reach of the Trump Republican revolution. Sanford served in the House representing a Charleston-area district, and then was the state’s two-term Republican governor just before Haley was first elected in 2010. Sanford won his old House seat back in 2013, but then lost the Republican primary in 2018 because he was a sharp critic of then-President Trump’s fiscal policies, and sometimes of his tone. “I would say, ‘Well I’m for Trump in this area, but I’m against in these different areas.’ But people didn’t want nuance. They want: ‘Are you for or against him.’” Sanford wouldn’t directly answer when asked how he will vote in this month’s primary. But he did offer this: “I’ve never voted for Trump so far. I know that I’m not voting for him this time. I’ll let you read the tea leaves from that.” John King talks to Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman from the Charleston area. CNN Sanford agrees when Haley goes after Trump for all the “chaos,” and especially when she highlights the deficit spending of the Trump years. Yet he expects a big Trump win in South Carolina, because the GOP electorate is so different now from when he was first elected. “What has traditionally worked in GOP politics isn’t so much working these days,” he said in an interview at his home in the Charleston suburb of Mount Pleasant. “He became sort of a proxy litmus test for ‘Are you for or against the system,’” Sanford said. “I’ve seen this erosion,” Sanford said. “Sort of Perot movement to Tea Party to Trump. It’s metastasized in ever aggressive forms. And what started out as a lot of well meaning Americans saying, ‘Look, we’ve got to do something about politicians doing what they said they were going to do’ (has evolved) into something much more strident. … It is their religion. I mean, I, I don’t know how else to explain it.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/fact-check-trump-nato/index.html,"Washington CNN — For a third straight presidential election campaign, former President Donald Trump is being serially inaccurate about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance. Trump caused a transatlantic uproar this weekend by claiming at a Saturday campaign rally that he had once told the president of a “big” NATO country that if that country didn’t pay its “bills,” he would not protect the country from a Russian invasion and would even “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want.” Trump’s incendiary remarks contained a familiar false claim. His assertion about NATO allies supposedly having failed to pay “bills” is not true, as fact-checkers at CNN and elsewhere have pointed out for years. And Trump has for years made a variety of other false claims about spending by NATO and its members. Here is a fact check of five of his repeated statements. Spending by NATO members Trump has long claimed that various NATO members have failed to pay their “ bills ,” “ dues ” or “ NATO fees ,” that they “ owe us a tremendous amount of money ” or that they “ owe NATO billions of dollars .” Facts First: All of these Trump claims are false. While a majority of NATO members do not meet the alliance’s target of each member spending a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, the 2% target is a “guideline ” that does not create bills, debts or legal obligations if it is not met. In fact, the guideline doesn’t require payments to NATO or the US at all. Rather, it simply requires each country to spend on their own defense programs. When Trump was president, the guideline was written in forgiving language that made clear that it was not a firm commitment. That version of the guideline, created at a NATO summit in Wales in 2014, said members that had yet to reach 2% would “aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade with a view to meeting their NATO Capability Targets and filling NATO’s capability shortfalls.” In other words, the members that were below 2% in 2014 didn’t even have to promise to hit the target by 2024 – simply to make an effort to do so by then. NATO does require members to make direct contributions to fund the organization’s own operations. But there is no sign that members have failed to make those contributions, which constitute a tiny fraction of the allies’ defense spending, and Trump has made clear that his talk of debts  is about the 2% guideline. Stephen Saideman , the Paterson Chair in International Affairs at Carleton University in Canada, said in a Monday email that the word “inaccurate really does not cover Trump’s protection racket/country club perception of dues owed to the US.” “The money, as you and everyone else knows, is not sent from member states to the US or NATO (although there is a common fund that pays for the buildings in Brussels and elsewhere but it is not that much money and is not the focus of the 2% discussions). The commitment is for each country to spend enough on their own militaries – 2% of GDP, 20% of defense spending on equipment – so that the alliance as a whole is capable and can credibly deter Russia and do whatever else the alliance agrees to,” Saideman said. As of 2023, 11 of 30 NATO members were meeting the 2% target, NATO estimates show . That was up from three members in 2014. Erwan Lagadec , a research professor at George Washington University’s ﻿Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, noted in a Monday email that NATO members agreed to firmer language related to the 2% target in 2023, formally declaring that “we make an enduring commitment to invest at least 2% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually on defence.” Lagadec said that “arguably for the first time the Allies HAVE made a hard commitment to reaching 2% (indeed, to reaching at least 2%) rather than merely ‘trying to get there if possible.’” He noted, though, that even this stronger declaration “doesn’t provide a deadline” to hit 2%. Regardless, it will not create actual debts to the US or NATO. NATO members’ spending before Trump took office As president, Trump claimed that NATO members’ spending had declined “every single year” until he took office in 2017. He sometimes claimed there had been 15 , 16 or 18 years of declines. Facts First : Trump’s claims that NATO members’ spending had declined every year until he took office are false. Official NATO data show that non-US members’ defense spending increased in each of the two years prior to Trump’s presidency – by 1.6% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016. The increases came after NATO members recommitted to the 2%-of-GDP guideline at the 2014 summit in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region . Non-US members’ defense spending increases in each year of the Trump era were bigger than their increases in 2015 and 2016 – the increases were 5.9% in 2017, 4.3% in 2018, 3.6% in 2019 and 4.6% in 2020 – and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg gave Trump at least partial credit . But Trump is wrong when he claims he reversed a downward trend. “If you look at the year-on-year data, the turning point away from the nadir of European defense spending happened in 2014, pre-Trump, and clearly due to Crimea,” Lagadec said. Saideman said that while it’s possible he is undervaluing Trump’s impact because he generally dislikes Trump, “Putin deserves most of the credit for defense spending increases in Europe.” He said, “Everyone was cutting their defense budgets after the 2008 economic crisis and as countries started pulling out of Afghanistan, and all that changed with the seizure of Crimea.” And he argued that any increases sparked by Trump are likely less about his efforts to cajole allies than about those allies’ concerns about the US no longer keeping its commitments given what has sounded from Trump like “genuine hostility to the alliance and to the allies.” Under President Joe Biden, non-US NATO members increased their defense spending by 2.8% in 2021 and an estimated 2.0% in 2022, then by an estimated 8.3% in 2023. That large 2023 spike was “clearly in reaction to the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine” in 2022, Lagadec said. The US share of NATO spending As president, Trump repeatedly claimed that, before him, the US was “ paying for 100% of NATO ” or “ paying close to 100% .” Facts First : Trump’s claims are false. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members – a large majority, but not “100%” or “close to 100%.” And Trump’s claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover NATO’s organizational expenses and are set based on each country’s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016 . The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 68% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany; Lagadec said the US share was reduced from 22% “to placate Trump” and is a “sweetheart deal” given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance’s total GDP . What previous presidents told NATO members As president, Trump repeatedly claimed that before he pressured NATO members to increase their defense spending, US presidents did not even ask them to do so. He singled out former President Barack Obama in his comments at the rally on Saturday. After referring to NATO members Trump said he pressured himself, he continued: “And then I hear that they like Obama better. They should like Obama better. You know why? Because he didn’t ask for anything.” Facts First : Trump’s claims are false. Both Obama and his predecessor, President George W. Bush , repeatedly pressed other NATO members to spend more on defense, though t heir public language was less confrontational than Trump’s. At a news conference in Belgium in 2014, Obama said , “ If we’ve got collective defense, it means that everybody has got to chip in. And I have had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO – not all, but many. The trend lines have been going down.” In a speech in Germany in 2016, Obama said , “Every NATO member should be contributing its full share – 2% of GDP – towards our common security, something that doesn’t always happen. And I’ll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense.” In a speech to Canada’s Parliament in 2016, he said , “As your ally and as your friend, let me say that we’ll be more secure when every NATO member, including Canada, contributes its full share to our common security.” In a speech in the Czech Republic in 2002, before a NATO summit, Bush said that every NATO member needs to make a military contribution to the alliance, and “f or some allies, this will require higher defense spending.” Bush and top administration officials continued for the rest of his presidency to push for increased spending. While visiting Romania in 2008, Bush said , “Building a strong NATO alliance also requires a strong European defense capacity. So at this summit, I will encourage our European partners to increase their defense investments to support both NATO and EU operations.” The cost of NATO’s headquarters While criticizing NATO both during and after his presidency, Trump has claimed that NATO spent $3 billion on its headquarters building in Belgium. Facts First: Trump’s $3 billion figure is not close to accurate. NATO told CNN in 2020 that the headquarters building was constructed for a sum under the approved budget of 1.178 billion euro, or about $1.27 billion at Monday exchange rates – certainly an expensive facility, but less than half what Trump has claimed."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/politics/fact-check-biden-makes-three-false-claims-about-his-handling-of-classified-information/index.html,"CNN — President Joe Biden gave a press conference Thursday night after the release of a report from special counsel Robert Hur, who announced that Biden would not face charges over his handling of classified information from prior to his presidency. Biden was combative , forcefully rejecting Hur’s claims that he has a poor memory. But the president was also repeatedly inaccurate, making three claims that were clearly contradicted by Hur’s report. Here is a fact check. Where the classified material was stored Biden sought to contrast his handling of classified material with that of former President Donald Trump, who faces felony charges for willfully retaining classified documents . (Hur agreed that there were major distinctions between the two cases .) But while Biden correctly noted that the documents were in a private home that is very different from the Mar-a-Lago social club where Trump lives, Biden embellished his argument with a false claim. Biden said: “All the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.” Facts First: Biden’s claim is not true. The special counsel’s report says that while some of the classified documents were found in cabinet drawers in Biden’s Delaware home, other classified documents, about Afghanistan, were found in an “unsealed” and “badly damaged” box sitting in his garage alongside an assortment of other items the special counsel described as “household detritus.” The report includes a photo of the box. Hur wrote that investigators looked into the possibility that the Afghanistan-related documents found in the box were previously stored in a filing cabinet when Biden lived in a rented home in Virginia before moving out in 2019. Hur called that line of inquiry “inconclusive.” Regardless, Biden’s Thursday claim that “all” of the documents in his home were in locked or lockable filing cabinets is not true of his current home. According to the special counsel, even classified documents Biden was storing elsewhere in his home were insufficiently secure. Hur wrote that Biden notebooks containing classified information from his vice presidency were found by investigators in “unlocked drawers in the office and basement den” of the home. Hur wrote that Biden “should have known” that as a private citizen as of 2017, “he was not permitted to keep handwritten notes about the President’s Daily Brief and other classified information in unlocked drawers in his home.” At a White House briefing on Friday, Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the White House Counsel’s Office, would not directly answer when asked about Biden’s claims about the security of the documents held at his home. “Look, I think the president was trying to address a number of inaccurate allegations in this … report,” Sams told CNN’s MJ Lee. “I don’t have anything … to add on what he said last night.” Asked later whether he was saying the special counsel’s report was inaccurate about the storage of documents, Sams again avoided responding directly. “The report lays out in 400 pages of detail all of the evidence and all of the review that they conducted in looking into this matter,” he said. “The president made sure that all of the classified documents that were found were returned promptly to the government, which is what you’re supposed to do, which is why this is the inevitable conclusion that there is no case here.” When the reporter pressed Sams, saying that wasn’t a response to his question, Sams replied: “I understand what you’re trying to ask.” He did not respond further to the question. The classification level of the documents Biden had in his possession Biden claimed of the documents he possessed: “None of it was high classified. It didn’t have any of that red stuff on it, you know what I mean, around the corners? None of that.” Facts First : Biden’s claim that none of the classified material found in his possession was highly classified is false, according to details provided by the special counsel. Hur reported the discovery of documents in Biden’s possession that had markings identifying them as “Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information,” a very high level of classification – plus handwritten notebooks from Biden’s time as vice president that weren’t marked as classified but that “contain information that remains classified up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information level.” It’s not clear whether any of the marked classified documents found in Biden’s possession had the colored borders seen on some of the marked classified documents found in Trump’s possession , which is what Biden appeared to be referring to when he spoke about “that red stuff…around the corners.” Regardless, Hur explained at length that some of the documents were marked as Top Secretand some with other notations identifying them as highly classified. For example, Hur wrote, the open box in Biden’s garage contained an Afghanistan-related memo from the National Security Adviser to President Barack Obama in 2009 marked “TOP SECRET/SCI” (Sensitive Compartmented Information). Hur wrote that experts in the intelligence community said the document contains “highly sensitive information about the military programs of the United States and a foreign government. The unauthorized disclosure of this information, both today and in 2017 when Mr. Biden was no longer vice president, reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.” Hur wrote that the box in the garage contained another 2009 memo from the National Security Adviser to Obama marked “TOP SECRET WITH TOP SECRET/NOFORN/CODEWORD ATTACHMENTS” with attachments, one of which was marked “TOP SECRET//HUMINT/COMINT//ORCON/NOFORN//FISA.”Hur wrote that experts said “portions of this document contain national defense information about sensitive intelligence sources and methods.” In addition, Hur wrote that notebooks with handwritten notes Biden took during his vice presidency contained information on “U.S. intelligence sources, methods, and capabilities,” “U.S. intelligence activities” and “the activities of foreign intelligence services,” among other things. Hur wrote that when investigators looked into a sampling of 37 excerpts from Biden’s handwritten materials that appeared to be classified, they found that “eight are Top Secret with Sensitive Compartmented Information, seven of which include information concerning human intelligence sources,” while six are Top Secret alone, 21 Secret and two Confidential. “Mr. Biden wrote down obviously sensitive information discussed during intelligence briefings with then President Obama and meetings in the White House Situation Room about matters of national security and military and foreign policy,” Hur wrote. What Hur said Biden said to his ghostwriter Hur said in the report that Biden disclosed classified material from his notebooks to the ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer,  who worked with him on a 2017 memoir called “Promise Me, Dad.” But Biden categorically denied that he had shared classified information with the ghostwriter, saying he can “guarantee” he didn’t. When a reporter responded that the special counsel said he did, Biden responded, “No, they did not say that. He did not say that.” Facts First : Biden’s claim is false. Hur did say that, writing explicitly that “Mr. Biden shared information, including some classified information, from those notebooks with his ghostwriter.” He elaborated that Biden shared classified information with his ghostwriter by reading “nearly verbatim” from his notebooks “on at least three occasions,” including his “notes from meetings in the Situation Room.” Hur did find, however, that Biden “at times” tried to avoid sharing classified information, by stopping at or skipping over certain material from the notebooks. And he wrote that “the evidence does not show that when Mr. Biden shared the specific passages with his ghostwriter, Mr. Biden knew the passages were classified and intended to share classified information.” Hur wrote that in one recorded conversation with the ghostwriter in 2017, at the Virginia home where Biden then lived, Biden read from his notebook about a National Security Council meeting about Iraq in 2015, then told the ghostwriter about a 2009 memo he had written to Obama arguing against the deployment of more troops to Afghanistan – and then said, “I just found all the classified stuff downstairs.” Hur noted that more than five years later, investigators found classified documents about the Afghanistan troop surge in Biden’s Delaware garage. Hur wrote that he has not heard of any allegations that classified material actually appeared in Biden’s 2017 memoir. This story has been updated with additional reaction.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/politics/kfile-whatley-promoted-false-election-fraud-claims/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump and his allies are pushing to replace the chair of the Republican National Committee with North Carolina’s party leader who promoted 2020 presidential election lies and supported using the courts to overturn the results. Michael Whatley, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, shared false claims that Republican observers were prevented from accessing polling locations and repeatedly said Democratic cities in swing states were engaged in “massive fraud,” a CNN KFile review of Whatley’s comments following the election found. Whatley, who has since acknowledged Joe Biden is the country’s legitimate president, currently serves as general counsel at the RNC overseeing litigation and what the organization calls its “election integrity” efforts. His elevation to RNC chair could give Trump a loyalist more willing to devote resources to pursue future voter fraud claims in court should they arise. One reason why Trump soured on Ronna McDaniel, the current chair, was his perception she should have done more to fight for his candidacy in 2020, CNN reported. Like many Republicans, Whatley publicly backed Trump’s voter fraud claims on multiple occasions following the 2020 election. “Regardless of how these lawsuits come out around the country with the presidential race we do know that there was massive fraud that took place,” Whatley said in one late November 2020 interview on local North Carolina radio. “We know that it took place in places like Milwaukee and Detroit and Philadelphia.” There is no evidence of massive fraud in any of those cities or around the country as Republican election officials and Trump-appointed former Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged . Trump and his supporters filed more than 60 cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one. Whatley, a former Senate staffer and one-time lobbyist focused on energy-related issues, said in a statement to CNN he believed pandemic related changes to voting laws weakened safeguards against voter fraud. “There is no question that changes to the 2020 election process which weakened safeguards on absentee and mail-in votes in some states led to distrust by many across the Country. I firmly believe in having proper safeguards in place to ensure that it is easy to vote and hard to cheat.“ Whatley is one of two candidates Trump and his allies are supporting to take over the RNC. The other is Drew McKissick, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. Trump turned on McDaniel over the poor finances and management of the RNC at a time when the organization is facing one of its worst fundraising years in a decade. CNN reported Tuesday that McDaniel is planning to step down at the end of the month. Despite Trump’s preferred picks, only RNC members can choose to elect the new chairman. False claims about the 2020 election In his capacity as chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party in the days following the 2020 election, Whatley parroted much of Trump’s false election claims. One day before the election was called for Biden, Whatley echoed false claims about Republican poll watchers being barred from observation. “There’s also issues [in] surrounding states like Michigan and Pennsylvania where they’re not allowing Republican observers into the polling location to watch the voting,” Whatley said. “When we have instances of voter fraud, then obviously if those are widespread enough to be able to, you know, affect the outcome, you’re gonna have litigation that’s gonna deal with those.” One week following the 2020 election, Whatley called it alarming that the results would be determined in court but said it was the strategy needed for Trump to secure victory. At the time, there were recounts occurring in major swing states – all of which would affirm Biden’s victory. “I think that what we’re seeing in Georgia, especially with the hand recount,” he said on local North Carolina radio . “What we’re seeing in Arizona where we’re gonna have a recount out there as well – And then it’s gonna basically put states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin into court. It really is kind of scary proposition to think that you’re gonna have a court overturn some of those results. But that’s really the plan.” “And I get asked every single day by a reporter, why do you keep alleging that there’s fraud out there?” he continued. “And it’s like, all you have to do is look at the stories that we’re seeing out of Philadelphia, the Detroit area, we’re seeing out of Milwaukee, egregious violations of election law. And there’s no question why it puts these elections at risk.” At the time, Trump and his allies were inundating the public with unfounded allegations of fraud in Democratic cities. They made baseless claims of excluded poll watchers, fake reports of suitcases filled with fraudulent ballots, bogus allegations of bussed-in ballots from New York to swing states and false assertions that Philadelphia had more ballots than voters. Whatley pointed to the contested 2000 presidential election recount in Florida, where he served on the Bush recount team during the legal disputes between George W. Bush and Al Gore, to argue the election was far from over. Ultimately, the Supreme Court intervened and stopped the recount, effectively deciding the election in Bush’s favor. “We’re not done in the presidential. We’re not done at all,” he added, referring to the 2020 election, in the interview. Condemned January 6th - but suggested not done by “Republican voters” In an interview on January 2, 2021, Whatley resigned himself to Biden being President – but said objections to the election were important to discuss the claims of fraud. “I think the fact that we’re likely to have the outcome be that Joe Biden is going to get certified and sworn in, does not mean that these protests are irrelevant,” he said . “It is absolutely critical that we have a national dialogue on election integrity. What we saw in places like Milwaukee and Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Phoenix is really very, very troubling.” Following the riot on January 6, 2021, Whatley condemned those who broke into the Capitol building in interviews. “The actions of these violent protestors is completely unjustified and unacceptable. There is no rationale to excuse this assault on the foundations of our Democracy,” he said in a tweet since deleted. In an interview, Whatley described himself as “appalled” by January 6th riot, but said the Republican Party as “a whole” was not “complicit” in what happened. “Most of the people that have been arrested were not necessarily Republican voters,” Whatley said in February 2021. “There’s certainly Trump supporters in there, but we’ve also seen others and we’re gonna unequivocally condemn those actions. In the aftermath of the January 6th some have sought to deflect blame for the riot by alleging Republican partisans weren’t the primarily force behind it, though subsequent investigations have shown that those arrested were mostly Trump supporters. In another interview in February 2021 , Whatley acknowledged Biden as “legitimately” elected President of the United States. “I was a member of the Electoral College, and I proudly cast my vote for President Trump. But the Electoral college voted. And a majority was for Joe Biden and he is the President of the United.” Following Biden’s inauguration, Whatley attacked the impeachment of former President Trump and in March referred to the Republican Party as “Donald Trump’s party,” at a local event."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — There is a dizzying array of court cases related to former President Donald Trump. Only one is headed to the US Supreme Court this week. It is a Colorado case in which Trump was declared ineligible for the state’s 2024 ballot for violating the Civil War-era insurrection clause in the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution. When we asked CNN readers for their questions about the Supreme Court case, it quickly became clear in the hundreds of responses that a lot of people are struggling to keep all of Trump’s legal issues separate. For instance, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Thursday in the 14th Amendment case – the same week that an appeals court in Washington, DC, clarified that, no, Trump does not enjoy “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution for his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election. For an excellent, shorter version of what might happen at the court this week, listen to this “One Thing” podcast with CNN’s Supreme Court expert Joan Biskupic . In answering readers’ questions below, we’ve tried to delineate between the multiple cases involving Trump. We’ve also edited the wording in some questions for grammar and style. Can Trump be prevented from being on all election ballots in 2024? Dave in Texas The case Supreme Court justices are hearing on Thursday has to do with a finding in Colorado’s court system that Trump engaged in insurrection and a decision by the state Supreme Court that he should be removed from the ballot. The state courts stayed that decision until the US Supreme Court weighs in. What comes next is very much in the hands of the US Supreme Court, and there are many possible outcomes. Will justices affirm or overturn the decision by Colorado’s Supreme Court? Will the US Supreme Court weigh in on whether Trump engaged in insurrection? If justices allow Trump to be excluded from the Colorado ballot, will it endanger his status in other states? There is no requirement that the same names appear on every presidential ballot in the country, and in fact, the ballots vary from state to state. If you are indicted, are you presumed innocent? If a person has not been found guilty, how can they be barred from an election? Peter in Florida Yes, anyone facing criminal prosecution, including Trump, is presumed innocent. But the question currently before the Supreme Court about whether he violated the insurrectionist clause in the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal charges he faces in state and federal courts. In the 14th Amendment case , which was brought by a group of Republican and independent voters in Colorado, a state judge found, after hearing evidence, that Trump “engaged in insurrection.” The Colorado Supreme Court later ruled, by a slim majority, that he was ineligible to be on the state’s ballot. Now the US Supreme Court gets to weigh in. Of course, Trump is facing four different criminal trials – and two of them, in state court in Georgia and federal court in Washington, DC, have to do with his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But he is not currently charged in any court with the specific crime of inciting insurrection or rebellion. Could the Supreme Court endanger other aspects of the 14th Amendment, such as birthright citizenship, if it interpreted the insurrection clause as only relevant to a specific historical period, like the aftermath of the Civil War, thus potentially excluding its application to modern contexts, such as the protection of freedom of speech and the right to protest? James in New York This is a thoughtful question. Trump, for instance, has said that if he is reelected he will work to end birthright citizenship, even though it is guaranteed in the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment also has important clauses having to do with the drawing of congressional districts – a subject on which the Supreme Court frequently gets involved – and the public debt, which has grown exponentially. It is possible that the people who try to influence US policy by maneuvering cases toward the Supreme Court could try to exploit a decision for their own purposes. But it would be the height of irony for conservative justices who claim to be “originalist” interpreters of the Constitution, particularly in terms of the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms, to stray from originalism in the case of the 14th Amendment. Can Trump actually be convicted of a felony and still be elected as our president? One cannot be in the military if convicted of a felony, so how could this be possible? Robin in New York We get this question a lot. The answer is yes. There is nothing in the Constitution about a convict being unqualified to serve. There are only three requirements. A candidate must be: A natural born citizen. At least 35 years old. A resident of the US for at least 14 years. It is an important thing for voters to be able to choose from the candidates they desire and for the system to protect against frivolous criminal prosecutions aimed at disqualifying political opponents. The efforts to try Trump in criminal court, which have dragged on for years, have been anything but frivolous. But again, the Supreme Court this week is not considering anything to do with Trump’s criminal prosecutions. This case is specifically focused on the finding that he engaged in insurrection and his ability to appear on the ballot in Colorado. Do you really believe the Supreme Court will rule against Trump? Really you should remember who appointed them. They have lost my trust in the judicial system. Gerald It is true that Trump appointed three of the nine Supreme Court’s associate justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. It is also true that this Supreme Court did not intervene to help him keep the White House in 2020. Without any public dissents, they rejected his bid to block millions of votes for Joe Biden in battleground states. What are the chances that Trump is banned from the ballot and jailed for his part in the insurrection? Becky in Ohio These are separate questions. Trump’s ballot eligibility in Colorado is before the nine Supreme Court justices. While he has not been charged in criminal court specifically with the crime of insurrection, he does face four separate criminal trials, two of which are focused on his 2020 election interference. In those cases, which will be decided by juries of Trump’s peers, he could theoretically face jail time if convicted. What recourse does the American citizen have when SCOTUS rules against the meaning of law? Or, cowardly punts the decision to the states or Congress? Rebecca Vote. Supreme Court justices are appointed by presidents and confirmed by senators. If you don’t like the makeup of the court, the only current way to change it is to vote for lawmakers you agree with and then wait for them to act. That’s an unsatisfying answer since justices can sit on the bench for decades. There are efforts to change the court to spark more frequent turnover, but they currently lack momentum. To the second part of this question, the court can essentially make law with its decisions, so they are reinterpreting rather than ruling against it. To that point, if, as a voter, you’d rather have more input on laws, it is a feature and not a flaw when the court punts decisions back to lawmakers. Trump lawyers say because the 14th Amendment doesn’t specifically say ‘president’ that it doesn’t pertain to Trump. It does say that anyone holding office that has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution cannot hold office if they participate in insurrection. The presidency is the highest office in the USA. This has to make him accountable. Am l correct? Eldon This is the question on which the entire 14th Amendment case may hinge. The original Colorado judge who ruled Trump did engage in insurrection did not remove Trump from the ballot. She was convinced by his lawyers’ argument that the presidency is not covered by the insurrection clause because it does not specifically list the president as an “officer” of the US. The Colorado Supreme Court took the opposite view. Read its opinion , which examines, in great detail, all of the arguments about whether the president is an officer of the US government and concludes that obviously he or she is. It’s not exactly pertinent to this case, but an appeals court that determined Trump is not immune from prosecution notably referred to the president as an “officer.” Here’s exactly what the 14th Amendment says : No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. If those who make policy and laws are voted into office – such as members of Congress – why don’t Supreme Court justices have to get elected? Their jobs are far more important in the grand scheme since they can just rule a law the other party (and people) voted for as unconstitutional. Matthew in Washington It’s a wonky system. Supreme Court justices are supposed to be insulated from politics and independent from the two elected branches of government. This independence, according to Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, was important to guard the Constitution and individual rights from “ ill humors ” of the public. In reality, most Supreme Court justices come from very political backgrounds, and they are appointed by presidents who hope they will sway to a political side. Their power is supposed to be balanced by the other two branches; they are appointed by the executive, and the legislative branch sets the makeup of the courts and can, if needed, remove judges from office. If the Supreme Court decides to weigh in on the presidential immunity issue, and he wins the election before they make their decision, what could happen? Cheryl-Anne This is a separate question than the 14th Amendment ballot issue the Supreme Court is considering this week. The court specifically declined to take up the question of Trump’s immunity from criminal prosecution so that an appeals court in Washington, DC, could hear that case. That three-judge appeals court panel decided this week that Trump is not immune from prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election. The Supreme Court could now decide to also consider the immunity question, but it’s not at all clear that it will. It’s also not clear what might happen if Trump is convicted and then elected. He could try to pardon himself, despite the obvious moral hazard of doing so. If he’s elected before a conviction, he could try to get the Department of Justice to drop the case. It would be unprecedented territory. Should Clarence Thomas recuse himself in the Trump case because of his wife’s actions? Linda in Virginia For reference, Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a conservative activist and was involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. She has testified she did not discuss the election with her husband. Whether or not her activism means Clarence Thomas should recuse himself from election-related cases is up for debate. There are no hard rules related to Supreme Court justices recusing themselves from cases. What is abundantly clear is that Clarence Thomas probably won’t be recusing himself from Trump-related matters. Why has no one stated that judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, should be removed from overseeing a court involving Trump? She has made judgments in favor of Trump’s defense on motions that the prosecution has not even filed for the court to review. Judge Cannon is violating her oath to be unbiased and impartial while acting as a sitting judge. Keith This question pertains to one of the four criminal cases – the one being prosecuted in federal court in Florida and in which the government says Trump mishandled classified data and conspired to cover it up. It is true that Cannon was appointed by Trump, but so was one-third of the US Supreme Court. Judges appointed by both Barack Obama and Biden have also heard matters related to Trump and election interference. That’s the way the judicial system works. If the timing is such that Trump gets elected and then is later convicted of federal crimes, what happens? Can Congress take impeachment action on that? What is involved? Or is he untouchable as chief exec? Worse, can he be actual president while in prison? Can he be placed in prison by a court after being elected president? Biff The general thinking is that Trump would find a way to throw out federal prosecutions if they are not concluded before he takes office, assuming he is reelected. The Department of Justice has a long-standing custom of not taking legal action against a sitting president. But that policy does not apply to state courts, and he is facing two criminal prosecutions in state courts in Georgia and New York. Congress could always move to impeach him, but that would only be a realistic possibility if Democrats took control of the House. I’m trying to imagine an election in which Trump won the White House and Democrats won the House. It’s not impossible! But maybe unlikely. Plus, any majority on Capitol Hill is likely to be small, and multiple Republican votes would be required to convict him in the Senate, which at the moment also seems unlikely. We would be deep into uncharted territory if Trump was to be convicted and then win reelection. Nobody really knows what would be involved. If the US Supreme Court decides he can be excluded from ballots, could enough people ‘write his name in?’ How will those votes actually be counted in districts, and more importantly, will those votes actually supersede the fact that he isn’t actually on the ballot and count? Grady in North Carolina Trump’s name is already printed on primary ballots in Colorado. If the Supreme Court rules he can be kept off the ballot before the primary on March 5, the state Secretary of State has said that votes for him would not count. As for write-ins, the case is ultimately about his eligibility to serve as president. If the court rules he’s ineligible, write-ins probably would not matter. But that would have to be determined. Why isn’t Trump’s trial being televised? Or the upcoming Supreme Court hearing? The people need to see what is really happening – the good and the bad. Ilda in Texas Federal courts do not allow television cameras, which I’ve argued is a mistake . That said, there will be live audio of the Supreme Court oral arguments Thursday. That’s a step in the right direction. Is there the possibility the Supreme Court narrowly decides that states cannot dictate who a party chooses as its candidate based on freedom of speech and assembly and not make a decision on whether a state can remove a candidate from the general election ballot? Jeffrey Anything is possible for the Supreme Court. Justices frequently find creative ways to decide the outcome of cases without deciding core issues in them. See Bush v. Gore, which decided the 2000 presidential election by stopping a recount in Florida. The scenario you describe would, I believe, allow Trump to be on the ballot while sidestepping the issue of whether he engaged in insurrection. That would not be shocking. If Trump is unable to run for president for ANY reason, who will the Republicans back as their candidate? Bill in Virginia We don’t know for sure, but timing is everything. Primaries season is underway and Trump is the clear choice of most Republicans so far (as is Biden on the Democratic side). If Trump or Biden were to leave the race early enough, perhaps an alternate would be able to win enough delegates to capture the nomination. Given her break with Trump, it seems unlikely that most Republicans would want to choose former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. If there’s no candidate who has won a majority of the delegates after the primaries, the delegates themselves would ultimately pick alternative candidates at the party conventions this summer. That would be a fascinating and messy process to witness. If a vacancy occurred after the nominating conventions, both parties have processes to pick alternates. If, as he claims, Trump won the 2020 election, why doesn’t the 22nd Amendment keep him from running now? James in North Carolina I think you’ve identified a main problem with his continued lies about the 2020 election. The 22nd Amendment makes clear that a person can only be elected twice to the presidency. Despite what he says, however, he was not elected in 2020 and he’s not president now, so the 22nd Amendment should not apply to him."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/haley-voters-trump-gop-biden-analysis/index.html,"CNN — As the South Carolina Republican primary approaches, the evidence is growing that Nikki Haley’s coalition is almost certainly not large enough to deny Donald Trump the GOP presidential nomination. But evidence is also accumulating that her coalition is more than large enough to deny Trump the White House in a general election if her voters remain as alienated from him as they now say they are. Story highlights Haley is exposing fault lines in the GOP coalition Her coalition doesn't appear to be enough to stop Trump from winning the nomination But her supporters present an opportunity for Biden to peel off crossover voters in a possible rematch with Trump The support for Haley in the early GOP contests has mapped, probably more precisely than ever before, the segments of the Republican electorate most deeply disaffected with Trump. In a possible rematch with Trump this fall, President Joe Biden will likely need to attract crossover support from a significant share of those ordinarily Republican-leaning voters to overcome the towering discontent evident in polls about his own performance. So far, most polls show Biden making only very limited inroads in a general election against Trump with the kind of GOP primary voters displaying the most support for Haley – a universe centered on college-educated, ideologically centrist, and Republican-leaning independent voters. But surveys of voters participating in the Iowa and New Hampshire nominating contests show that most Haley supporters express deeply negative views about Trump. That could provide Biden an opening for greater gains in the months ahead – if he can resolve, or even temper, more of those voters’ doubts about his own record, age and strength. “If there’s anything that should be sending warning flares up in the sky for the Trump people, this is it,” said Ace Smith, a California-based Democratic strategist, referring to the large number of Haley voters expressing negative views of the former president in polls. Long-time GOP strategist Michael Madrid, who advised the anti-Trump Lincoln Project in 2020, said the evidence of the early Republican results, and polls of GOP voters nationwide about the Trump-Haley contest, are sending the party a clear, but dual, message. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, in December 2023. Carlos Barria/Reuters/File Related article CNN Poll: Most Americans want verdict on Trump election subversion charges before 2024 vote On the one hand, Madrid said, all of these signals show “there’s not a lane for anyone else to get the nomination: This is Trump’s party.” But the same evidence, Madrid said, shows “Trump is entering this race significantly weaker with the Republican base than at any time since he secured the nomination in 2016.” The first stages of the battle for the 2024 GOP nomination have largely confirmed the party’s divided attitudes about Trump, which have been seen in national surveys over the past several years. Depending on the question, somewhere between one-fifth and one-third of self-identified GOP partisans have consistently expressed negative views in polls about Trump, particularly regarding his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection and his broader effort to overturn the 2020 election result. For instance, in a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland national survey , between 19% to 23% of Republicans and independents who lean toward the party agreed that Trump bore significant responsibility for the January 6 riot; that Trump “threatened democracy” when he told his supporters to march on the Capitol that day; that he was likely guilty of the criminal charges against him for attempting to overturn the 2020 election; and that the January 6 assault “was an attack on democracy that should never be forgotten.” Likewise, in a recent CBS poll released on the third anniversary of January 6 , about one-fourth of Republicans said they would describe the attack on the Capitol as an insurrection and an attempt to overthrow the US government. Roughly 3-in-10 Republicans said Biden had legitimately won the 2020 election and about one-third opposed pardons for the January 6 rioters, which Trump has signaled he will offer if elected to another term. More broadly, in the latest CNN national poll conducted by SSRS , just under one-fourth of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents said they viewed Trump unfavorably. Almost exactly the same share said the party would have a better chance to win in November with a nominee other than Trump . In a national NBC News poll released Sunday , 22% of GOP primary voters agreed that “the Republican Party needs a new leader with better personal behavior and a different approach” than Trump, while another 14% said “Donald Trump was a good president, but it is time to consider other leaders.” Across all of these questions, the share of Republican-leaning voters expressing negative views about Trump does not nearly approach a majority of the party. That explains why Haley faces such a steep uphill climb against him for the nomination, even though she has finally achieved the one-on-one race against Trump that his Republican critics have sought since 2016. Yet through Iowa and New Hampshire, despite not winning those contests, the former South Carolina governor has demonstrated that the minority of the party that has long expressed anti-Trump views in polls can be mobilized into a coherent coalition of resistance to him at the ballot box. And at a time when the nation is divided so closely between Republicans and Democrats, defection from even such a minority faction in his own camp could be difficult for Trump to overcome in a general election should he advance that far. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump AP, Getty Images Related article CNN Poll: Trump narrowly leads Biden in general election rematch Even if only about 1-in-10 ordinarily Republican voters “would defect if Trump is the nominee, that’s potentially significant in a close election,” said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist . In Iowa, the voters resisting Trump split between Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has since dropped out; in New Hampshire they consolidated around Haley as the sole remaining alternative. But in each case, the GOP voters rejecting Trump have displayed similar demographic and ideological characteristics, according to the entrance and exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. In each state, Trump showed significantly less strength among voters with a college degree than those without one and much less strength among independents who voted than partisan Republicans. He also lagged among voters who identify as somewhat conservative or moderate compared to those who called themselves “very conservative” and did not run as well among those who do not identify as evangelical Christians as those who do. “This is not a casual vote, it’s a really thought-out vote,” said Celinda Lake, a long-time Democratic pollster who advised Biden’s 2020 campaign. “It has a whole schema around it – views about policy, views about temperament, about the criminal cases. It’s a very integrated view [about Trump].” In the two kick-off contests, Haley voters in particular expressed strikingly negative views about Trump and his assertions about the 2020 election. In the entrance poll conducted of GOP caucusgoers in Iowa, almost exactly 4-in-5 Haley voters said Trump would not be fit to serve as president again if convicted of a crime, according to results provided by CNN’s polling unit; likewise 4-in-5 Haley Iowa voters said Biden had legitimately won the 2020 election. In New Hampshire, more than 4-in-5 Haley voters said Trump would not be fit to serve again if convicted and that Biden had legitimately won. Fully 85% of Haley supporters said they would be dissatisfied if Trump were the nominee. The AP/NORC VoteCast poll offered similar warning signs for Trump. In that poll, two-thirds of Haley voters in Iowa said they would not vote for Trump in a general election; that number soared past three-fourths of her voters in New Hampshire. The Washington Post/Monmouth University poll of GOP voters in South Carolina released last week showed Trump opening a resounding 26 percentage point lead over Haley in her home state, which will hold its critical GOP primary on February 24. Yet the survey also raised the same general election red flags for Trump as the Edison surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire. In this September 2020 photo, Donald Trump speaks during the first presidential debate against Joe Biden at the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Morry Gash/Pool/Getty Images/File Related article A Biden-Trump rematch would be mostly about Trump In the South Carolina poll, roughly three-fourths of those voting for Haley said they viewed Trump unfavorably; over three-fourths said Biden legitimately won in 2020; nearly three-fifths said Trump committed a crime in his response to that result; and less than one-in-five said they planned to vote for Trump in November. Smith said that the resistance to Trump surfacing in these early GOP primary polls will be “a huge, huge problem” for him in the general election. Two factors largely explain it, he believes: hostility to Trump’s role in overturning the nationwide legal right to abortion, which the US Supreme Court did in 2022, “plus people just not wanting the craziness and the chaos.” Madrid said the cumulative evidence from the early election results and these surveys indicates that the component of the GOP coalition dubious of Trump is larger than most people have thought – and likely larger than at any point since he first emerged as the party’s nominee in 2016. The Republicans critical of Trump were so isolated that “we used to be on one group chat and now we are running out of muskets to hand out to be in the conflict,” Madrid said. “I think everybody you talk to will all say the same thing: something has shifted. [Haley] is becoming the rallying cry for something different and something bigger, and that tells me that the swamp fever has broken with a wide part of the Republican Party.” Madrid estimates that the share of ordinarily Republican-leaning voters fundamentally disaffected with Trump has grown from around 6%-8% in 2020 to as much as nearly 20% now. Still, experts in both parties agree that many of the Haley primary voters now saying they would not support Trump in November would eventually fall into line behind him if he becomes the nominee. Haley herself, of course, has said that if she loses the nomination she would vote for Trump over Biden “any day of the week.” Jennifer Horn, a former New Hampshire Republican party chair who has become a fierce Trump critic, said, “I don’t think that whole 30%” or so of GOP voters coalescing behind Haley in the early states “goes to Biden because amongst that 30% are folks that are very loyal Republicans. They might not be loyal MAGA … but we know there are people out there who simply won’t vote for a Democrat.” The key “question for Biden,” she added, “is how many of the others can he win over?” Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump’s 2024 campaign, said that Trump would suffer minimal defections in the GOP coalition in a rematch with Biden because Republican voters believe Trump’s presidency produced far better results on the issues they care about than the current administration. “As long as they think Joe Biden is a really bad president, [Trump] will still keep those” voters now flocking to Haley, McLaughlin said. “They will be voting their self-interest. They are voting their pocketbooks, the border, crime and safety. They are voting war and peace. We always say the presidential race is decided by the two p’s: peace and prosperity. And on those ‘two p’s’ they look at Donald Trump and say, he did a better job.” The CNN national poll released last week suggests that many of the Republicans skeptical of Trump are indeed making that calculation. In a hypothetical matchup against the former president, the survey found Biden winning just 6% of GOP partisans and independents who leaned toward the party – far fewer than the 23% of those voters who expressed an unfavorable view of Trump. One key reason: fully 93% of all GOP-leaning voters said they disapproved of Biden’s performance as president. Similarly, in the new national NBC poll, just 8% of all GOP primary voters said they plan to vote for Biden in the general election – far fewer than the more than one-third in the survey who said they wanted the party to move beyond Trump. “I just don’t think there’s some significant possibility of [the] people telling AP VoteCast or the Exit Poll they are Republican not voting for Trump,” despite what they say now, veteran GOP pollster Bill McInturff – whose firm conducts the NBC survey with a Democratic partner – said in an email. Lake agrees the Republican disaffection surfacing in the primaries is so far translating more into hesitance about Trump than support for Biden. But she sees opportunities for Biden to flip more of those conflicted voters in the months ahead. Trump’s vehement personal attacks on Haley – as well as his vituperative comments about E. Jean Carroll and his supporters’ fervid denunciations of Taylor Swift ­– will alienate more GOP-leaning women, Lake believes. And the fact that so many independents have made the effort to participate in a Republican primary to vote against Trump, she said, shows they remain within reach for Biden, even if they are down on his performance now. In addition, Lake noted, the Haley coalition revolves heavily around college-educated voters who are the most likely to express growing optimism about the economy, particularly with the stock market surging. Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster who advised the super PAC supporting DeSantis during his presidential run, takes a position somewhere in between McInturff and Lake. Wilson believes many of the voters flocking to Haley are lost to a Trump-led GOP, but that Trump can win a general election without them. He can offset any defections, Wilson wrote in an email, “by winning votes from groups that would have voted for Democrats prior to the last few elections.” “We can see in some of the recent national polls what his 2024 path to victory might look like,” Wilson added, “and it’s through the White and Hispanic working class rather than by winning over all the Haley voters.” Madrid counters that the primary results so far show Trump faces the risk that his losses among upscale voters compared to 2020 will exceed his gains in blue-collar and non-White communities. Madrid believes Biden’s record on immigration is the biggest obstacle to him harvesting support among the Republicans uneasy about Trump. Discontent over illegal immigration, Madrid argues, is the most powerful weapon Trump will have in a general election to win back Republican-leaning women who both dislike his behavior and support abortion rights. For Biden, who has endorsed a tough bipartisan Senate immigration bill, “the best way he can guarantee his reelection is to crash hard into the center on that issue, and go hard on the border,” Madrid said. Lake doesn’t agree that any single issue is critical for Biden with the kind of GOP voters who have rallied to Haley. Instead, she believes the GOP primaries are again showing that Trump’s biggest weakness are doubts about his character, demeanor and priorities. “We know that they [the Republicans resistant to Trump] are worried about how strong and effective Biden can be,” Lake said. “But the reality is their vote is going to be about Trump; it’s not going to be about Biden. Biden has to be the mirror to show you what Trump really is. Where Trump is chaos, he is steady. Where Trump is about revenge, he is about solutions.” The widespread dissatisfaction with Biden’s performance has generated ominous splits in the Democratic coalition, particularly among younger voters and minority men. Finding ways to exploit the divisions in the GOP coalition that Haley has exposed may be Biden’s best hope of overcoming the cracks in his own electoral foundation."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/doj-guidelines-journalists-records/index.html,"CNN — The Justice Department released new guidance Wednesday to assist federal investigators abide by department rules when attempting to access journalists’ records. The department bars employees from secretly seeking reporters’ records except in limited circumstances. Attorney General Merrick Garland codified those rules after it was revealed that the Justice Department during the Trump administration had seized records from reporters at various news organizations, including CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times. Under department rules, prosecutors are only allowed to subpoena journalists’ records in certain circumstances, including if the information they are seeking is imperative to prevent a serious crime, if the journalist themselves are the target of an investigation, if the records involve already public information or if the journalist agrees to the disclosure of their records. The guidance released Wednesday is intended to help DOJ personnel understand whether they can seek journalists records, and how they can abide by the rules if they plan to subpoena those records. “This Policy is not intended to extend special protections to members of the news media who are subjects or targets of a criminal investigation, or are parties to a civil investigation, for conduct outside the scope of newsgathering,” the guidance, posted on the department website , states. The guidance tells prosecutors to evaluate whether someone is a reporter by looking at “the frequency of the person’s or entity’s reporting and whether the person or entity brings information to the attention of the public, engages in newsgathering, has independent sources, holds press credentials, is employed by a member of the news media, and/or is widely identified as a journalist or reporter.” “The Department does not consider the ideology or viewpoint of a person or entity, or of its reporting, when determining whether that person or entity qualifies as a member of the news media for purposes of this Policy,” the guidance states. Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, praised the guidance in a statement to CNN. ﻿“The new guidance shows the commitment of DOJ leadership to further anchor within the Department the historic policy changes it put in place in 2022,” Brown said. “Those new rules better protect the watchdog role of the press and the Justice Manual provisions provide the daily details to help prosecutors carry out this objective.” This story has been updated with additional reaction."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/white-house-hur-investigation-biden/index.html,"CNN — Allies of President Joe Biden are pointing fingers at his legal and communications teams for missteps they say aggravated the political damage of special counsel Robert Hur’s findings in his classified documents investigation. Some leading Democratic politicians expressed their frustration directly to high-level administration officials in the wake of the report, insisting that the overall response to the probe had been too muted and that the release of the response was completely bungled politically. Hur declined to bring criminal charges against Biden and said the facts stopped short of finding he willfully retained classified material. But in doing so, Hur offered a deeply damaging portrait of an aging president beset by memory issues, who had trouble recalling dates and details during his five-hour interview with the special counsel. White House and Biden allies have taken aim at Hur for what they view as a gratuitous characterization of the president. But some Democrats and supporters of the president have questioned the decision to sit for a five-hour interview over two days last October amid a spiraling Middle East crisis. They’re also putting scrutiny on the decision to allow the interview to be recorded and for the communications strategy that they believe has added to the president’s reelection woes. A source close to the Biden legal team pushed back at the criticism of their strategy, saying, “After a hostile prosecutor investigated the president for 15 months trying to find something to charge, the Biden legal team strategy ended with zero indictments and total exoneration. That is an unequivocal win.” From the beginning of the documents matter, in November 2022 when classified documents turned up at a former office space Biden used between his vice-presidential tenure and his White House term, the president’s strategy focused on cooperating with the National Archives and FBI. The strategy was as much legal as it was political: Biden’s aides hoped to draw a contrast with Donald Trump, whose alleged obstruction in his own classified documents investigation led to criminal charges. Indeed, Hur compared Biden’s cooperation favorably to Trump’s in his report. The president and the White House faced an additional incentive to cooperate. If they didn’t, the Justice Department was prepared to seek subpoenas to compel searches to retrieve documents, CNN has previously reported. Hur’s report, which concluded with no charges, would suggest that the strategy worked — except for the multiple instances in the report questioning Biden’s memory, including the line that listed among the reasons to not bring charges: “Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview with him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” Some close to Biden have questioned whether he received sound legal advice during the high-stakes investigation, a source told CNN, raising specific concerns about why lawyers allowed Biden to be interviewed in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7. White House Counsel Ed Siskel and Robert Bauer, the president’s personal attorney, were in the White House Map Room for the president’s interview with Hur, people briefed on the matter said. The interview took place after weeks of negotiations, a standard part of such investigations. Unlike Trump, whose lawyers refused to allow an in-person interview and instead submitted written answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller’s team in the Russian election interference investigation, Biden’s lawyers never contemplated such a move. The strategy of drawing a contrast with Trump, officials say, made sitting for an in-person interview a no-brainer. Surprise over the handling of Biden’s interview with Hur Several former Justice Department and White House lawyers who are experienced in dealing with situations where a president or vice president is being interviewed stressed the importance that lawyers negotiating with the special counsel have extensive criminal and trial experience. While the sources gave credit to Biden’s team for early cooperation with the National Archives and the FBI when classified documents were first found in Biden’s office and home, they stressed that special counsels often dig for an extensive level of detail, including through an interview process, to produce a final public report. Recognizing those factors would be critical when negotiating interview parameters, including whether it was recorded. “Sometimes you want a recording, and it helps you…for nuance and clarity,” one of the sources said. “But with a president or vice president, you would negotiate that because you know it is going to become part of the public record sooner or later.” “This could have easily been negotiated,” the source continued, voicing surprise at both the timing of the interview and the length of the sessions, which were spread out over two days on October 8 and 9. A White House official previously told CNN that Biden had been “understandably distracted” the weekend of the Hur interview, given that a war was breaking out in Israel. The interview with Hur had been scheduled well before the attacks in Israel, which consumed much of Biden’s time in the lead-up to the event. He spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an hour or so before the interview occurred. While there was some initial discussion of postponing the interview, Biden and his lawyers ultimately decided against it because they hoped it would help expedite Hur’s investigation. It also wasn’t clear when the next opportunity would be to block off large chucks of time on Biden’s schedule, particularly with a budding war in the Middle East. Officials also said Biden determined an interview would demonstrate he was being transparent with the special counsel and provide a contrast with Trump’s attempts to impede the investigation into his own handling of classified documents. One Democratic ally close to the White House said they couldn’t fault the president’s legal team for consenting to a recorded interview with the special counsel given the politically charged nature of the probe. They also wouldn’t second guess the decision to go ahead with the interview the weekend of October 8. “You can second guess it now, but at the time it clearly felt like the right thing to do to get it over with,” they said. “That’s a tougher call looking in hindsight.” Questions over decision to have Biden face the press The public-facing response in the immediate aftermath of the report’s release has also invited criticism. The choice for Biden to make remarks and take questions from reporters afterward – just hours after the Hur report came out – has been polarizing. While the president seized the opportunity to forcefully reject some of the claims in the report, including the fact that he allegedly couldn’t remember when his late son, Beau, had died, the impromptu news conference after the speech invited numerous questions about his mental acuity and age. Biden flashed deep irritation as he fielded those questions, and the president was undoubtedly on defense. It was a mistake for the White House to “put him out on weakness and not strength,” one administration official said. Others disagree. “I do think showing some fire in the belly was not a bad thing and for people to see,” said a former senior White House official. “I do think they had to show some urgency on Thursday night.” Some Biden allies also believed the optics of Biden’s statement – standing in front of a wall of shouting reporters, at moments appearing uncertain – could have been better managed, particularly at such a highly sensitive moment. The White House said Tuesday it was Biden’s own choice to appear Thursday evening from the Diplomatic Reception Room. “It was the president’s idea. It was his idea,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “You saw the president do this, make a statement and take questions from all of you, because he wanted to do it,” she said. As Biden was speaking from the podium, some of his senior-most aides – including communications adviser Anita Dunn, message guru Mike Donilon and chief of staff Jeff Zients – listened from the back of the room. Frustration with lack of coordinated response Some White House officials and Democrats close to the White House, including some former administration officials, were left wondering why there didn’t appear to be a clearer and more forceful pushback against Hur’s report the moment it was made public. When news of the report first broke, some White House officials felt frustrated about not having been armed with clear talking points, multiple sources said. The grave sensitivities surrounding the special counsel investigation naturally meant that only a very small group of Biden advisers were in the know about the details of the lengthy report – but that left some of those who were in the dark feeling discouraged. “It was clear from the outset that they were scrambling to land on a message,” said one former official, who wondered out loud whether it would have helped for more White House officials to have been in the loop to help prepare a more fulsome response. One person briefed on the matter pushed back against the suggestion that more staffers should have been briefed ahead of time. “The special counsel forced the attorneys who reviewed the report in advance not to share information about the contents with anyone else,” they said. White House officials stood by the forcefulness of the White House’s pushback to Hur’s report, saying not only did Biden take questions from reporters Thursday night, but the next day, White House counsel spokesman Ian Sams joined the press briefing. The White House has also sent a letter to the White House Correspondents’ Association taking issue with news coverage of the Hur report, the officials pointed out, while the Biden campaign has pointed to allies and legal experts questioning aspects of the report that the White House sees as problematic. Still, some Biden allies have questioned why the White House declined to have the president sit down with CBS News for a pre-Super Bowl interview – a unique opportunity to send a clear message to more than 100 million Americans tuning in over the weekend on the heels of the special counsel report. The White House said it didn’t want to interrupt a non-political event with a presidential interview and that the president would find “many other ways” to communicate with Americans. In fact on Sunday, the Biden campaign joined TikTok for the first time and posted a video. CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/mitch-mcconnell-foreign-aid/index.html,"Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell strongly defended his handling of a foreign aid package and bipartisan border security deal that have come under heavy criticism from his right flank, saying bluntly that “every argument” against Ukraine aid is “wrong” and that the opposition amounts to a “political reaction” driven by former President Donald Trump . McConnell, having just presided over one of the most tumultuous periods in his nearly two-decade tenure atop the Senate GOP, said he has occasionally in the past been “on the short side” of GOP senators – like on government funding bills and debt ceiling hikes. But in an interview with CNN in his Senate office on Wednesday, McConnell called this battle over Ukraine aid a “rare issue” where he had to get well out front of his party, which has grown increasingly resistant to helping fund the foreign war amid the ascendant isolationist wing being driven by Trump. “It’s not a question of whether I’m frustrated or not,” McConnell said when asked about the criticism he’s endured from within his own party. “I feel strongly this is in our best interest, America’s best interest and the world’s best interests to do this. … And being beat up is something I’m kind of used to after 18 years.” Over the last few weeks, McConnell blessed a bipartisan border security deal that he tried to sell to GOP senators – only to see it derailed by House Republican leaders, fellow senators and Trump himself. Then, he helped push through the Senate a $95.3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan – only to find himself in the minority of his conference when 22 of the 49 GOP senators voted to approve the plan earlier this week. Now, House Speaker Mike Johnson is threatening to shelve the bill altogether – all with Trump’s backing. The US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024. Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article How each member of the Senate voted on foreign aid package In the interview, McConnell harkened back to his childhood when his father – a foot soldier in World War II – had warned about the Russian threat, something he says has only grown more pervasive decades later. “Every argument against this is wrong. Every single one of them,” McConnell said of providing billions more to Ukraine. “Most of the money’s being spent here. Europeans have done as much, and, after the $55 billion from the EU, more than we have. Not a single American soldier has lost their lives in this fight – we’ve got a bunch of people willing to kill Russians. I can’t find any argument against this that makes any sense.” McConnell added: “So I think it’s a political reaction led, obviously, by the likely nominee for president having a view and expressing a view on this. So I think that’s why we are where we are.” Senate GOP leader’s suggestion: A House vote on aid bill McConnell’s comments come as Johnson said on Wednesday that the House would not take up the aid package, with many in his party arguing it’s time to stop pouring money into Ukraine and calling for more aggressive border security measures than the package proposed by the bipartisan group of senators and blessed by the Senate GOP leader. “The Republican-led House will not be jammed or forced into passing a foreign aid bill that was opposed by most Republican senators and does nothing to secure own border,” Johnson said Wednesday. McConnell said he wouldn’t comment on Johnson’s assertion. But he suggested that the Senate bill should get a vote on the House floor. “Whatever advice I have for the speaker I give him privately, not publicly,” McConnell said. “The only thing I’ve said publicly is we’ve heard all kinds of rumors about what the vote would be on Ukraine. Why not have it?” In the interview, McConnell downplayed the influence of the isolationist wing of his party, arguing that Republican views about the US posture in the world have long been driven by their party’s presidential candidate – something not unusual now given Trump’s positions. “Having lived as long as I have, I’ve kind of observed the party go up-and-down on foreign involvements, depending usually on who the president is, or the nominee for president, having the biggest impact on public opinion,” McConnell said. McConnell, who turns 82 next week, has not said if he would run for the GOP leadership spot after his current term concludes at the end of the year. That position could grow more complicated for the Kentucky Republican if Trump wins the presidency, given the two haven’t spoken in more than three years and they had a major falling out after the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack. McConnell non-committal on Mayorkas trial and touts Senate border deal Adding to the challenges of governing under Trump: The former president has tried to scuttle the remaining big-ticket items that McConnell has tried to approve, including on border security. Meantime, the House GOP has aligned itself closely with Trump and taken steps that have made some Republican senators uneasy – including impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the problems at the border. McConnell said he hadn’t taken a position yet on the Mayorkas trial and whether he would vote to dismiss the charges. “I haven’t really thought about it,” McConnell said, noting that Democrats would move to quickly kill the proceedings. “So I don’t think we’ll have two endless trials like we’ve had recently.” In the interview, McConnell defended his handling of the push to get a border deal, noting that Republicans had demanded one before green-lighting more Ukraine aid. And he continued to tout the border deal even though it has been heavily criticized by many in his party and ultimately collapsed. “So I picked (Oklahoma GOP Sen.) James Lankford, who’s really smart, and, as you know, they worked on it for months, came up with a product supported by the border council, the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the Washington Post editorial page,” McConnell said, calling the plan “clearly an improvement over existing law.” After Republicans said they wouldn’t support the border deal, McConnell said he “felt strongly” to move on the rest of the aid package without the immigration measures given the situation in Ukraine. Democrats have seized on the GOP decision to scuttle the border deal – something Democrat Tom Suozzi used i n his successful run in the New York special election for a US House seat on Tuesday night. But McConnell didn’t think the flap would have much of an impact on Senate races . “ I think that every one of these races will hash that out one way or another,” McConnell said. “Obviously up in New York, the Democrat did a better job of dealing with it than the Republican, and I think that’ll play out depending upon the quality of the candidates.” And he pivoted to the Senate GOP push to take back the majority: “I think we’re not going to have a candidate quality problem this cycle on our side .” On the border, McConnell added: “ I think President Biden has a real problem on this issue with or without a new law.” But unlike his House GOP counterparts, McConnell did not take aim at Biden’s memory or mental acuity after concerns were raised by Special Counsel Robert Hur’s damning report last week about his handling of classified records. “The age issue is obviously front and center for both candidates,” McConnell said when asked about the matter. “And I think they’re going to argue about it.” CNN’s Clare Foran and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report."

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/ice-draft-plan-release-migrants/index.html,"Washington CNN — Immigration and Customs Enforcement has drafted contingency plans to cut detention capacity and release thousands of immigrants as a result, according to a source familiar with the plan. The draft plan comes as ICE faces a dire budget shortfall amid stalled congressional action on the White House supplemental request. The Department of Homeland Security has grappled with record levels of migrants at the US-Mexico border over the last year, draining federal resources and funds and prompting a White House ask for $14 billion in border security funding as part of a broader national security request. The supplemental provided $7.6 billion for ICE. President Joe Biden has repeatedly implored Congress to give him more resources to deal with the situation at the US-Mexico border, assigning blame on Republicans for not doing more. “Giving up on real solutions right when they are needed most in order to play politics is not what the American people expect from their leaders. Congress needs to act to give me, Secretary Mayorkas, and my administration the tools and resources needed to address the situation at the border,” Biden said in a statement Tuesday, blasting the House GOP for impeaching Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. ICE – the immigration enforcement arm under DHS – has historically been underfunded and is now staring down a $700 million deficit, according to the source, resulting in discussions that include slashing detention space. Detention facilities and deportation flights are among the priciest budget items for ICE. The Washington Post first reported the draft plans. “The Administration has repeatedly requested additional resources for DHS’s vital missions on the southwest border and Congress has chronically underfunded them,” a Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement. “Without adequate funding for CBP, ICE, and USCIS, the Department will have to reprogram or pull resources from other efforts,” the spokesperson said, adding that ICE won’t be able to sustain its current operational tempo. Over recent years, ICE has assisted Customs and Border Protection in its border mission as that agency is also overwhelmed. In the past, when facing budget shortfalls, ICE has had to move money around within the agency, ask for reprogramming or rely on supplemental funds. Those funds often come from non-immigration related agencies, including Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, among others. The agency detains immigrants with criminal backgrounds, those preparing for removal and those who fall under mandatory detention. Border arrests dropped by 50% in January compared to December, according to newly released federal data. Homeland Security officials have attributed the decline to ongoing high-level talks between the US and Mexico, which has doubled down on enforcement, but caution that encounters historically drop in January before ticking up again. CBP Commissioner Troy Miller conceded authorities still face hurdles on the border, saying in a statement: “We continue to experience serious challenges along our border which surpass the capacity of the immigration system.” In January, the US Border Patrol reported 124,220 encounters along the US-Mexico border. Notably, there was a significant drop in Venezuelans – nearly 11,600 compared to 57,851 in December. Both the US and Mexico have restarted deportation flights to Venezuela. Without additional funding, CBP may also need to repurpose funds and draw back some operations, according to DHS.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/house-republicans-foreign-aid/index.html,"Speaker Mike Johnson is telling his House Republican Conference members that he is not rushing to respond to a bill sending aid to Ukraine and Israel, as GOP lawmakers weigh their options for how to handle the Senate-passed package . Johnson told his members at a closed-door meeting Wednesday that there’s “no rush” in deciding how to handle foreign aid, according to GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and did not tip his hand on how he plans to proceed other than making clear he would not put the Senate package on the House floor in its current form. Some rank-and-file members are drawing up their own proposals. Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania said he has been drafting a bipartisan plan to provide aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the border, which he plans to release in the next 24 to 48 hours and brief the speaker on. He said it will include a border security component, but not HR 2, the conservative Republican-led set of border policy changes that the House passed last year, and military aid for Ukraine, but not humanitarian assistance. “You see the conference that we have right now, this is this is essentially a coalition government at this point,” Fitzpatrick said of his strategy to work with Democrats on a plan. While Fitzpatrick said he personally would have supported the Senate version, he recognizes it doesn’t have wide support in the House. Fitzpatrick also said Johnson told members during a closed-door meeting that he has asked for a meeting with President Joe Biden on foreign aid but has so far denied the request. GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas also echoed support for rewriting the foreign aid package so that it only includes military aid for Ukraine, adding the GOP needs to a better job of messaging that a large portion of that funding doesn’t even go overseas, it goes to the Pentagon.

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images Related article Speaker Johnson’s historically narrow House majority will shrink further after Democrats flip seat in New York But some conservatives say they won’t support any Ukraine aid, even if it’s just narrow military aid. Rep. Bob Good, the Virginia Republican and chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said his preference is to just completely ignore the Senate package. But he did say there’s a “possibility” Republicans could support Ukraine aid but only if it is paid for and also has HR 2, plus “enforcement mechanisms” – a high bar that would make it unpalatable in the Senate. “There’s the possibility that the Republican majority would support Ukraine aid paid for, with real border security attached to it,” Good said. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, also a Freedom Caucus member, laid out a number of conditions he would need in order to support Ukraine aid. He said it needs to be paid for and be accompanied by a “strong” border security plan as well as a clear strategy from the White House. “It starts with securing the border of the United States and paying for what we’re talking about, and then figure out where we go from there,” Roy said. “But again, I also want to see a clear mission.” House Republicans debated several ideas to change the Senate-passed foreign aid package during a closed-door party meeting Tuesday night as well, including pairing back money to Ukraine, multiple attendees told CNN. One option that was discussed during the meeting was stripping the aid package of its humanitarian assistance for Ukraine and only including military aid for Ukraine. The thinking is that this could be more palatable to the Republican conference, though some far-right Republicans might still think that’s too much. “I’m looking forward to something we can all agree to. And I think we should have been focused on military aid,” Rep. Don Bacon, a swing district Republican from Nebraska, told CNN. “In my view, there’s a lot of support for military aid right now. The other $20 billion, sending cash over, that’s where you start losing support.” Another idea talked about on Tuesday night was to incorporate some of the funding into portions of an upcoming annual spending bill for the Pentagon. “There may be some chopping and dicing, here and there,” Rep. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, told CNN. “There were three or four really good ideas about, you know, how we can do something?” Johnson has made clear that he would not put the Senate aid package on the floor in its current form. But he may feel pressure to articulate a plan in order to head off potential Republican support for a so-called discharge petition, a procedural maneuver that allows 218 lawmakers who sign on to a petition to force a House floor vote. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would not say whether he would support such a petition, but emphasized at a news conference Wednesday, “Mike Johnson simply needs to put the bipartisan national security bill on the House floor for an up or down vote. And it will pass. That’s it.” President Joe Biden speaks in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 13, in Washington, DC.

But so far, Republicans are signalling they’re not interested in that option. Wagner and Bacon both dismissed the idea. “I don’t believe that signing a discharge petition — a Democrat-led discharge petition — that’d be like voting against the rule, which I just think is, I know some in our party do that now, but I — that’s just not how I think we should comport ourselves,” Wagner said, adding that she supports bifurcating the package. “Not now,” Bacon told CNN’s Manu Raju when asked about a discharge petition. “I think right now, I’m going to talk and discuss and just figure out what’s the next step and not gonna leap too far forward.” The comments underscore the uphill climb Democrats face in successfully circumventing House GOP leaders and forcing a vote on the floor. Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, another supporter of aid to Ukraine, made clear he did not support such a move. “I’ll never sign a discharge petition when we’re in the majority,” he said.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year. When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting. After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month , former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year. In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party. Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year. The exact size of the far right of the House Republican Conference can vary from issue to issue. A contingent of roughly a dozen hardliners staged a rebellion on the House floor last month, taking down a procedural vote to show opposition to a spending deal Johnson had reached with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The ever-shrinking margin has forced Johnson to put some bills directly onto the floor under a procedural move known as suspension of the rules as his right flank has increasingly taken to tanking rule votes on the floor in a show of protest. But that strategy compels the need for a two-thirds majority to pass bills, requiring significant Democratic support, and further alienating Johnson and the right wing of his conference. In addition to facing pressure from conservatives, Johnson must also balance the interests of more moderate members from battleground districts who are on the front lines of the majority and who will be under intense scrutiny this election season. There were 18 Republicans in House districts that President Joe Biden won in 2020 – a number that is now down to 17 after the expulsion of Santos. The fate of these politically vulnerable members will be key to whether the GOP can hold on to its majority."

The number of federal prosecutors who were targets of threats also more than doubled from 68 in fiscal 2021 to 155 in the last fiscal year, according to data from the US Marshals Service. These were threats considered serious enough to warrant an investigation by the Marshals Service, which is responsible for protecting federal judges and court staff. The threat environment has worsened amid a politically divisive time in the United States. A number of threats have been aimed at court officials connected to cases against Donald Trump, including from a Texas woman who was recently sentenced to three years in prison after leaving three threatening voicemails for the judge in Florida who is overseeing the criminal case against the former president over his handling of classified documents. Judges overseeing court cases against Trump in New York , Colorado and Washington, DC , also has been threatened, according to reports and officials. Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over Trump’s federal election subversion case in DC, has been the subject of at least one racist threat and a swatting incident, which are dangerous prank calls made to authorities to lure them to a location under the false pretense that a crime has been committed or is in progress. Chutkan has received a significant increase in protection since being assigned Trump’s case last summer. In another high-profile case, a California man was charged in 2022 with attempting to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after law enforcement arrested him near Kavanaugh’s home outside of DC with a bag containing a gun and burglary tools, according to officials. The man, Nicholas Roske, had called 911 on himself and later told law enforcement he was upset over the leaked draft Supreme Court opinion on abortion rights, among other issues, and had travelled to Maryland to kill a justice, according to officials. Roske has pleaded not guilty, and in recent court filings his attorneys say they are in talks with prosecutors “regarding a pretrial resolution.” CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/jared-kushner-trump-second-term/index.html,"CNN — Donald Trump ’s son-in-law Jared Kushner said Tuesday he does not plan on serving in a second Trump administration as he is committed to focusing on his business ventures. “Nothing in my life has gone according to the plans I’ve set, and that’s been the only consistent thing,” Kushner said at an Axios event in Miami, before emphasizing that he’s been “very clear” in his desire to focus on his private equity firm “at this phase” in his life. Kushner served as a senior adviser in his father-in-law’s administration. He transitioned to the financial sector after leaving the White House, starting a Miami-based investment firm called Affinity Partners Kushner said Tuesday that he’s enjoyed having his family “out of the spotlight” after he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, saw their White House roles end after her father left office. He also said that he was “right now” committed to “my investors, to my firm, to my employees, to my partners, and that’s what I’m planning to do.” Pressed on whether he would turn down an administration job from his father-in-law if asked directly, Kushner answered “yes.” He said Trump has had “time to really reflect” on his third presidential campaign .

During Trump’s White House tenure, Kushner’s fingerprints were on many, if not all , of the administration’s agenda items – from the border wall and immigration to relations with China, criminal justice, trade agreements between Mexico and Canada and the United States, the Middle East and, ultimately, the White House’s coronavirus response. Kushner also headed up the White House Office of American Innovation, whose goal was to modernize government technology. Prior to working in the White House, Kushner had no political experience.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/new-york-special-election-takeaways/index.html,"CNN — Democrat Tom Suozzi is heading back to Congress after defeating Republican Mazi Pilip in the special election to replace serial fabulist and expelled former GOP Rep. George Santos . The result will further narrow the GOP’s already thin House majority and hand President Joe Biden’s party a boost as the general election campaign comes into focus. Suozzi’s success provides Biden and national Democrats with a much-needed narrative reshuffle – a bit of good news during a period when concerns over the president’s paltry poll numbers and intensifying worries over his age, or how it’s perceived by the electorate, has stoked anxieties about the likely coming rematch with former President Donald Trump . Yes, the district broke cleanly for Biden in 2020, but Democrats on Long Island had been losing there ever since – until Tuesday. Both parties poured cash into the race for New York’s 3rd congressional district, but Democrats’ fundraising and registration advantage combined with Suozzi’s brand – he’s spent most of the last 30 years at or around the center of Long Island politics – and a fired-up base, angry over the Santos fiasco, delivered a victory that means the House GOP will now become even harder to corral. For Pilip, who has vowed to run again in the fall, defeat meant an almost immediate rebuke from Trump, who called her a “very foolish woman” in a social media post Tuesday night. Pilip refused until the final days of the campaign to say whether she voted for Trump in 2020, though she did follow his lead in dissing a highly touted bipartisan Senate border bill – a decision that helped Suozzi tie her more tightly to the former president over the last week.

Here's why it matters Officials said poll sites in New York's Queens and Bronx would be open Tuesday despite winter weather Republicans attempt to lower expectations ahead of critical New York special election Santos was expelled from Congress last year in a historic vote Democrats hold cash and advertising edge in New York special election Why New York Democrats are worried about Tuesday’s special election See all updates (54+) Understanding this, Pilip and Republicans set about hammering Suozzi over the migrant crisis in New York City, claiming he caused it along with Biden – a line that ultimately didn’t quite wash with voters who have long recognized Suozzi as a moderate or centrist. When Pilip suggested he was in league with the progressive “squad,” Suozzi at their debate was prepared. “For you to suggest I’m a member of the squad,” he said, “is about as believable as you being a member of George Santos’s volleyball team.” (And that was before a knowing reference to Rick Lazio, which only seasoned New York voters would appreciate.) Most notably, though, Suozzi and state Democratic leaders didn’t repeat their mistakes from 2022. They aggressively countered Pilip’s migrant message and it never felt like the issue, typically a winner for the GOP, put Suozzi on the backfoot. Redemption for top New York Democrats Suozzi’s win is also a major coup for the New York Democratic Party and its leaders, who came under heavy criticism from within over its candidates’ underwhelming performances in the 2022 midterms. Backed by lots of outside cash, new grassroots organizations, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his political operation, along with top state and local Democrats – Gov. Kathy Hochul and state party chair Jay Jacobs, specifically – the party simply could not allow the seat to slip away again. Not after the Santos mess, not with the entire country watching and the White House desperate for a (proxy) win. Victory has a hundred fathers, and they all did some well-deserved peacocking on Tuesday night. If not redemption, the New York Democratic Party in this special election earned a reprieve. Whether it can translate what worked – with different, perhaps weaker candidates – in the fall remains to be seen. But there’s no debating, after this result, that they’ll be given every opportunity. The weather mattered Though not for exactly the reasons one might immediately expect. It snowed heavily in the tri-state area for the first time in years Tuesday, which made travel tricky, closed schools and otherwise disrupted the normal flow of an election day. Good thing then for Democrats that, unlike many Republicans in thrall to Trump, they very much embrace the idea of early voting. As the storm swept through Queens and Long Island on Tuesday, Republican groups and the Pilip campaign scrambled to drive – literally in some cases – their voters to the polls. The top GOP House super PAC made hay on social media over spending a relative pittance on plows to clear roads in Republican-friendly areas. But if the snow didn’t really stick, it appears GOP rank-and-file distaste for banking votes early did. As yet unknown statistics will provide a clearer picture of what went wrong for Pilip, but the weather definitely clouded the picture. Democrats (still) have an Israel problem There stood Suozzi, all smiles, as he prepared to begin his victory speech, when he was interrupted by protesters accusing him of aiding and abetting a “genocide” by Israel in Gaza. Then it happened again. And again. Nevermind his rival was arguably more inclined to support Israel – she was a member of the Israel Defense Forces before moving to the US, after all – in its deadly monthslong military campaign. The interruptions were as much a message to Democrats, especially Biden, as the once and now future congressman from a heavily Jewish district. Though little will be made of a brief demonstration before a speech, the anger among progressive grassroots – young voters even more so – is real, and it is not going away. It might not add up to more votes for Republicans in the fall, but as things stand, it seems sure to eat away at Democratic support. And in an era of fine political margins, that’s a problem. Don’t take away too much This race was always going to take on national significance, both because of the stakes in the House and the makeup of the electorate, which is largely similar to suburban swing districts in presidential battleground states. But Democrats would be wise to remember that Suozzi was a unique – and uniquely talented – candidate with deep ties across Nassau County, where most of the voters reside. A former mayor, he became the first Democrat elected to the county’s top job in more than three decades when he won it in 2002. After losing his bid for a third term and some time away, he returned to become a congressman – winning the seat three times, including a defeat of Santos in 2020, before leaving for a failed gubernatorial bid in 2022. Simply stated, Suozzi had a record, and for all the ads launched against him, voters in the district knew who he was – a moderate who courts labor and will aggressively push for the return of the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, that just about everyone on Long Island wants back after Republicans jettisoned it as part of their 2017 tax cuts. It also remains to be seen how exactly the district-wide vote broke down. Suozzi appears to have exceeded expectations in Queens – a diverse borough of New York City and not a suburb – which could yet mean the town helped him as much as the country. (Democratic Rep. Grace Meng from the neighboring 6th congressional district, and the area’s Asian American voters, delivered above and beyond for Suozzi.) Pilip, on the other hand, was a relative unknown going into the race and a relative unknown coming out of it. A county legislator, she made precious few public appearances, held a handful of notable events outside the district, and seemed unsure of how to position herself in relation to Trump."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/santos-seat-tom-suozzi-mazi-pilip/index.html,"CNN — Democratic former Rep. Tom Suozzi will win a high-stakes special election in New York to succeed disgraced Republican George Santos, a result that will further shrink the House GOP’s narrow majority and provide President Joe Biden and his allies a morale boost as the general election campaign kicks into gear. While Suozzi’s win over Republican Mazi Pilip , who conceded the race less than 90 minutes after polls closed, won’t affect control of the House, the result nevertheless has major implications for the GOP, whose margin for error in the House will shrink further when Suozzi takes office, leaving them with only two votes to spare on any partisan measure – most notably a coming clash over government spending. The special election for the Long Island- and Queens-based 3rd Congressional District could also serve as a bellwether for other suburban races this fall. Republicans flipped several House seats across the New York City suburbs in 2022, including the 3rd District, and the state is once again poised to be a focal point in the battle for control of Congress. The central issues in the special election — including immigration, abortion rights, the Israel-Hamas war and the candidates’ postures toward both Biden and former President Donald Trump — could also define this year’s general election. Suozzi’s tactic of aggressively engaging with GOP attacks, in particular the city’s migrant crisis and anxieties over it in Long Island, could also provide a playbook for Biden and other Democrats banking on victories among similar electorates in the fall. Suozzi didn’t shy away from the national stakes in his speech to supporters Tuesday night, referencing Trump’s successful effort to torpedo a bipartisan border bill on Capitol Hill. “Let’s send a message to our friends running the Congress these days,” Suozzi said. “Stop running around for Trump and start running the country.” Biden’s reelection campaign was also quick to tie Republicans’ failure in Long Island to the former president, saying in a statement, “Donald Trump lost again tonight.” Campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez also made a point of connecting GOP dysfunction on the border legislation to the outcome in New York. “Trump and the MAGA extremists in the House are already paying the political price for derailing a bipartisan deal to secure our borders and fix our broken immigration system,” Chavez Rodriguez said. The 61-year-old Suozzi has been a long-term fixture in local Nassau County politics. A moderate, he previously served as Glen Cove mayor and Nassau County executive, before representing an earlier version of the 3rd District for three terms. He vacated the seat in 2022 for an ultimately unsuccessful bid for governor, and Santos ended up flipping the district that fall. Supporters of Tom Suozzi celebrate as they watch vote counting on a screen during his election night party in Woodbury, New York, on February 13. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters Pilip, 44, is a Nassau County legislator who was making her first bid for federal office. An Israeli immigrant, she was born in Ethiopia and served in the Israel Defense Forces. Under New York’s special election rules, both nominees were selected by county party leaders in the district. In December, Santos became only the sixth lawmaker to be expelled from Congress , bringing to an end a scandal-plagued and tumultuous tenure on Capitol Hill. He has pleaded not guilty to 23 federal charges , including allegations that he stole donors’ identities and ran up thousands of dollars in fraudulent charges on their credit cards, misused campaign funds and lied about his personal finances on House disclosure reports. He faces a possible trial later this year. With his victory in the special election, Suozzi will serve out the remainder of Santos’ term, which ends in January. The primary for the regular full term will be held in June. But the district’s boundaries beyond the special election remain uncertain, as New York’s highest court has ordered the state to redraw its congressional map this year . The state’s Democratic-controlled Legislature would have ultimate say over the new lines . CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/politics/menendez-bribery-scheme-new-filing/index.html,"CNN — Nadine Menendez, wife of New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez , got a diamond engagement ring as part of extensive bribes the couple received in exchange for the senator’s influence, according to a new filing from prosecutors. The ring was purchased for Nadine Menendez as part of a $150,000 bribe for her husband’s intervention in a criminal insurance fraud prosecution, prosecutors said in the Monday filing. Part of the money was used to purchase a Mercedes-Benz convertible for Nadine Menendez, and one of the co-defendants in the case, businessman Wael Hana, purchased the ring for her but kept some of the money for himself, prosecutors allege. Prosecutors claim Hana facilitated an agreement to provide bribes to the couple in exchange for the senator’s influence on matters benefiting himself, the Egyptian government and others. A confidential source communicating with Egypt was seemingly worried about Hana keeping some of the money and said “Wail [Hana] was about to ruin things with Bob. Bob who is starting to listen to us,” according to the new filing. “This complaint—that the failure to deliver the full amount of the promised bribe would harm Menendez’s relationship with Egypt—obviously does not undermine the conclusion that Menendez was in a corrupt relationship for the benefit of Egypt,” prosecutors wrote. “It is instead strong proof that he was.” Menendez and his wife have pleaded not guilty to the charges, as have Hana and two other co-defendants. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Bob Menendez, Nadine Menendez and another co-defendant for comment. An attorney for Hana told CNN he has no comment at this time but will file a response to the government’s motion. Prosecutors also shared more details about the cash investigators found in the basement of the Menendez home, noting that in addition to two bags of approximately $100,000 found on top of a large rack of clothes hangers, prosecutors found four boots “stuffed with cash, including one boot containing in excess of $5,000 in $50 bills, marked with a note stating ‘5350.’” Prosecutors also said Menendez contacted New Jersey mayors in late 2020 and early 2021 “seeking to convince them to authorize the Laboratory Company—a company that was paying Nadine Menendez—to conduct COVID-19 testing,” according to the filing. Prosecutors said Menendez called his wife in January 2019 on her alternate cellphone, “a phone Menendez and Nadine Menendez referred to as her ‘007’ phone, an apparent reference to the fictional character James Bond,” according to the Monday filing. The call was made “before Nadine Menendez requested and received from Hana briefing information about the New Jersey Defendant’s case,” prosecutors wrote. Investigators found “extensive test messages” between Nadine Menendez and another co-defendant in the case. One text asked Nadine to “make things go away,” and prosecutors say she represented that her husband would intervene, according to the filing. There was “substantial evidence that Menendez did in fact know about the corrupt quid pro quo,” prosecutors wrote in the filing."

The foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine, among other priorities. The US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024. Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article How each member of the Senate voted on foreign aid package The bill passed the Senate despite Johnson’s criticism of the legislation and former President Donald Trump signaling opposition to the bill by arguing the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is in the form of a loan. The Senate vote was 70 to 29 with 22 Republicans voting in favor, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “History settles every account,” McConnell said in a statement following the vote. “And today, on the value of American leadership and strength, history will record that the Senate did not blink.” The bill includes $60 billion to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia, $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel, $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance and $4.8 billion to support regional partners in the Indo-Pacific region in addition to other policy provisions, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Johnson told reporters on Tuesday that he is not planning to put the package on the House floor, setting up a major clash between the two chambers. “I certainly don’t,” Johnson said when asked if he plans to put the bill on the floor. “Right now, we’re dealing with the appropriations process, we have immediate deadlines upon us and that’s where the attention is in the House in this moment.” President Joe Biden called on House Republicans to hold a vote on the bill in remarks from the White House, saying that a “minority of the most extreme voices in the House,” should not be permitted to block the bill. The president issued a stark warning, cautioning that if lawmakers fail to act, Russian President Vladimir Putin, “won’t limit himself just to Ukraine, and the costs for America and our allies and partners are going to rise.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Schumer, McConnell and “every US Senator who has supported continued assistance to Ukraine as we fight for freedom, democracy, and the values we all hold dear” in a statement Tuesday. “For us in Ukraine, continued US assistance helps to save human lives from Russian terror. It means that life will continue in our cities and will triumph over war,” Zelensky said on X. “American assistance brings just peace in Ukraine closer and restores global stability, resulting in increased security and prosperity for all Americans and all the free world.” Bill faces Johnson’s opposition in the House The Senate passed the legislation after Republicans blocked a broader bill last week that would have combined foreign aid with a bipartisan border deal. Republicans had initially demanded that border security be part of the bill, but went on to reject the bipartisan border deal amid forceful attacks on the measure by Trump and top House Republicans. In a statement on Monday, Johnson criticized the foreign aid bill over its lack of border provisions, saying, the Senate “should have gone back to the drawing board to amend the current bill to include real border security provisions that would actually help end the ongoing catastrophe.” Johnson had previously opposed the broader bill that did include border provisions. The speaker has characterized those provisions as insufficient, despite the fact that they were the product of bipartisan negotiations and included restrictive border measures. “The House will have to figure out a path forward and they’ll have to do it their way, but we needed to start the process and we’ve done that,” Senate GOP Whip John Thune told reporters on Tuesday. House Republicans debated several ideas to change the Senate-passed foreign aid package during a closed-door party meeting Tuesday night, including paring back money to Ukraine, multiple attendees told CNN. An option that was discussed during the House GOP whips meeting was stripping the aid package of its humanitarian assistance and only including military aid for Ukraine, with the thinking that it could be more palatable to the Republican conference. Another idea was incorporating some of the funding into portions of an upcoming annual spending bill for the Pentagon. No decisions have made been, however, and the issue is expected to be a topic of conversation at Wednesday’s larger House GOP conference meeting. While Johnson has made clear that he would not put the Senate aid passage on the floor in its current form, he may feel pressure to articulate a plan in order to head off potential Republican support for a so-called discharge petition. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries vowed to use “every available legislative tool to get comprehensive national security legislation over the finish line” in a letter to colleagues. Democrats are limited in their options, however, if Johnson does not bring the bill to the floor. Democrats would need to get the support of a majority of the House — or 218 members when every seat is filled — to sign on to an effort to circumvent GOP leadership and force a floor vote. That effort, known on Capitol Hill as a discharge petition, rarely succeeds and would be difficult to pull off. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer celebrated passage of the legislation, saying in remarks on the floor, “It’s been years, perhaps decades, since the Senate passed a bill that so greatly impacts not just our national security, not just the security of our allies, but the security of western democracy.” “I believe that if Speaker Johnson brought this bill to the House floor, it will pass with the same strong bipartisan support,” Schumer said. Trump’s stance on foreign aid looms The Senate continued to move forward on the bill even as Trump argued the US should not grant foreign aid unless it is a loan, signaling opposition to the legislation. Trump has also indicated he would encourage Russian aggression against any NATO member country that doesn’t pay enough. A number of Senate Republicans either defended or downplayed Trump’s NATO comments on Monday. “I’m 100% behind him,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville said of Trump saying NATO members should be paying their dues or risk Putin invading their country. The Alabama Republican also suggested European allies should be “very worried” about an invasion, saying they should protect themselves and not rely on the US, adding the country “can’t protect everybody.” Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said European allies who are worried about Trump’s comments need to “get over it.” “You know, they need to get over it. They need to stand up and be tough. We need to secure our own border first. We need to take care of things here at home first. When we secure our own border, when we take care of home, great. Let’s help other people as well,” the Republican from Kansas said. In the Senate, consideration of the bill crawled along for days as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky vowed to drag out the timeline in protest over the legislation. Paul continued to dig in on Sunday, saying that he will hold out until “hell freezes over.” He indicated he is ready to hold the floor by speaking on the issue of national debt and other matters. “I love to talk. That’s one of my favorite things to do,” he said. “We do this for a purpose,” Paul said. “I don’t like being here. … I’m not here because it’s fun, I’m here because I don’t think enough people are talking about the danger of the debt.” This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/tony-bobulinski-impeachment-investigation/index.html,"A former Biden family business associate levied critical but unproven allegations against President Joe Biden in a closed-door House interview Tuesday, resurrecting claims he has lobbed since 2020. Over the past several years, Tony Bobulinski has seemingly shared his story with anyone who would listen, including the Trump campaign. But his loftiest claims — that Joe Biden was deeply involved in his son’s overseas business deals — are still uncorroborated and have been undercut by other key witnesses. “Joe Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family’s business; he was an enabler, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability,” Bobulinski told House Oversight Committee investigators on Tuesday, according to a copy of his opening statement provided to CNN. He further said he believed the multi-million-dollar business deals secured by Joe Biden’s son and brother only materialized “because Joe Biden was in high office.” He said, “the Biden family business was Joe Biden, period,” and specifically mentioned Joe Biden’s alleged role in a lucrative proposed deal with a Chinese energy conglomerate. CNN has not independently verified the underlying evidence Bobulinski says supports his claims. Bobulinski went public in the final weeks of the 2020 race, only after unsuccessfully peddling his material to reporters, including at the conservative-leaning Wall Street Journal. When the newspaper covered Bobulinski’s public remarks, its story made clear that the China deal never closed, and that corporate records “show no role for Joe Biden.” In his opening statement Tuesday, Bobulinski said he “personally met” with Joe Biden in Los Angeles in May 2017 “multiple times to discuss the broad contours of our business dealings.” House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, praised Bobulinski’s testimony as well as criticized Democrats on the committee for how they participated in the interview. “We will soon release the transcript to provide the American people with transparency about Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s shady schemes and Democrats’ efforts to smear Mr. Bobulinski for blowing the whistle,” Comer said in a statement. While the interview was ongoing, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, slammed Bobulinski’s credibility, saying he was trying to spin two “encounters” with Joe Biden into substantive business meetings. “He had two encounters with President Biden in back-to-back days in May of 2017 that seemed extremely casual,” Raskin said. “They could not be described as meetings. And by his own account, they did not involve discussion of Joe Biden and business. So, this is then a witness who I think can be charitably described as out of control.” “He offers absolutely no testimony that indicates any criminal activity by President Biden. He offers no suggestion or evidence that President Biden was involved in Hunter Biden’s businesses,” Raskin added. Even after first going public in 2020, none of the federal stakeholders including the Justice Department, FBI or IRS have contacted him for his testimony, he said Tuesday. He approached the FBI in October 2020, and sat for an interview, but they never followed up, he said, and neither has the special counsel who is currently prosecuting Hunter Biden. Another business associate involved with Bobulinski and the president’s son recently poured cold water on Bobulinski’s claims in a separate interview with committee investigators. The witness, Rob Walker, told House Republicans in January he did not believe Bobulinski was a credible actor and would never consider working with him again. Walker framed Bobulinski’s allegations as “dumbfounded” and “nonsensical.” He speculated that Bobulinski’s motivations were “political.” “I think he had come to realize that Hunter had moved on without him and he was probably a little pissed also,” Walker added, “So that probably added a little fuel to Tony’s fire.” Walker recalled Bobulinski called him in October 2020 to discuss the possibility of Hunter Biden’s laptop and did not disclose at the time the conversation was being recorded or that it would be shared with Fox News. In the recording, Walker was quoted saying, “You’re just going to bury all of us, man.” In his January interview with lawmakers, Walker elaborated that he was not worried about criminal liability, but rather was concerned that Bobulinski’s antics would make everyone involved look bad. “I thought it was ridiculous that he was going to be – he was going to say something and that made no sense and was stupid and was just going to embarrass everybody,” Walker said. Bobulinski’s claims also stand in stark contrast to a growing list of other Biden family business associates who have stated that Joe Biden, as a private citizen and as vice president, was never involved in his any of his family’s foreign business dealings. Raskin had raised serious questions about Bobulinski’s credibility ahead of Tuesday’s interview. Republicans quickly pounced on Bobulinski’s claims as they seek to implicate the president in his family’s foreign business dealings as part of their impeachment inquiry, and many have praised him going into Tuesday’s interview. But Democrats called out Republicans for using Bobulinski’s allegations to paint the president as central to an elaborate criminal operation, while also questioning his ability to serve in light of special counsel Robert Hur’s final report , which painted a picture of a forgetful commander in chief. “Pick a side,” said Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas. “Either he is a criminal mastermind or he is old and feeble. Or it’s neither one of them.” Perhaps the most compelling piece of evidence ever offered by Bobulinski is an email from May 2017 that he exchanged with Hunter Biden and some of their fellow business partners. In the message, they discuss an equity arrangement for a forthcoming deal involving Chinese energy interests. One of the emails suggests there might be “10 held by H for the big guy,” referring to a 10% equity stake held by Hunter Biden for his father. House Republicans have seized on this email, arguing that it proves their thesis that Joe Biden was in business with his son, and that he made millions from China. But Hunter Biden’s lawyers have countered that the proposed equity breakdown from the email was “never included in any agreement” and that the breakdown was actually proposed by Bobulinski, and never even garnered any response from Hunter Biden. He was teed up for a highly anticipated interview with the GOP-run Senate Judiciary Committee, weeks before the 2020 election. But that was scrapped when he, instead, met with FBI investigators. Despite providing information to the FBI, federal prosecutors haven’t cited his materials in the sweeping tax indictment filed against Hunter Biden. The Justice Department has accused Hunter Biden of tax evasion and other financial crimes over many years. (He pleaded not guilty.) But prosecutors haven’t backed up the Republicans’ claims about the Biden family’s supposed influence-peddling schemes. This story has been updated with additional developments."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/alejandro-mayorkas-impeachment-vote/index.html,"The House of Representatives, by an extremely narrow margin, voted Tuesday to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in almost 150 years. The result came one week after the stunning loss House Republicans suffered when they last tried to impeach Mayorkas and GOP defections and an absence sank the initial floor vote, a move Republicans had hoped to use to spotlight the Biden administration’s handling of the southern border. The impeachment comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold President Joe Biden and his departments and agencies accountable over immigration and border security policies. House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo Kevin Lamarque/Reuters/File Related article How each US House member voted on impeaching Alejandro Mayorkas Only one Cabinet official has previously been impeached in American history: Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. Tuesday’s vote was 214 to 213. Three Republicans – Ken Buck of Colorado, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Tom McClintock of California – voted with Democrats against the measure. The Department of Homeland Security said that House Republicans “will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution” following the vote to impeach. “House Republicans will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution for political gain rather than working to solve the serious challenges at our border,” DHS spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said in a statement. “Secretary Mayorkas and the Department of Homeland Security will continue working every day to keep Americans safe,” the statement said. Last week, the absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the vote to approve the measure. Ken Buck, Tom McClintock, and Mike Gallagher are three House Republicans who voted against impeaching Mayorkas. AP, Getty, Reuters The embarrassing initial defeat of the Mayorkas impeachment effort – which was quickly followed by another floor failure over a standalone Israel aid package – only crystalized the GOP’s yearlong struggle to govern amid a rambunctious and anemic majority . In the fallout of the failed impeachment vote, Republican lawmakers openly aired their frustrations and pointed fingers as to who is to blame, with some questioning their own leadership’s decision-making. “I had many people reach out to me via text message and say, ‘What the hell are you guys doing up there?’ I think our base is a little frustrated,” GOP Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas told CNN. “We may have the gavel, but we’re not acting like we’re in the majority.” “I was embarrassed for our conference, for our party, because we can do better than we did last night,” said GOP Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas. The meltdown – just the latest in a long string of chaotic moments under this GOP majority – is raising fresh concerns over how Republicans will navigate the fast approaching government funding deadline and their ability to maintain control of the House after November. “It was a lousy day. Two bad play calls back to back. Both active choices to schedule them. It was a huge mistake,” said GOP Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, an ally to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. “The speaker is a very nice man,” he said of Speaker Mike Johnson, but added, “He’s gotta learn from his mistakes.” White House spokesman Ian Sams called the failed impeachment vote a “baseless, unconstitutional impeachment stunt” and said there is “bipartisan agreement” that it should fail. When presented with a bipartisan legislative solution negotiated with Senate Republicans however, GOP House members flatly rejected it , which contributed to the ultimate squashing of the deal. Even with Mayorkas impeached in the House, it is highly unlikely that he will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office said in a statement, “The House impeachment managers will present the articles of impeachment to the Senate following the state work period. Senators will be sworn in as jurors in the trial the next day. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray will preside.” “This sham impeachment effort is another embarrassment for House Republicans,” Schumer said in a statement. “The one and only reason for this impeachment is for Speaker Johnson to further appease Donald Trump.” While Republicans have been investigating Mayorkas’ handling of the border since they reclaimed the House majority, momentum to plot a swift impeachment of the secretary picked up steam last month as key swing-district Republicans expressed fresh openness to the idea amid a recent surge of migrant crossings at the southern border . Mayorkas has sent a letter to House Republicans to defend his record in public service in advance of the vote. “My reverence for law enforcement was instilled in me by my parents, who brought me to this country to escape the Communist takeover of Cuba and allow me the freedoms and opportunity that our democracy provides,” Mayorkas said. Mayorkas wrote that “the problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new” and called on Congress to help provide a legislative solution to the “historically divisive issue.” He praised the bipartisan group of senators he has worked with for its willingness to put their differences aside to try to find solutions at the border. Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee have repeatedly bashed their Republican colleagues for their efforts to impeach Mayorkas and have released a report calling the GOP effort “a sham.” Instead of formally launching an impeachment inquiry with a House floor vote, the GOP effort to impeach Mayorkas has been unilaterally run through the Homeland Security Committee as opposed to the House Judiciary Committee, where impeachment articles typically originate, though it is not constitutionally required. In the investigative phase, Homeland Security Committee Republicans held 10 hearings, published five interim reports and conducted 11 transcribed interviews with current and former Border Patrol agents. But since launching the inquiry, the GOP-led panel has held only two hearings and has decided to move forward with impeachment articles without giving the secretary an opportunity to testify. Republicans invited Mayorkas to testify at an impeachment hearing on January 18. But the DHS secretary said he was hosting Mexican Cabinet members to discuss border enforcement, and he asked to work with the committee on scheduling a different date, according to a letter obtained by CNN.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/steve-scalise-interview/index.html,"House Majority Leader Steve Scalise defended Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to hold last week’s failed vote on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, telling CNN in an interview the vote was a “tough judgement call” and that it may have helped lock in GOP lawmakers on the fence. “They felt it was important, there were some members that you know, might have been going back and forth, and to lock them in,” Scalise said ahead of a second vote to impeach Mayorkas scheduled for Tuesday evening . “I know these are all tough judgment calls, but to make sure that you lock everybody into who’s a ‘yes,’ and now we know we’re one vote short, and let’s go get that done,” Scalise added. Scalise missed last week’s impeachment vote – which failed in an embarrassing defeat, 214-216, with three House Republicans voting against it – but he’s back in Washington on Tuesday and in “complete remission” following successful stem cell treatment for a form of blood cancer. So long as there are no more unforeseen absences, Scalise’s return will make him the decisive vote allowing Republicans to impeach Mayorkas. The vote is occurring the same night that New York is holding a special election to replace expelled former Republican Rep. George Santos, giving Democrats the opportunity to make the GOP’s razor-thin majority in the House even tighter. While Republicans won the district in 2022 with Santos, Scalise sought to downplay expectations, noting that Republican candidate Mazi Pilip is going up against former Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi in a congressional district that President Joe Biden carried in 2020. “The whole Democratic apparatus of the state of New York is supporting Suozzi in a Democrat-leaning seat,” Scalise said. “So, if we’re able to pull this off, it would be a real kind of shock-the-world moment and show that the Republicans can win in tough places.” If Democrats win Tuesday night, Scalise would not say whether Republicans would regret that Santos, who is facing federal charges, was kicked out of Congress. “At the end of the day, that happened, the House did its will, you can’t undo that. So, the real question is, can we still hold the seat?” Scalise asked. “Santos was a surprise when he flipped that seat. So you know, we’re going to be working hard to hold it. And the Democrats are surely pulling out every stop to try to get it as well.” Scalise backed Johnson’s vow not to take up the Senate’s $95.3 billion foreign aid bill that passed 70-29 early Tuesday morning . While GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell called on Johnson to hold a vote on the measure, which includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, the House speaker has said that the package must also include border security – even though House Republicans swiftly rejected a border compromise struck by the Senate earlier this month. Scalise said that the Senate deal did not have any key policies from the Republican immigration bill that passed the House last year. “That bill is still sitting over in the Senate, but those policies have to be part of any kind of deal,” Scalise said. “We’ve been clear from the beginning that you’ve got to actually focus on securing America’s border, especially when you’re talking about Ukraine.” Scalise said that Johnson had requested a meeting with Biden on the border, but that the president had rejected it. “If the President really does want Ukraine funding, shouldn’t he be sitting down with the speaker now?” Scalise said. Scalise said that an immigration bill was “not just about getting, you know, a few people in a room together and saying let’s pass a bill that we can all agree on” – a reference to the Senate’s negotiations, which included Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma. Asked what message it would send to allies around the world not to pass an aid package to Ukraine, Scalise argued that the US has already provided billions. “We already passed billions of dollars in funding for Ukraine, so we clearly support their efforts to push back on the Russians’ aggression,” Scalise said. “The question is right now, can we also get an agreement on securing America’s border? And shouldn’t that be the front-and-center debate right now? Shouldn’t the president be engaged in that debate with the House Republican majority?” Scalise defended former President Donald Trump’s comments on NATO over the weekend – when the former president said that he once told a NATO country’s leader he’d encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” if the country didn’t pay their fair share in defense – saying that when he ran in 2016, Trump successfully prodded European countries to spend more on defense. NATO members are supposed to commit 2% of their GDP to defense spending, though many countries in the alliance do not meet that goal. “President Trump was good in pointing out that if this is about America helping protect Europe, shouldn’t Europe be paying their fair share more than anybody?” Scalise asked. “So you’ve even seen countries like Poland that are approaching 2% because they recognize now how important this relationship is, and that you can’t just count on the US to fund the whole thing when the agreement was every country pays their fair share,” Scalise said. “That, I think, is what President Trump continues to talk about. President Biden hadn’t pushed those countries to pay their fair share.” Scalise declined to weigh in on a symbolic resolution from Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz and other Trump allies declaring that Trump never incited an insurrection or rebellion on January 6. Scalise said that he hadn’t read the resolution – another example of Trump’s allies seeking to rewrite the narrative about January 6 – and that it would go through the committee process. The House majority leader was critical of the legal cases against Trump blending into the presidential election, saying there shouldn’t be efforts to kick Trump off the ballot or trials right before Election Day. Asked about the GOP impeachment inquiry into Biden, Scalise said that process was continuing. “We have a process that’s playing out with President Biden, it’s an impeachment inquiry that we’re in the middle of right now,” Scalise said, noting Republicans continued to collect testimony this week. Scalise said that the stem cell treatment he received for his blood cancer forced him to isolate for six weeks while his immune system recovered, but he’s happy to be back in Washington. “I feel great,” Scalise said. “Being out for six weeks was tough, but it’s really good to be back.” This story has been updated with additional developments."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/lloyd-austin-hospital/index.html,"CNN — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was released from the hospital Tuesday afternoon after being treated for a bladder issue and is expected to return to the Pentagon “later this week,” the Defense Department said. He resumed his full duties from home at 5 p.m., approximately 48 hours after he had first transferred his responsibilities to his deputy, Kathleen Hicks. Austin will “recuperate and perform his duties remotely from home for a period before returning to work at the Pentagon later this week,” the Pentagon said in a statement. Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said earlier Tuesday that Austin was “in good condition” and that the Pentagon anticipated he would be released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center later in the day. The bladder issue that hospitalized Austin on Sunday was not related to the prostate cancer diagnosis he received in Decembe﻿r, Singh said. Doctors at Walter Reed said it was related to the surgery to treat the cancer. Complications from the procedure first sent Austin to the hospital on New Year’s Day, where he stayed for two weeks. The cause of the recent bladder issue was identified and was treated with a non-surgical procedure on Monday, doctors said. The secretary, Singh said, still anticipates participating in and providing opening remarks at the virtual Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday. Austin’s recent hospitalization came just weeks after he was admitted in January following complications from a procedure to treat his prostate cancer. He was intensely criticized for a dayslong delay in notifying the White House of that hospitalization, for which he has said he takes full responsibility. “I want to be crystal clear: We did not handle this right. And I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility,” Austin said at a news conference this month. “I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.” An administration official told CNN on Tuesday that President Joe Biden and Austin spoke by phone on Tuesday, and the president wished “him well in his recovery.” A statement from Austin’s doctors on Monday said Austin underwent “non-surgical procedures under general anesthesia to address his bladder issue.” They added that they believed he would make a “successful recovery.” They have also said Austin is “expected to make a full recovery” from his cancer diagnosis.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/new-york-special-election-what-to-watch/index.html,"CNN — The special election to replace former Rep. George Santos in New York’s 3rd Congressional District, an emerging battleground that could serve as a bellwether for other suburbs this fall, appears to be headed for a neck-and-neck finish after two months of campaigning bolstered by millions in outside spending. The district, which encompasses Nassau County on Long Island and northeast Queens, is largely well-educated and affluent – the kind of place Democrats now expect to win – but because of its ideological diversity, a recent trend toward the GOP and a deeply rooted county Republican Party machine, it has become a true Election Day wild card. Rep. Tom Suozzi, Democratic candidate for New York's 3rd Congressional District, and Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., left, conduct the ""Women For Suozzi Rally,"" in Port Washington, New York, on Saturday, February 3. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/AP Related article New York Democrats are worried about Tuesday’s special election. They have good reason to be Tuesday’s outcome could provide lessons for both parties as the general election season nears and both the presidential contest and the race for control of the House are expected to turn, in large part, on the views of suburban voters. In the near term, victory for Democrat Tom Suozzi, who previously represented the district in Congress after running Nassau County for most of the 2000s, would provide a lift for President Joe Biden – who won the district by 8 points in 2020 – and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, who will likely need the seat if he’s to become speaker next year. Victory for Republican Mazi Pilip, a largely unknown county legislator from Great Neck, would signal the potential for more GOP gains across the country – and provide some comfort to a slate of freshmen GOP House members from New York who will be defending their seats in November. Suozzi’s election as Nassau County executive in 2001 broke Republicans’ 30-year lock on the position. After losing his bid for a third term in 2009, then falling in Democratic primaries for statewide office, Suozzi was elected to the US House in 2016. He was reelected two more times before leaving the seat for another unsuccessful campaign for governor. But his brand remains strong on Long Island, which led the party to handpick him as the nominee after the special election was called. Pilip is lesser known in the district but has the powerful county party – which also controls most local offices in Nassau – driving her campaign, which, if successful, would provide the clearest proof yet that Republicans are once again the political kings of Long Island. She would also be the first Black Republican to represent New York in Congress. Here’s what to watch for: The three I’s and abortion Immigration, inflation, Israel and the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade framed the political landscape on Long Island while Santos served his final days in office last year. A couple of months on, they remain – along with the cost of housing – the big issues facing the candidates. Immigration, though, has become – if not the most important – then the most talked about issue in the campaign. Pilip has repeatedly hammered Suozzi over a past clash with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and sought to direct anger over the migrant crisis in nearby New York City his way. In their only debate last week, Pilip said Suozzi “voted to open the borders” and, along with Biden, “created the migrant crisis” during his time in Congress. Though that might seem like a bit of a stretch given Suozzi’s position, frustration with border policy is a potent political tool – especially on Long Island, where voters largely get their news from city outlets and view the city’s problems as previews of their own. Inflation remains an important topic, but less so than perhaps a year or so ago when prices were soaring. Israel has been a point of discussion, if not debate. Suozzi is a staunch supporter, as is Pilip, who emigrated there and served in the Israel Defense Forces before coming to the US. Abortion, though, could yet again emerge as an X-factor. Suozzi supports abortion rights and wants to codify Roe v. Wade. Pilip is more difficult to pin down. She calls herself “pro-life” but has said, “When it comes to abortion, every woman should have the choice to make that decision” and that she would not vote for a federal ban. During the debate, Suozzi pressed her repeatedly to stake out a clearer position. After a long back-and-forth, though, the question remained unsettled. The Suozzi brand vs. the GOP machine Suozzi has deep roots in the district. He is a moderate – campaigning, governing and legislating as one. If there had been a primary for the nomination, he probably would have attracted a more liberal challenger. So Pilip’s and GOP allies’ attacks suggesting he’s a “ Squad ” wannabe didn’t land with too many voters here. But there is another brand to consider: the Democrats. The party has lost races at almost every level on Long Island beginning in 2021, and Republicans are following a similar playbook this year, hammering Suozzi (and Biden) over New York City’s migrant crisis , along with rising cost-of-living and housing concerns. Neither candidate is advertising their party affiliation on the thousands of lawn signs across the county, and both have steered clear of national party leaders, at least publicly. However, the singular question entering Election Day is whether Suozzi’s generally positive reputation is enough to overcome a powerful GOP machine that is primed to drive – perhaps literally, in some cases – its supporters to the polls. The weather! Early voting numbers showed registered Democrats turning out at a higher clip, but operatives in both parties aren’t investing much in the information. Democrats tend to vote early; Republicans usually prefer casting their ballots on Election Day. The twist Tuesday is that the New York City metropolitan area saw a surge of snow early morning from a strong and fast-moving nor’easter . Long Island is relatively condensed – in comparison with a place like Iowa, at least – but the snow and sleet could potentially disadvantage Republicans. Congressional Leadership Fund, a leading House GOP super PAC, hired multiple snow plows to help with get-out-the-vote efforts Tuesday, the group said. Speaking outside a polling place in Massapequa on Tuesday, Pilip said her campaign and allies would provide rides for people who want to get to the polls. “This is a day we have been working very hard for the last eight weeks,” she said. Suozzi also said his campaign was also offering rides to the polls, with about 30 people out as drivers. “The weather’s falling on the Democrats and Republicans. Nice and bipartisan – just the way I like things,” he said while campaigning in Uniondale. Remember George Santos? The shunned charlatan has been mostly out of sight and mind since being expelled from Congress last year over assorted personal lies, misconduct and alleged crimes. And for all the hoopla surrounding his brief stint as the district’s nominal “representative,” the specter of Santos is not expected to play a big role in the outcome. That’s in part because Suozzi has mostly ignored the sage, figuring that’s not what will influence the swing voters he needs to win back his old seat. Democratic operatives also believe that any Santos bounce was baked into the campaign a long time ago – with previously unengaged Democratic voters angry over his deceptions and primed now to vote and, in many cases, volunteer for Suozzi. Pilip has obviously not spent too much time talking about Santos, but Republicans are banking on an idea that, as the county becomes increasingly Trump-pilled, conservatives might turn out if for no other reason than to stick it to the Democrats, who, in this telling, drove the duly elected Republican out of office. Note: Almost all local GOP officials and officeholders called for Santos to resign, and the vote to expel him from Congress was a rare bipartisan success.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/rfk-jr-democrats-trump-attacks/index.html,"CNN — The Democratic Party has ramped up its attacks on independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in recent days, marking the first significant attempt by either party to shape voter sentiment around his candidacy ahead of a potential rematch of the 2020 election. The Democratic National Committee has taken multiple steps in recent days to portray Kennedy as a spoiler who would help Republican frontrunner Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden , arguing Kennedy is funded primarily by wealthy donors aligned with the former president. Last week, the DNC filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Kennedy’s campaign had illegally coordinated with American Values 2024, a PAC backing his White House bid. Kennedy’s campaign has denied coordinating with the group. In a call with reporters outlining the complaint, DNC adviser Ramsey Reid blamed Trump and his donors for turning Kennedy into a “stalking horse” by funding the PAC. “We’re concerned that Donald Trump is disrespecting the democratic process. It’s pretty clear that Trump and his megadonors are propping up RFK Jr. as a stalking horse,” Reid said. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks during a campaign event ""Declare Your Independence Celebration"" at Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County on October 12, 2023 in Miami, Florida. Eva Marie Uzcategui/Getty Images Related article RFK Jr. apologizes to cousins offended by Super Bowl ad’s reference to JFK The DNC has homed in on donations to the PAC from billionaire Tim Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking fortune who has been a prolific donor to pro-Trump and other GOP causes over the years. Mellon gave approximately $15 million to American Values 2024 last year. In 2020, he gave $20 million to America First Action Inc., one of the leading outside groups backing Trump’s reelection. On Saturday, as Kennedy held a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the DNC advertised on four billboards around the area accusing Kennedy of being “powered by MAGA/Trump.” And after the Kennedy-aligned PAC released a new TV ad during the Super Bowl that repurposed an old spot from the 1960 campaign of President John F. Kennedy, the candidate’s uncle, the DNC issued a statement highlighting the PAC’s funding from Mellon. “It’s fitting that the first national ad promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s candidacy was bought and paid for by Donald Trump’s largest donor this cycle,” DNC rapid response director Alex Floyd said in a statement released shortly after the ad aired Sunday. Kennedy’s team pushed back on the Democratic attacks, saying that donors “from across the political spectrum are supporting the Kennedy campaign as they are tired of the corruption in the two-party system.” “Instead, donors want an independent candidate who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, end the forever wars, unravel corporate capture, and the end chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN. DNC adviser Lis Smith told CNN the party’s latest efforts are meant to educate voters on the connections between Trump and Kennedy, while acknowledging the critical role Kennedy could play in the general election. “It’s clear that Donald Trump and his allies view him as a useful stalking horse who could help throw the election to Trump in November,” Smith said. While his independent campaign faces steep odds of success, Kennedy’s candidacy could influence the outcome of a Biden-Trump rematch if he garners enough support in critical states. In the 2020 election, Biden flipped three states – Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin – by margins of less than 1%. Recent national polling of a Trump-Biden rematch suggests the race could be narrowly decided again. A CNN/SSRS poll released earlier this month showed Trump with 49% support among registered voters, compared with 45% for Biden. It’s unclear as of now how Kennedy would affect a potential general election between Biden and Trump – whether he’d draw more support from historically Republican or Democratic voters, or whether he’d receive enough total support to influence the election either way. An NBC News poll released this month found 34% of registered voters saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy. But Kennedy’s allies have targeted Biden and Democrats as they look to gain traction in the race, a sign they’re ready to meet the DNC’s escalating attacks straight ahead. In a statement released after the Super Bowl ad, American Values 2024 co-founder Mark Gorton criticized the DNC for its efforts targeting Kennedy. “The only argument the DNC has left is that Biden is not Trump. When RFK Jr. gets on the ballot, the American public will have the ability to choose a candidate who is not Trump, who has integrity, bravery, a proven track record of fighting corporate corruption, and the ability to stand up to the corporate interests that have taken over the Biden administration. The American people are waking up, and the DNC’s only hope is to prevent them from having a choice,” Gorton said. This story has been updated with additional information.

The family also said that US officials have not been granted consular access to her more than a week after her detention. The family said that Esmail, 46, was “dragged” from her home by IDF members and “beaten badly in Israeli custody.” They also said her home was destroyed in the raid. “Despite having had her prescription medication from the moment they arrested her, the IDF has declined to administer it,” the family statement said. “Despite having a clear obligation to grant Consular access, the Netanyahu government has declined daily requests from the U.S. Embassy for permission to visit Ms. Esmail.” The IDF confirmed Esmail’s detention, saying she was “arrested for incitement on social media,” but did not respond to the allegations of mistreatment raised by the family. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said he could not speak to the specific claims made by the family, citing privacy laws. “In any of these circumstances, whether it be in Israel or elsewhere, we seek consular access, we seek access to the individual and we talk to their family when appropriate,” he said at a department press briefing Tuesday. “We try to ensure that detainees or people who are arrested are treated fairly, are treated humanely, have full access to due process, have access to counsel,” he continued. “As is often the case, due to privacy considerations that are just in the law that don’t give me any wiggle room at all, I’m unable to speak in detail about this,” Miller said, but noted that his lack of ability to speak about the case should not be misinterpreted “as a lack of activity by the United States.” In a statement to CNN Tuesday, the IDF said Esmail was arrested during “a battalion operation that took place in the area of the village of Silwad to arrest terror suspects” on February 5. “All those arrested in the operation were transferred to the security forces for further treatment,” the IDF said. The IDF did not address the family’s claims about Esmail’s mistreatment in custody and referred further questions to the Israel Prison Service, to whom CNN has reached out. The IDF response also did not provide further details about the alleged “incitement on social media.” According to the family, Esmail was detained because of “10-year-old Facebook posts and political cartoons she shared.” Posts from Esmail’s Facebook seen by CNN show cartoons favorably depicting Hamas and two photos of her holding a gun. Family spokesperson Jonathan Franks said the gun is in Louisiana, where Esmail also resides and legally owns the firearm. “Ms. Esmail’s opinions may be disfavored in Israel proper, but the inescapable reality is they were protected speech which no rational person could consider an incitement to violence,” the statement released by Franks on behalf of the family said. The statement said she has not been formally charged with a crime. According to the statement, Esmail was presented to a military commission on Monday and was granted bail, but the IDF appealed the ruling. “Ms. Esmail’s ‘arrest’ is just more evidence that the Israeli government of the day is out of control. The fact that the U.S. Embassy has been denied access to Ms. Esmail for eight days is outrageous, and one wonders if the Israeli government doesn’t want a U.S. consular officer to see the bruises that Ms. Esmail’s (Israeli) lawyer says cover her body,” the family said. They called on the US to do more to obtain consular access to Esmail. “The United States is not without tools to obtain consular access to Ms. Esmail and to end her ordeal. It just has to find the moral courage to do so, which has been, thus far, a tall order,” the statement said. Esmail is not the only American to have been detained in the Palestinian territories recent days. Two other Americans, Hashem Alagha, 20, and Borak Alagha, 18, were detained by Israeli forces during a raid of a home in Gaza last week, according to a family member in the United States. Miller was also unable to give updates on their case, citing privacy laws. In addition to the detentions, two Palestinian-Americans have been killed in less than a month in the West Bank. 17-year-old Mohammad Ahmed Mohammad Khdour was shot in the head by Israeli forces on Saturday while traveling by car in the town of Biddu, according to the organization “Defense for Children – Palestine.” Last month, another American, 17-year-old Tawfic Abdel, was fatally shot in the head, according to Palestinian news agency WAFA. On that case, Miller noted that there is an ongoing investigation into the death, and if “that investigation finds that there should be accountability, we expect there to be accountability.” “We are still at the information-gathering process with this second case, but as is always the case, if the information leads us to believe there should be further investigation or accountability measures, we’ll, of course, call for those for those both publicly and privately,” he said.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/paul-whelan-blinken-phone-call/index.html,"CNN — US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Monday with Paul Whelan , an American who has been detained in Russia for more than five years, the top US diplomat said Tuesday. “Our intensive efforts to bring Paul home continue every single day. And they will until he and Evan Gershkovich and every other American wrongfully detained is back with their loved ones,” Blinken said at an event on hostage diplomacy at the Wilson Center. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Tuesday that Blinken “assured Paul Whelan, as he has in his previous calls, that we’re with you. We have not forgotten you. We continue to work to try to secure your release and we will continue to work to try to secure your release.” “Your release is a top priority, not just for the secretary, but for President Biden as well,” Miller said. This is at least the third time the top US diplomat has spoken by phone with the ex-Marine, who has been declared wrongfully detained by the US State Department. The two also spoke in August 2023 and December 2022. Whelan told CNN that in the August call, he told Blinken “point blank that leaving me here the first time painted a target on my back and leaving me here the second time basically signed a death warrant.” Whelan has consistently urged the Biden administration to do its utmost to secure his release, expressing frustration at being left behind in two prior prisoner swaps with Russia. The US has said Russian officials refused to negotiate for his release in those swaps. On the fifth anniversary of his detention, Whelan called on President Joe Biden to “please use every resource available to secure my release as you would do if your own son had been taken hostage.” “I’m more than past ready to return home and I’m counting on the US government to come for me and soon. The time is now to take decisive action and bring this debacle to a close,” Whelan told CNN from his prison camp in Mordovia. In the more than half a dozen phone conversations Whelan has had with CNN, he has expressed both confidence that the US government is working to secure his release and immense frustration that those efforts have not yielded success. Miller reiterated on Monday that the US has “put a significant offer on the table” to try to secure Whelan and Gershkovich’s release. “In fact, more than once we have put offers on the table to secure their release, and we will continue to engage to try to pursue, or try to obtain their release,” he said at a press briefing."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/biden-trump-nato-comments/index.html,"Washington CNN — President Joe Biden on Tuesday slammed Donald Trump after the former president said he would encourage Russia to invade countries that don’t meet their NATO obligations, saying such comments amount to bowing down to Vladimir Putin. The remarks – Biden’s latest criticism of Trump from the White House – are some of his harshest criticism of his likely rival on foreign policy to date. Speaking Saturday at a rally in South Carolina, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense. Biden said those comments sent a “dangerous and shocking” signal. “Can you imagine a former president of the United States saying that?” Biden asked incredulously from the State Dining Room. “The whole world heard it. The worst thing is he means it.” Biden began his speech by encouraging the House of Representatives to “immediately” hold a vote on the Senate-passed, $95 billion supplemental aid package that would provide assistance to Ukraine, Israel and US partners in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. More than $60 billion from the Senate package would have been allocated to Ukraine, as the country prepares to mark the second anniversary of its full-scale invasion by Russia. Previous attempts to pass an aid package – combined with a border security bill – were scuttled after Trump came out in opposition. Trump’s comment drew immediate consternation, not only from the American foreign policy establishment but from NATO allies, who have watched warily as Russia proceeds with its invasion of Ukraine. For Biden, who has spent much of his career working on issues related to transatlantic security, the remark was particularly galling. When he heard about the remarks afterward, the president was aghast, according to a person familiar with the matter. He later issued a statement through his campaign decrying the sentiment. The White House criticized Trump’s comments shortly after they were made. “Encouraging invasions of our closest allies by murderous regimes is appalling and unhinged – and it endangers American national security, global stability, and our economy at home,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement on Saturday. Former President Donald Trump arrives on stage during a Get Out The Vote rally at Coastal Carolina University on February 10 in Conway, South Carolina. Win McNamee/Getty Images But Biden’s criticism of Trump from the White House went a step further. In a speech that mentioned Trump by name at least a half-dozen times, Biden sought to forcefully rebut questions about American commitment to its allies. “No other president in our history has bowed down to a Russian dictator,” Biden went on. “Let me say this as clearly as I can: I never will. For God’s sake, it’s dumb. It’s shameful. It’s dangerous. It’s un-American.” On Tuesday, Biden spent a significant portion of his speech on Ukraine aid going after Trump for the remark, which he said undercut longstanding US values. “When America gives its word, it means something. When we make a commitment, we keep it and NATO is a sacred commitment,” Biden said. “Donald Trump looks at this as if it’s a burden,” he added. He said Trump viewed the defense alliance as a “protection racket” and didn’t understand its role in protecting freedom and security. “For Trump, principles never matter. Everything is transactional,” Biden said. He said American adversaries “all cheered” when they heard Trump’s comments. “I will not walk away. I can’t imagine any other president walking away,” Biden said."

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/politics/nikki-haley-joe-biden-resign/index.html,"CNN — Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Tuesday said she thinks President Joe Biden should resign, as it would be in “the best interest of the country.” Asked by radio host Hugh Hewitt during an interview if she believes the president should step down, Haley responded: “Yes, I do.” “I think the Democrat Party knows that and I think that it is not just in the best interest of their party. It’s in the best interest of the country. What I will tell you – and I have said this from the very beginning – the party that gets rid of their 80-year-old candidate is the party that will win,” Haley said. “We cannot have a country in disarray and a world on fire and have two presidential candidates in their 80s when we need someone who’s going to put eight years into making sure that we are disciplined, focused on getting our economy, the border, preventing war, and getting our country back on track,” she added. Haley has made similar calls for years – she cited Biden’s foreign policy as a reason he should step aside in early 2022, and last month, after it was revealed that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did not disclose a hospitalization, she said Biden should be “fired” over the controversy. But Tuesday’s remark is especially pointed as Haley is trying to gain traction ahead of a crucial GOP primary in her home state of South Carolina and as questions over Biden’s fitness for office have been renewed in the wake of special counsel Robert Hur’s report, which, although it did not charge the president with a crime, painted a picture of apparent lapses in memory after Biden failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information. The former South Carolina governor has frequently taken digs at Biden, who is 81, and former President Donald Trump, 77, over their age, arguing they are both too old to serve another four years as president. Haley, 52, has also been adamant about calling for term limits and mental competency tests for any politician over the age over the age of 75."

(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser ) With the GOP hanging on to a razor-thin majority in the House, national Republicans and Democrats poured big bucks into a race where immigration and border security , crime and abortion were the top issues, and where the election was seen as a bellwether ahead of the all-but-certain November White House rematch between Trump and President Biden. The Long Island district, held for a decade by Democrats, was flipped by Santos in the 2022 midterms. However, Santos was kicked out of Congress less than a year into his tenure, after he was exposed for lying about his background and indicted for a slew of financial crimes. Suozzi, who represented the district for six years before running unsuccessfully for governor, repeatedly tied Pilip to Santos, as well as to Trump. With the Republican majority in the House slipping to 219-213 once Suozzi is sworn in, the pickup by the Democrats now puts the GOP's grip on the chamber further in peril. Pilip, an Ethiopian Jew who fled to Israel at age 12 to escape persecution and later enlisted and served in the Israeli military before immigrating to the U.S., was a former Democrat who argued the party ""left me and many others"" She repeatedly tied Suozzi to Biden and blamed her opponent for the migrant crisis.

FIRST ON FOX: Former Vice President Mike Pence's policy think tank, Advancing American Freedom (AAF), sent a memo to senators Wednesday pushing back against Sen. JD Vance's theory that the $95 billion foreign aid package contains an ""impeachment"" clause for the next administration hidden in its text. AAF's memo comes after Vance circulated a memo ahead of the national security supplemental package vote Monday arguing the bill includes a provision that could be grounds to impeach former President Donald Trump if he wins the White House again. The text assures the delivery of $1.6 billion to finance Ukraine's military as well as just under $14 billion for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative through Sept. 30, 2025 – the same aid mechanism that Trump temporarily paused while pushing for an investigation into Biden family foreign business dealings. ""The president’s duty to faithfully execute the law is written into the Constitution,"" AAF's memo reads. ""It’s not an ‘impeachment time bomb’ created by the foreign aid package."" A spokesperson for Vance told Fox News Digital that the AAF memo repeated talking points circulated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a long-time advocate of aid to Ukraine.

JD Vance warned his Republican colleagues that the proposed Ukraine aid bill could be used to impeach former President Trump if he wins re-election in November. The Trump administration, through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), withheld a total of about $400 million in security assistance from Ukraine in 2019. This came just before Trump asked Ukrainian President Voldomyr Zelenskyy to investigate the family of his 2020 rival, Joe Biden, and while the White House allegedly was withholding an Oval Office visit from Zelenskyy in exchange for an investigation. These actions are what fueled the impeachment effort against Trump, in which he was ultimately acquitted. Mark Paoletta, former OMB general counsel during the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital in a statement this week that the clause in the bill text is an ""effort to inappropriately tie President Trump’s hands in his next term by locking in Ukraine funding for multiple years.""

Special counsel Jack Smith has requested that the U.S. Supreme Court reject former President Donald Trump's bid to delay his 2020 election interference from going to trial. Trump’s legal team requested the delay be extended earlier this week as the court considers whether to take up the question whether the former president is immune from prosecution for official acts in the White House . Two lower courts have overwhelmingly rejected that argument, prompting Trump to ask the high court to intervene. Prosecutors responded to Trump's appeal within two days even though the court had given them until next Tuesday. Donald Trump and Jack Smith (Getty Images) Though their filing does not explicitly mention the upcoming November election or Trump's status as the Republican primary front-runner , prosecutors described the case as having ""unique national importance"" and said that ""delay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a speedy and fair verdict."" Smith's team charged Trump in August with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. TRUMP DEMANDS DOJ ‘IMMEDIATELY’ DROP CHARGES AGAINST HIM IN CLASSIFIED DOCS CASE AFTER BIDEN DECISION Trump's lawyers, meanwhile, have argued that he is shielded from prosecution for acts that fell within his official duties as president — a legally untested argument since no other former president has been indicted. The trial judge and then a federal appeals court rejected those arguments, with a three-judge appeals panel last week saying, ""We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter."" The Trump campaign said NBC News reporter Vaughn Hillyard was not banned or barred based on his reporting. (Ellen Schmidt/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) The proceedings have been effectively frozen by Trump's immunity appeal, with U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan canceling a March 4 trial date while the appeals court considered the matter. No new date has been set. Earlier Wednesday, prosecutors urged the court to reject Trump's petition to hear the case, saying that lower court opinions rejecting immunity for the former president ""underscore how remote the possibility is that this Court will agree with his unprecedented legal position.""

Some Senate Republicans want the upper chamber to reconvene ""immediately"" to proceed with an impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the ongoing migrant crisis at the southern border. The House voted to impeach Mayorkas Tuesday night in a tight 214-213 vote. Mayorkas is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached by the U.S. Congress since 1876. ""Schumer should reconvene the Senate immediately and proceed to trial,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wrote in a post on X Tuesday night. Fox News Digital reached out to Schumer's office for comment and did not hear back by time of publication. But in a statement Tuesday night after the vote, Schumer said the impeachment trial will begin later this month. The Senate is scheduled to return from recess on Feb. 26. ""The House impeachment managers will present the articles of impeachment to the Senate following the state work period,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""Senators will be sworn in as jurors in the trial the next day."" HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS Sen.

""Chuck Schumer is trying to sweep this travesty under the rug by violating the constitution and foregoing a trial. Republican leadership cannot stand idly by and let him,"" he wrote. Echoing the urgency, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. urged the upper chamber to take quick action: ""The Senate must take this up immediately."" ""While some in the Senate sided with securing Ukraine's border before our own, I'm glad to see House Republicans do the right thing and hold this lawless administration accountable,"" he wrote Tuesday night. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., compared how Democrats treated Trump's impeachment trials versus ""the cabinet member responsible for 9 million illegal migrant entries on the southern border."" ""They show zero interest in demanding real accountability,"" Schmitt said. ""This impeachment coming to the Senate will undoubtedly show how unserious Democrats have become when it comes to responsibly leading the country and protecting Americans. Mayorkas’ impeachment proceedings should be brought to the Senate floor ASAP, but don’t hold your breath for any meaningful change at the border while Democrats are in charge."" Schmitt's sentiments are shared by several Senate Republicans who opposed the failed border bill that was in the national security supplemental package, citing concerns about increased power for President Biden and Mayorkas. They argued that shifting asylum claim responsibilities to the secretary of Homeland Security undermines immigration court processes.

In a statement following the House's vote, DHS spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said: ""House Republicans will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution for political gain rather than working to solve the serious challenges at our border. While Secretary Mayorkas was helping a group of Republican and Democratic Senators develop bipartisan solutions to strengthen border security and get needed resources for enforcement, House Republicans have wasted months with this baseless, unconstitutional impeachment. ""Without a shred of evidence or legitimate Constitutional grounds, and despite bipartisan opposition, House Republicans have falsely smeared a dedicated public servant who has spent more than 20 years enforcing our laws and serving our country.

House Republican defense hawks are pushing for a way to get foreign aid passed through Congress after Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., made clear he would not entertain the Senate’s attempts at doing so. While House GOP leaders have been critical of the Senate passing a multibillion-dollar foreign aid package, there is a large contingent of both Republicans and Democrats who are hoping to see some form of aid for U.S. allies overseas – so much so that top House Democrats are publicly pressuring them to join a bid to end-run Johnson and bring the Senate package to the floor anyway. Nearly all the House Republicans who Fox News Digital heard from said they have not been contacted by the other side but are interested in seeing the aid pass, while others are working on a new plan altogether. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, told reporters on Wednesday that a small group of GOP lawmakers was working on a plan that involved aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific as well as elements of border security.

But even moderate House Republicans poured cold water on the idea. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said ""one or two"" Democrats approached him about signing a discharge petition but that he was not interested at the moment.

Mike Turner's 'cryptic' announcement on 'America Reports.' The U.S. has intelligence of a national and international security threat related to Russian nuclear capabilities in space which could threaten satellites, including potentially knocking out U.S. military communications and reconnaissance, Fox News has learned. Sources tell Fox News that the Russian capability has not yet deployed. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner on Wednesday morning first warned of a ""serious national security threat,"" and called on President Biden to declassify it. HOUSE INTEL CHAIR TURNER WARNS OF 'SERIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT,' URGES BIDEN TO DECLASSIFY ""The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has made available to all Members of Congress information concerning a serious national security threat,"" Turner said. ""I am requesting that President Biden declassify all information relating to this threat so that Congress, the Administration, and our allies can openly discuss the actions necessary to respond to this threat."" Fox News Digital obtained the notice sent to congressional members Wednesday, which pointed to ""an urgent matter with regard to a destabilizing foreign military capability that should be known by all Congressional Policy Makers.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., later attempted to quell any panic caused by Turner's statement by explaining that last month, he sent a letter to the White House ""requesting a meeting with the president to discuss a serious national security issue that is classified."" ""In response to that letter, a meeting is now scheduled tomorrow on this matter here at the Capitol with the Gang of Four and with the president's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan,"" Johnson said. ""I will press the administration to take appropriate action, and everybody can be comforted by that."" Johnson said he ""saw Chairman Turner's statement on the issue, and I want to assure the American people there's no need for public alarm."" ""We are going to work together to address this matter as we do all sensitive matters that are classified,"" Johnson said. ""And beyond that, I'm not at liberty to disclose classified information and really can't say much of that, but we just want to assure everyone, steady hands are at the wheel, we're working on it.

""In the meantime, we must be cautious about potentially disclosing sources and methods that may be key to preserving a range of options for U.S. action."" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday at the White House press briefing said that he was surprised by Turner's statement, given that earlier in the week he reached out to members of Congress to offer himself to come to Capitol Hill to give a personal briefing on the matter. That briefing will take place on Thursday. ""I am a bit surprised that Congressman Turner came out publicly today in advance of a meeting on the books for me to go sit with him alongside our intelligence and defense professionals tomorrow. That’s his choice to do that,"" Sullivan said. ""All I can tell you is that I’m focused on going to see him, sit with him, as well as the other House members of the Gang of Eight tomorrow, and I’m not in a position to say anything further from this podium at this time, other than to make the broad point that this administration has gone further, and in more creative, more strategic ways, dealt with the declassification of intelligence in the national interest of the United States than any administration in history,"" he continued. Sullivan added: ""You definitely are not going to find an unwillingness to do that when it’s in our national security interest to do so."" He said, however, that the administration has prioritized ""the issue of sources and methods."" ""Ultimately, these are decisions for the president to make, but in the meantime, the most important thing is we have the opportunity to sit in a classified setting and have the kind of conversation with the House Intelligence leadership that I, in fact, had scheduled before Congressman Turner went out today,"" Sullivan said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sullivan again stressed that he ""personally reached out"" to Congress on the matter.

(Candice Ward/Getty Images) On the eve of Valentine's Day and Ash Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was impeached in a historic vote over his mishandling of the illegal immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. T hree Republican lawmakers, Reps. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., Ken Buck, R-Colo., and Tom McClintock, R-Calif., jumped the aisle to vote against the impeachment. The 214-213 vote came after the first impeachment failed earlier this month. Every House Democrat showed up to protect the cabinet secretary, including Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who temporarily left the hospital where he was recovering from surgery to cast his vote. Once Rep. Steve Scalise returned to D.C. from a cancer treatment, the GOP had the numbers to advance the articles of impeachment. House Republicans have accused Mayorkas of violating his oath to defend the U.S. by failing to secure the border and ""refusing"" to enforce immigration laws. The three Republicans who voted against impeachment on Tuesday have criticized Mayorkas' handling of the border but expressed reservations over whether it rose to the level of impeachment. McClintock warned it could set a precedent for political impeachments that could harm Republican officials in the future. This is the first time a Cabinet secretary has been impeached by the U.S. Congress since 1876. It's now up to the Senate — where Democrats run the show — to hold an impeachment trial. Reps.

Gavin Newsom Democrat strategists and members of the media continually mention him as a future presidential hopeful, but that future could come sooner rather than later should Biden's plans change. 2. Vice President Harris Harris' presidential ambitions have been known since her first unsuccessful run for the White House in 2020, when she failed to gain support over her Democrat primary opponents, including Biden. Despite her low approval rating and frequent gaffes as vice president, she continues to insist she's ""ready to serve"" as commander in chief, if necessary. 3. Former first lady Michelle Obama Obama has been one of the more surprising names floated as a potential replacement for Biden, considering her lack of political experience. But she remains popular to Democrats, and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy keeps floating the possibility. 4. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Despite declining a run for the White House , Whitmer appeared to leave the door open for a future presidential run after her convincing re-election win during the 2022 midterm elections, a year that was expected to be a difficult one for Democrats. 5. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear Beshear has been seen as a rising star within the party given his status as one of the most popular governors in the country, despite being a Democrat leading a red state. That status grew following a big re-election win last year over then-Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who was considered a rising GOP star.

Comey moment? An anonymous Biden official revealed some behind-the-scenes reaction to Special Counsel Robert Hur's report on the president's mishandling of classified materials. The special counsel determined that no charges should be brought against the president. But it also delivered devastating statements about the president's memory. ""It felt like a Comey moment for me,"" one Biden official reportedly told Politico, referring to the moment then-FBI Director James Comey released a letter, weeks before the 2016 election, stating that he would be investigating classified materials from Hillary Clinton that appeared to have been mishandled. Biden defended himself Thursday night in a raucous press conference , where he said his memory was ""fine."" A short time later, he referred to the president of Egypt as the president of Mexico. President Joe Biden held a press conference in response to Special Counsel Robert Hur's description of his age and memory.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nato-comments-trigger-fierce-media-european-opposition-how-serious-he,"close Video The media doesn’t allow the public to hear what Trump has to say: Robby Soave Reason senior editor Robby Soave and Democratic strategist Ameshia Cross join ‘MediaBuzz’ to discuss the Supreme Court appearing to tilt towards Trump in the Colorado ballot case. Donald Trump has made some news that is reverberating around the world. It wasn’t him saying – after that incredible Super Bowl comeback by Kansas City – that he signed a law boosting earnings for musicians so Taylor Swift shouldn’t endorse Joe Biden (also ""I like her boyfriend, Travis""). It wasn’t ""we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country, we will rout the Fake News Media, we will Drain the Swamp."" It’s not that he told a South Carolina rally that "" Biden's thugs are still trying to put me in jail on fake charges for crimes that they openly admit that Crooked Joe did. He actually did these crimes"" – while adding ""I’m not looking for anything to happen to this guy."" WHY BIDEN’S ANGER AND DEFENSIVENESS INFLAMED ANXIETY ABOUT HIS MEMORY ISSUES No, it’s about NATO. Trump recalled a conversation with the president ""of a big country,"" who he says asked him if they didn’t increase their defense contribution to the North Atlantic alliance ""and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?"" Sharing his response at the rally, Trump claims he said: ""You didn’t pay. You’re delinquent… No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want."" The idea that Vladimir Putin could do ""whatever the hell they want"" set off alarm bells, not only among foreign policy officials in Europe but in much of the mainstream media here at home. One potential impact would be on Ukraine, with Trump having declined to endorse more military aid to that weakened country, which would allow Russia’s unprovoked invasion to succeed in either keeping its territorial gains along the eastern border or capturing the entire sovereign nation. And yet there is further evidence, as if any were needed, that the GOP is now Trump’s party. Some of the biggest Republican hawks, who staunchly supported NATO in the past, say they have no problem with the former president’s remarks.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images) As the Washington Post points out, Lindsey Graham said when he ran for president in 2016 that Trump’s comments had made Putin a ""very happy man."" On Sunday, the senator said he was ""not worried"" about Trump’s latest remarks ""at all."" Tom Cotton, another leading hawk, said in 2016 that America must ""make sure that we stand by NATO and we stand for countries like Ukraine and Georgia"" who face ""Russian aggression, and recognize Vladimir Putin as the adversary he is."" On Sunday, the senator said NATO countries not paying their full share are ""already encouraging Russian aggression, and President Trump is simply ringing the warning bell."" UKRAINE AID PACKAGE WOULD BE USED TO IMPEACH TRUMP, SEN VANCE WARNS Marco Rubio said in 2018 that Trump went too far by ""questioning the value of the alliance,"" tweeting: ""The end of #NATO would be a dream come true for #Putin."" On Sunday, the senator said he had ""zero"" concerns about Trump’s latest comments and suggested he didn’t mean them: ""We’ve already been through this. ""You would think people would’ve figured it out by now."" And here’s the kicker: Rubio and Graham pushed through a bill barring any president from withdrawing from NATO. I wonder who they might have had in mind? Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump walks out to speak at a Get Out The Vote campaign rally held at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, South Carolina, on Feb 10. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Look, I get it. This is how Trump negotiates. During his first term he regularly questioned the value of the NATO alliance as a way of getting some country to keep their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, with some success. It’s an approach he honed as a businessman when he would threaten to walk away from a deal unless certain conditions were met. But when Trump took office with little experience in foreign policy, he was talked out of any withdrawal by such retired generals as Jim Mattis and John Kelly. The New York Times reports this anecdote: ""Soon after former President Donald J. Trump took office, his staff explained how NATO’s mutual defense obligations worked. ""‘You mean, if Russia attacked Lithuania, we would go to war with Russia?’ he responded. ‘That’s crazy.’ Mr. Trump has never believed in the fundamental one-for-all-and-all-for-one concept of the Atlantic alliance."" But Trump has made clear that in a second term he would surround himself with loyalists who would not attempt to stop such decisions. Senior adviser Jason Miller says Biden has reversed Trump’s approach to NATO: ""Democrat and media pearl-clutchers seem to have forgotten that we had four years of peace and prosperity under President Trump, but Europe saw death and destruction under Obama-Biden and now more death and destruction under Biden."" FINLAND CENTER-RIGHT CANDIDATE ALEXANDER STUBB DECLARES PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY WITH NEARLY 52% OF VOTE Much of the media are leading the charge on NATO. CNN’s Christiane Amanpour called Trump’s latest comments ""insane."" It’s also true that top European officials are being quoted on the record as criticizing Trump’s language. They would be irresponsible if they didn’t start plotting a Plan B. European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 28, 2022. (REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo) The crux of the argument is that the alliance created in the wake of World War II has worked well in deterring war and doesn’t need to be fixed. I happen to be in that camp – and the only time the mutual defense pact has been invoked was when our allies aided us after the Sept. 11 attacks.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-bidens-anger-defensiveness-inflamed-anxiety-his-memory-issues,"close Video Jen Psaki hits media coverage of Biden special counsel report: 'Banging your head against the wall' Former WH Press Secretary Jen Psaki hammered the media coverage of the Special Counsel report on President Biden’s handling of classified documents on Sunday. President Biden took a setback and turned it into a debacle. It’s not like it had never occurred to anyone that an 81-year-old president seeking a second term was problematic. There has been a growing debate about whether Biden has the mental acuity and physical stamina for the job. Even a majority of Democrats say in polls that he shouldn’t run again. I have been saying for a couple of years now, every chance I get, that it’s a mistake for the president’s advisers to shield him from the media. It makes him look disengaged. It takes him out of the news cycle. It leaves a void that is filled by Donald Trump . It’s a surrender of the world’s biggest bully pulpit. The guy even turned down a Super Bowl interview for the second straight year, passing up a massive audience. MEDIA BUILDS UP AROUND TAYLOR SWIFT, SUPER BOWL LVIII AS BIDEN SEEKS SWIFT’S ENDORSEMENT What Biden’s inner circle is doing, of course, is protecting him from making gaffes (which he has done his whole life). Instead, he puts out statements, which get little play. Even when the military launched retaliatory airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, the commander-in-chief remained silent. President Biden sits in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Feb. 9, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) My view is that making mistakes is a small price to pay for being on camera, providing video that drives television and the web. Biden may be working hard behind the scenes, but if voters don’t see you out there leading, they will wonder why you vanished – especially with your likely opponent constantly engaging with journalists. Taking a couple of questions from reporters and providing terse answers, often over the roar of a helicopter, just doesn’t cut it. Biden had a tough time on the memory front last week. He spent 30 painful seconds trying to think of ""Hamas"" until a reporter supplied the name. He mixed up Emmanuel Macron and the late Francois Mitterand. Then, telling the same anecdote, he described what German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had told him in 2021, except the leader died four years earlier. Then came the special counsel’s report. The good news – no indictment for mishandling classified documents – was immediately overshadowed by Robert Hur’s description of the president. The most stinging quote: ""a well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" So poor that no jury would convict him. INFIGHTING CONTINUES AT NEW YORK TIMES AS STAFFERS COMPLAIN ABOUT LGBTQ COVERAGE Biden, said Hur, couldn’t remember what years he had served as VP or the year that his son died. The president, Kamala Harris and the White House all said that Hur, originally a Trump appointee, had no business including such gratuitous insults. Attacking the prosecutor is a well-worn tactic, also practiced by the likes of Trump and Bill Clinton. No matter. A special counsel had given an official stamp of approval to public concerns and anxieties about the president’s mental fitness and his staff had no business letting the boss do five hours of interviews on the two days after Hamas massacred Israelis. But this is when Biden made things far, far worse. Privately cursing and furious, according to several media accounts, he decided to hold a rare news conference – the press was given a 20-minute warning – and poured kerosene on the fire. Biden sounded angry, petty and defensive – a ""crotchety grandpa,"" in the words of New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. He expressed outrage: ""There's even a reference that I don't remember when my son died. How dare he raise that?"" Much of the mainstream media, along with many allies in the Democratic Party, had a come-to-Jesus moment last week, realizing President Biden’s memory is a significant problem for the 81-year-old as he seeks re-election. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images) And he turned his ire against the press, by turns combative and mocking. ""I'm well-meaning, and I'm an elderly man, and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been president. I put this country back on its feet,"" Biden said. As for his memory, ""take a look at what I've done since I became president. None of you thought I could pass any of the things I got passed. How'd that happen? You know, I guess I just forgot what was going on."" NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS SUGGEST BIDEN'S MEMORY COULD BE HUGE FACTOR IN FUTURE CRISIS CNN’s M.J. Lee uncorked a long and confrontational question before being cut off by the president: ""While many American people have been watching and they have expressed concerns about your age –"" ""That is your judgment,"" Biden snapped. ""That is your judgment. That is not the judgment of the press."" But it certainly showed up in poll after poll. ""They expressed concerns about your mental acuity,"" Lee said. ""They say that you are too old. Mr. President, in December you told me that you believe there are many other Democrats who could defeat Donald Trump. So why does it have to be you now? What is your answer?"" Former President Donald Trump speaks on Feb. 9, 2024, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. (Spencer Platt) ""Cause I'm the most qualified person in this country to be president of the United States and finish the job I started,"" he shot back. Oh, and he described Egyptian leader Abdel al-Sisi as the president of Mexico. It was a train wreck. His worst traits were on display. What might have been a two-day flap over the report turned into a chaotic melodrama, with reporters shouting to be recognized. This has the feeling of a turning point. Even though the 77-year-old Trump has had his missteps, confusing Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi, Biden seems more frail in the way he walks and talks, but it is too late for the Democrats to change horses now. The president has nine months to convince the country that he’s up to the job. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Footnote : Politico says in a report that ""top party operatives are warning Biden aides that the president cannot retreat in response to the special counsel report that fueled concerns over his age and mental faculties. They say President Joe Biden, having largely [shielded] away from interviews and press conferences, needs to be out in public far more. ""They want to see him engage with the press and voters in the off-script and punchy exchanges he’s been known for in the past, which they believe will help chip away at concerns about the president’s mental acuity. They say that it’s worth the risk of potential slip-ups that could reinforce the image that he’s declining."" Welcome aboard to everyone who thinks Biden should do more media. I wonder if he’ll take the advice.
